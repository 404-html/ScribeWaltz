1
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Speaker 1>All</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.563
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to mix it up this week and </v>

3
00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:09.080
<v Speaker 2>talk about something a little less </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial than usual feminism.</v>

4
00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Everyone agrees on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.151
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

6
00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:11.984
<v Speaker 2>That's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guest this week is Christina Hoff </v>

7
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:15.284
<v Speaker 2>summers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina is a former philosophy </v>

8
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:18.134
<v Speaker 2>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>author and a speaker for the American </v>

9
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Enterprise Institute known for her </v>
<v Speaker 2>critique of late 20th century feminism.</v>

10
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.083
<v Speaker 2>Over the past few months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've become familiar with Christina </v>

11
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 2>because her name kept popping up all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over my twitter feed at first related to</v>

12
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Gamergate and now because of her tongue </v>
<v Speaker 2>and cheek commentary on campus,</v>

13
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 2>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger warnings and safe spaces.</v>

14
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.123
<v Speaker 2>Actually thanks to twitter and to all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you who've helped connect me with </v>

15
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.274
<v Speaker 2>likeminded people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The show is really taken off in a way I </v>

16
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:46.154
<v Speaker 2>couldn't have imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly I find myself immersed with </v>

17
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:49.424
<v Speaker 2>people I truly admire and respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all talking to each other in </v>

18
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:55.580
<v Speaker 2>various mediums and strengthening the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideals we stand for,</v>

19
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 2>even if we don't agree on every specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

20
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.833
<v Speaker 2>One such an issue that I haven't tackled</v>
<v Speaker 2>too deeply yet is feminism and that's </v>

21
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:07.700
<v Speaker 2>exactly why I wanted to have Christina </v>
<v Speaker 2>on as an equity feminists.</v>

22
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Christina cares about both women's and </v>
<v Speaker 2>men's rights.</v>

23
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 2>You know that whole two things can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>true at once.</v>

24
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.993
<v Speaker 2>Idea that I've been talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say that feminism in and of </v>

25
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.400
<v Speaker 2>itself isn't one of my bread and butter </v>
<v Speaker 2>topics.</v>

26
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 2>As you guys know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love discussing politics,</v>

27
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and secularism and more,</v>

28
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.080
<v Speaker 2>but haven't done a ton on the topic of </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism.</v>

29
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument could be made that feminism</v>

30
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 2>and the fight for women's rights is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute through line.</v>

31
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Through all of the topics I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned.</v>

32
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where women are treated with equality,</v>

33
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 2>we see fair societies with more secular </v>
<v Speaker 2>values and less radicalism.</v>

34
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.433
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor is it something that should be </v>

35
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 2>overlooked.</v>

36
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>

37
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 2>it should be embraced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a society treats their women fairly,</v>

38
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 2>it is almost always a more successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

39
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.323
<v Speaker 2>On every other front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the battle for equality of women has </v>

40
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 2>been different all over the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>continues in almost every form today.</v>

41
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the main issues that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to discuss with Christina.</v>

42
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.030
<v Speaker 2>How is the battle for equality evolved </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years?</v>

43
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Have there been unintended consequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>by coming so far in the battle?</v>

44
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Has Feminism morphed into something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist of the 19 sixties wouldn't even</v>

45
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:14.294
<v Speaker 2>recognize today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens when an equality </v>

46
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 2>movement actually accomplishes its </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals?</v>

47
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Do we move on to what's next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the battle never truly end.</v>

48
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.103
<v Speaker 2>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a lot of questions and I hope </v>

49
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Christina has some of the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

50
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:28.244
<v Speaker 2>the battle for women's rights is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same battle that has been fought by the </v>

51
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:31.700
<v Speaker 2>other for all time.</v>

52
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.760
<v Speaker 2>I want women to have 100 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity that men have.</v>

53
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I want the doors to be open and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>glass ceiling to be shattered.</v>

54
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Winning these battles doesn't mean it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to come at the expense of men,</v>

55
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:41.954
<v Speaker 2>nor does it mean that men should </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly become less than women and at </v>

56
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:45.734
<v Speaker 2>the same time we should acknowledge the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexes are actually different and that's </v>

57
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:51.410
<v Speaker 2>okay too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From our hunter gatherer days to today,</v>

58
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:52.244
<v Speaker 2>gender roles have existed long before </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of us pretending there aren't some </v>

59
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 2>differences in the sexist won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>magically make it true.</v>

60
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.823
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps we can try to embrace these </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences rather than tacking labels </v>

61
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:03.784
<v Speaker 2>on everyone and thinking that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>group's equality can only come at the </v>

62
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:07.564
<v Speaker 2>expense of another group's opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If men are from Mars and women are from </v>

63
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:11.524
<v Speaker 2>Venus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then perhaps it's time we brought both </v>

64
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:13.714
<v Speaker 2>sexes back to Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guest this week is a speaker and </v>

65
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>author and host of the factual feminist </v>
<v Speaker 2>on youtube.</v>

66
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 2>She's known as based mom by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gamergate gang and just finished a three</v>

67
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:26.974
<v Speaker 2>hour conversation with Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I hope you have a little something </v>

68
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina Hoff sommers.</v>

69
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lovely to be here.</v>

70
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a little something?</v>

71
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.300
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

72
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm just getting started.</v>

73
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did you did three?</v>

74
00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Did he go a little over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where were you with your long?</v>

75
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Just his little man cave there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the very cozy little studio.</v>

76
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.653
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right before is that now we were saying </v>

77
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 2>how there's this new gang sort of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has appeared sort of you,</v>

78
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milo,</v>

79
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:53.944
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few other people that sort of have </v>

80
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:55.924
<v Speaker 2>magically connected even though just </v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago we really didn't know each </v>

81
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 2>other and yet we're all talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the same stuff.</v>

82
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>

83
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

84
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.693
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that what we are is we're </v>

85
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:06.874
<v Speaker 3>rejecting the cultural authoritarians </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we come from different political </v>

86
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.363
<v Speaker 3>places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we share this commitment to freedom </v>

87
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just live and let live.</v>

88
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 3>What happened to that?</v>

89
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 2>What happened to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

90
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:19.924
<v Speaker 2>so I want to spend a lot of time talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the cultural libertarians and the </v>

91
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 2>authoritarians and all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But first let's start somewhere else.</v>

92
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:28.354
<v Speaker 2>Let's start with based mom because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the phrase that popped up many </v>

93
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 2>times and I see people tweeting this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime I'm involved in a,</v>

94
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 2>in a twitter thing with you based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

95
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 2>what does that actually mean for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>

96
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:38.030
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

97
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.420
<v Speaker 3>first I thought it meant cool mom and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was happy with that,</v>

98
00:04:41.421 --> 00:04:42.254
<v Speaker 3>but it turns out it means something very</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive and just as good but different </v>

99
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.813
<v Speaker 3>in the lingo of the gamers and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>they got it from a rap song or </v>

100
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.850
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but based means grounded,</v>

101
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.000
<v Speaker 3>authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no bs they would say.</v>

102
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.403
<v Speaker 3>And I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I am and I'm happy to be </v>

103
00:04:59.151 --> 00:05:00.500
<v Speaker 3>based mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like being a mom,</v>

104
00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:01.334
<v Speaker 3>which I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And being based is obviously a good </v>

105
00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:03.704
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

106
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

107
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

108
00:05:06.361 --> 00:05:08.430
<v Speaker 2>so let's start with the factual </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist.</v>

109
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.293
<v Speaker 2>Let's go there first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do a little history of </v>

110
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:11.244
<v Speaker 2>feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what brought you personally to be </v>

111
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:17.280
<v Speaker 2>doing these types of videos and talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this stuff?</v>

112
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:18.114
<v Speaker 2>Just your journey a little.</v>

113
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been a,</v>

114
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 3>I was a professor for many years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote skull scholarly articles and books</v>

115
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:29.611
<v Speaker 3>and I wasn't doing videos on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was at the time I thought</v>

116
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:30.690
<v Speaker 3>it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

117
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.120
<v Speaker 3>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still mostly,</v>

118
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 3>but it's still mostly cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

119
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.063
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this young man came to a Gi and </v>

120
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.433
<v Speaker 3>wanted to get the scholars on the air </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he did videos with all of us and </v>

121
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 3>then he came to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

122
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 3>we want to put you on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to have a weekly show,</v>

123
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:51.420
<v Speaker 3>just come and talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said about what,</v>

124
00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:52.790
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

125
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 3>it's no more than five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferably for and how do I do that?</v>

126
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 3>But I started to do it and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

127
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 3>once a week approximately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will go on and correct a feminist myth</v>

128
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 3>because there are so many.</v>

129
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.063
<v Speaker 3>And I just wanted the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason with people to analyze some of </v>

130
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 3>these factoids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>factoids.</v>

131
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:16.240
<v Speaker 3>We are in an inundated with ms dot </v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

132
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 3>if you excuse the pun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just false information about women.</v>

133
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 3>They tend to exaggerate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

134
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:22.304
<v Speaker 3>these researchers slash activist tend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>exaggerate women's vulnerability and to </v>

135
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:26.984
<v Speaker 3>overstate the strength of men when in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact it's a complicated mix of benefits </v>

136
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 3>and burdens for both sexes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when they say,</v>

137
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:35.444
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women are being cheated out of twenty </v>

138
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 3>three cents on the dollar and one for </v>
<v Speaker 3>being sexually assaulted,</v>

139
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.723
<v Speaker 3>it just turns out these ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>exaggerations and the truth is entirely </v>

140
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:50.204
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I just patiently tried to expose </v>

141
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 3>the myths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I first started,</v>

142
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 3>my mother said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well darling,</v>

143
00:06:57.891 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 3>are you going to run out of topics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

144
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:00.674
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will never run out of topics because </v>

145
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 3>we have had going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

146
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:05.234
<v Speaker 3>three decades of specious research </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out of gender studies and it all </v>

147
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:12.770
<v Speaker 3>needs to be reconsidered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of it might be right.</v>

148
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I occasionally,</v>

149
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:18.851
<v Speaker 3>I find something that's not a just </v>
<v Speaker 3>twisted into I'm a myth.</v>

150
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I correct a myth every week.</v>

151
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before we dive right into the </v>

152
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:28.990
<v Speaker 2>feminist of how do you like being in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this space,</v>

153
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.853
<v Speaker 2>because obviously it is new to you to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the youtube space and interacting </v>

154
00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:37.741
<v Speaker 2>with people and twitter and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

155
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.230
<v Speaker 2>did you ever expect to be sort of a hero</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Gamer gay community?</v>

156
00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:42.064
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about that later too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just being in this interesting </v>

157
00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:45.300
<v Speaker 2>digital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new thing.</v>

158
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

159
00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:47.064
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember a few years ago before I was </v>

160
00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:51.870
<v Speaker 3>on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

161
00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:52.710
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never do that.</v>

162
00:07:52.711 --> 00:07:54.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

163
00:07:54.181 --> 00:07:56.520
<v Speaker 3>it was unapproachable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well now I can't get off.</v>

164
00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 3>It's so addicting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

165
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.653
<v Speaker 3>I didn't expect it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm happy to do it because here's </v>

166
00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:04.110
<v Speaker 3>the thing about that I like about </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>

167
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.113
<v Speaker 3>so I don't just give a message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I link if people are interested and try </v>

168
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.154
<v Speaker 3>to back up everything I say with solid </v>
<v Speaker 3>scholarship and link I linked to the </v>

169
00:08:12.001 --> 00:08:12.834
<v Speaker 3>best sources I can find or to my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>work that I've done for over the </v>

170
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.693
<v Speaker 3>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I linked to books and articles if </v>

171
00:08:18.661 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 3>people are interested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

172
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.560
<v Speaker 3>it's as if all of my writing has a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

173
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also very validating,</v>

174
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:25.144
<v Speaker 2>I think to be in the space that we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's so much misinformation </v>

175
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.953
<v Speaker 2>related to whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's feminism or political </v>

176
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:33.490
<v Speaker 2>correctness or any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many bad actors.</v>

177
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:36.670
<v Speaker 2>I think in this space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's angry people,</v>

178
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.833
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for us it's nice that we can be </v>

179
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:39.160
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

180
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.490
<v Speaker 2>here's some information and then we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>go back and forth when we want and it's,</v>

181
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

182
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.570
<v Speaker 2>it's very freeing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find and then when I'm able to connect</v>

183
00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:48.670
<v Speaker 2>with like minded people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it to be great.</v>

184
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I find it great and all I ever wanted as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a college professor,</v>

185
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:53.434
<v Speaker 3>I never saw it as my position to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>replicate my view of the world in the </v>

186
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:01.050
<v Speaker 3>minds of my students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heaven forbid I wanted to open the world</v>

187
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:01.884
<v Speaker 3>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show them the best that was thought and </v>

188
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:04.644
<v Speaker 3>said on different contentious issues in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in metaphysics and ethics as well as </v>

189
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:09.174
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was teaching occasionally would </v>

190
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 3>teach gender theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I taught gender theory,</v>

191
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:15.370
<v Speaker 3>I found that there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

192
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.213
<v Speaker 3>the closed mindedness combined with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a pension for conspiracy </v>

193
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 3>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paranoid theories about the patriarchy.</v>

194
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:26.160
<v Speaker 3>That didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not to exist,</v>

195
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 3>at least not certainly not in the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States or western Europe.</v>

196
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.263
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

197
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought if I had my ideal university,</v>

198
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 3>I would take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have some radicals there because</v>

199
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 3>you can always learn from people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are pushing the envelope.</v>

200
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.563
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't only have radicals and </v>

201
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 3>engender scholarship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may be a bit of an overstatement,</v>

202
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think so really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all we have.</v>

203
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before we get told that,</v>

204
00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:49.544
<v Speaker 2>let's back up a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just lay out some basic </v>

205
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:51.974
<v Speaker 2>definitions because I do find that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these people don't even </v>

206
00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:56.090
<v Speaker 2>understand what a feminist is anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

207
00:09:56.091 --> 00:09:58.130
<v Speaker 2>you have your first wave feminist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>second wave feminist,</v>

208
00:09:58.131 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 2>third wave feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's things beyond that that,</v>

209
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.410
<v Speaker 2>that you've coined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>

210
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:05.170
<v Speaker 2>can you just break down some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic what,</v>

211
00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.220
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the first feminist movement?</v>

212
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Just give me a couple.</v>

213
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.753
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be the suffrage movement and </v>

214
00:10:11.891 --> 00:10:16.120
<v Speaker 3>that was the struggle for the vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after,</v>

215
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.760
<v Speaker 3>when women earn the vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

216
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.653
<v Speaker 3>there was a period of queen essence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't hear much from feminists </v>

217
00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:24.000
<v Speaker 3>throughout the thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forties,</v>

218
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.400
<v Speaker 3>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it came back in the late sixties,</v>

219
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.263
<v Speaker 3>early seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was the second wave and it had </v>

220
00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:31.054
<v Speaker 3>worked to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were a lot of just arbitrary </v>

221
00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:36.490
<v Speaker 3>barriers preventing women holding women </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

222
00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:39.940
<v Speaker 3>They needed to be taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was obviously time to do that.</v>

223
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.350
<v Speaker 2>And this was more like in the workforce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

224
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.000
<v Speaker 3>Changing the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing education.</v>

225
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm addressing things of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

226
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.253
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>legally for women to have more defenses </v>

227
00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 3>against harassment in the workplace and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so forth.</v>

228
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.580
<v Speaker 3>All of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was totally on board.</v>

229
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.473
<v Speaker 3>That's just basic quest for equality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what happened is that the second </v>

230
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:04.284
<v Speaker 3>wave of feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the women in the universities </v>

231
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 3>were quite radical and they were not </v>
<v Speaker 3>about equality.</v>

232
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.870
<v Speaker 3>They were not about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see feminism,</v>

233
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:13.704
<v Speaker 3>the best of feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It came from the European enlightenment </v>

234
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.493
<v Speaker 3>and it was about the intrinsic dignity </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all men and women and extending </v>

235
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.500
<v Speaker 3>equality of opportunity and liberty and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so forth to,</v>

236
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.050
<v Speaker 3>to all they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of them rejecting enlightenment.</v>

237
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.870
<v Speaker 3>And they're not about freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of expression.</v>

238
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:34.620
<v Speaker 3>And they are really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use their classrooms,</v>

239
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:35.454
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to promote a very rigid worldview about </v>

240
00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:38.874
<v Speaker 3>how women are preyed upon by men and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost as if the as if better </v>

241
00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:44.700
<v Speaker 3>things got for women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more bitter they became,</v>

242
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.013
<v Speaker 3>and I watched this from close up because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was teaching in the University of </v>

243
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.733
<v Speaker 3>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept thinking they would be </v>

244
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:50.994
<v Speaker 3>discredited because it their views will </v>
<v Speaker 3>not withstand 20 minutes in a seminar </v>

245
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:56.674
<v Speaker 3>room with some just objective scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they do not subject their research </v>

246
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.520
<v Speaker 3>to scrutiny of objective scholars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They receive the evaluate one another.</v>

247
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.443
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was this a strange example of where </v>

248
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.394
<v Speaker 2>things could exist sort of in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic world where perhaps they </v>

249
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:13.444
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These ideas wouldn't have played out in </v>

250
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:14.960
<v Speaker 2>the real world?</v>

251
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't and I didn't see them in the</v>

252
00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:17.804
<v Speaker 3>real world and I thought they would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>contained in the academy and then would </v>

253
00:12:21.171 --> 00:12:22.004
<v Speaker 3>go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That has not happened because partly </v>

254
00:12:24.501 --> 00:12:27.680
<v Speaker 3>because of social media and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter mobs and things.</v>

255
00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:32.681
<v Speaker 3>It's come into the mainstream and now we</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear these words like trigger warning or</v>

256
00:12:34.261 --> 00:12:37.400
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get plenty of that issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>to trigger warning before we sat down.</v>

257
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should have.</v>

258
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a walking trigger warning.</v>

259
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you consider this a safe space?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling fairly,</v>

260
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.010
<v Speaker 3>fairly frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little microaggressive pond,</v>

261
00:12:49.011 --> 00:12:50.120
<v Speaker 3>but not so much.</v>

262
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:51.481
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

263
00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:53.940
<v Speaker 2>So then that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was second wave feminism,</v>

264
00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way.</v>

265
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Was involved into that</v>

266
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.883
<v Speaker 3>second wave had a radical extreme and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that extreme became the mean because </v>

267
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:04.090
<v Speaker 3>they got a monopoly on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

268
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.180
<v Speaker 3>professorships</v>

269
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.120
<v Speaker 2>and that's what you would refer to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>as third wave feminism.</v>

270
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:08.670
<v Speaker 3>The third.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

271
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Third way was probably the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intersectional feminism.</v>

272
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Are there various names for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

273
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.990
<v Speaker 3>it didn't correct the excesses of second</v>
<v Speaker 3>wave feminism.</v>

274
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.080
<v Speaker 3>It took those excesses and made them </v>
<v Speaker 3>even more extreme.</v>

275
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:22.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

276
00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:23.850
<v Speaker 2>what would you say to the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>

277
00:13:23.851 --> 00:13:25.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all along that ride,</v>

278
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:26.603
<v Speaker 2>even though even if they were to </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge some of the things that </v>

279
00:13:28.081 --> 00:13:29.670
<v Speaker 2>you're saying all along that ride </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

280
00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:31.710
<v Speaker 2>basically we're getting better for </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

281
00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:34.320
<v Speaker 2>So maybe there was some reasoning </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind,</v>

282
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.343
<v Speaker 3>there was some reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at a certain point what you had is </v>

284
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:39.643
<v Speaker 3>just people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of a power grab and there </v>

285
00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:46.340
<v Speaker 3>were women like me can cal poly a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarian feminist,</v>

286
00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:47.210
<v Speaker 3>dissonant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminist.</v>

287
00:13:47.211 --> 00:13:48.044
<v Speaker 3>We were just disinvited from to a party </v>
<v Speaker 3>and students didn't have the benefit of </v>

288
00:13:52.851 --> 00:13:56.000
<v Speaker 3>hearing a range of opinion and </v>
<v Speaker 3>contentious issues.</v>

289
00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Take something like something like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wage gap it.</v>

290
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.053
<v Speaker 3>If you are an economist and you hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>that group a is earning less than </v>

291
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Groupie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

292
00:14:06.051 --> 00:14:09.890
<v Speaker 3>you want to know why they immediately </v>
<v Speaker 3>say discrimination.</v>

293
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.793
<v Speaker 3>They blame employers and the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you do the proper controls that </v>

294
00:14:14.751 --> 00:14:16.850
<v Speaker 3>any competent economist would do and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask,</v>

295
00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:18.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they differ in any way?</v>

296
00:14:18.741 --> 00:14:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Do all the men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when you hear that wage gap,</v>

297
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:21.734
<v Speaker 3>they're just doing the average of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the men in the workplace working full </v>

298
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:26.030
<v Speaker 3>time and all the women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

299
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.780
<v Speaker 3>men and women do not study the same top </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjects in college.</v>

300
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.010
<v Speaker 3>They do not work the same number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

301
00:14:32.011 --> 00:14:34.910
<v Speaker 3>And then on average work more hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take more dangerous jobs,</v>

302
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.200
<v Speaker 3>women are far more likely to take a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>years out of the workplace or more.</v>

303
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.513
<v Speaker 3>These are relevant to your earnings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then what happens when we do the </v>

304
00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:46.730
<v Speaker 3>proper controls and they're very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>

305
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.201
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

306
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:48.034
<v Speaker 3>the Labor Department commissioned a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastic study that did all proper </v>

307
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:52.214
<v Speaker 3>controls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets to a point where they're just a </v>

308
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:54.584
<v Speaker 3>few cents you can't explain now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be discrimination and I'm </v>

309
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 3>enough of an equity feminist or worry </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that if I've been cheated out of a</v>

310
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Speaker 3>few pennies or a woman are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but chances are it's not.</v>

311
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Chances are it would turn out if some </v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent explanation.</v>

312
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

313
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.423
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to the wage gaps and </v>

314
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:12.194
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I watched the whole bunch of videos </v>

315
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:14.630
<v Speaker 2>on it before I watched the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it,</v>

316
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:15.523
<v Speaker 2>you did on it before this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And partly what I think is what I think </v>

317
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:20.054
<v Speaker 2>when I watch most political things or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost anything related to news these </v>

318
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.160
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never knew who to trust.</v>

319
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.590
<v Speaker 2>But I watch these studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say this study,</v>

320
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.630
<v Speaker 2>well why was it done this way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who funded this?</v>

321
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Who funded that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you in the mix of all this,</v>

322
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:35.060
<v Speaker 2>figure out what to actually believe</v>

323
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.080
<v Speaker 3>what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

324
00:15:37.081 --> 00:15:39.270
<v Speaker 3>as the factual feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to determine,</v>

325
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

326
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.063
<v Speaker 3>who's the best source?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas who sets the gold standard for </v>

327
00:15:43.741 --> 00:15:47.820
<v Speaker 3>this research?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when it comes to education,</v>

328
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.200
<v Speaker 3>nothing surpasses the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

329
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.550
<v Speaker 3>the Department of Education and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Department of Education,</v>

330
00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:54.563
<v Speaker 3>they collect statistics and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are very good when it comes to </v>

331
00:15:57.271 --> 00:15:58.104
<v Speaker 3>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I believe a feminist activist that </v>

332
00:16:00.211 --> 00:16:01.800
<v Speaker 3>tells me that we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

333
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:02.643
<v Speaker 3>the majority of women or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a quarter of women are being raped </v>

334
00:16:05.011 --> 00:16:07.800
<v Speaker 3>and assaulted and battered or more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

335
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.250
<v Speaker 3>I go to the Bureau of Justice Statistics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at what the,</v>

336
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.113
<v Speaker 3>what do the statisticians who do careful</v>
<v Speaker 3>and highly disciplined as statistical </v>

337
00:16:19.651 --> 00:16:21.120
<v Speaker 3>analyses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they find?</v>

338
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.043
<v Speaker 3>And they find it something very </v>
<v Speaker 3>different and they find out the rape is </v>

339
00:16:24.601 --> 00:16:26.130
<v Speaker 3>a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrendous crime.</v>

340
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:31.460
<v Speaker 3>But it is fairly rare on the campus is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not one in four and a or one in five.</v>

341
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.740
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I present that.</v>

342
00:16:34.741 --> 00:16:35.574
<v Speaker 3>I show people this is what they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are what sort of objective </v>

343
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.150
<v Speaker 3>researchers have found.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are what the advocates have found.</v>

344
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.193
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people just want to believe the </v>

345
00:16:44.221 --> 00:16:45.750
<v Speaker 3>advocates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand that.</v>

346
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:46.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

347
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:48.500
<v Speaker 2>well I do want to touch on that in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>

348
00:16:48.501 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 2>but just to finish up just sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>waves of feminism now.</v>

349
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:53.720
<v Speaker 2>You consider yourself and you coined the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phrase,</v>

350
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I think equity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist,</v>

351
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.350
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can tell people.</v>

352
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.880
<v Speaker 3>So an equity feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you are.</v>

353
00:16:58.881 --> 00:16:59.714
<v Speaker 3>We all are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is someone who wants for women what he </v>

354
00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 3>or she wants for everyone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair treatment?</v>

355
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 3>No discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically comes,</v>

356
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.090
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the enlightenment.</v>

357
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:11.000
<v Speaker 3>It's classical feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about fairness.</v>

358
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even have to be called </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminism.</v>

359
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:19.121
<v Speaker 3>It's probably humanism or people ism or </v>
<v Speaker 3>equalism had I.</v>

360
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.510
<v Speaker 3>that's what I assumed most people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be for today.</v>

361
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.780
<v Speaker 3>Feminism tends to denote people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>carried away with bail bashing.</v>

362
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.750
<v Speaker 3>If I had to reduce it to a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentences,</v>

363
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:33.584
<v Speaker 3>it would be a women are from Venus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>men are from hell and they seem carried </v>

364
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:38.440
<v Speaker 3>away with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

365
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>female chauvinism.</v>

366
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:40.664
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say it.</v>

367
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so from there.</v>

368
00:17:41.731 --> 00:17:42.564
<v Speaker 2>Now let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's backtrack to what you just said </v>

369
00:17:44.071 --> 00:17:46.620
<v Speaker 2>about the campus stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know this is a place where you</v>

370
00:17:46.621 --> 00:17:47.454
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of heat for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you've talked about the rape </v>

371
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:49.850
<v Speaker 2>situation</v>

372
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:50.683
<v Speaker 3>to overland college and everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 3>triggered and 30 people and a dog fled </v>

373
00:17:55.671 --> 00:17:58.220
<v Speaker 3>to a safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a safe room.</v>

374
00:17:58.221 --> 00:17:59.054
<v Speaker 3>There was a therapy dog apparently and </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 triggered young women and they went </v>

375
00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:05.190
<v Speaker 3>to a safe room and they were so.</v>

376
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Which we try to plate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parse that out.</v>

377
00:18:07.361 --> 00:18:09.220
<v Speaker 2>What I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that actually mean?</v>

378
00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:09.971
<v Speaker 2>Because I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

379
00:18:09.971 --> 00:18:12.340
<v Speaker 2>we know what it means and we joke about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

380
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I wish I didn't know what they literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you were coming to speak,</v>

381
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.483
<v Speaker 3>that I would give them ptsd now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have been lecturing on campuses for </v>

382
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.113
<v Speaker 3>years and it used to be they'd come and </v>
<v Speaker 3>argue and sometimes we part as friends </v>

383
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:27.204
<v Speaker 3>or go to a bar and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of have a good time to like human </v>

384
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:30.264
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if someone presents me with some </v>

385
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:34.710
<v Speaker 3>good data and good arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll change my mind.</v>

386
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:37.500
<v Speaker 3>I've changed my mind many times that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>look forward to doing it again,</v>

387
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.013
<v Speaker 3>but who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not just something has changed in </v>

388
00:18:41.281 --> 00:18:45.630
<v Speaker 3>the last few years on the campus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been this medicalization of,</v>

389
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.753
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the curriculum and they need trigger </v>

390
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 3>warnings for their classes and trigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>warnings for this and that.</v>

391
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.433
<v Speaker 3>And as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they needed them for me and they needed </v>

392
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:58.140
<v Speaker 3>a safe space where they could retreat </v>
<v Speaker 3>because as one of them put it,</v>

393
00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:00.990
<v Speaker 3>someone would be invalidating my </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

394
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like the worst thing that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen to you.</v>

395
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.043
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't like a good thing to </v>

396
00:19:04.861 --> 00:19:05.694
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then because you can't just go by </v>

397
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:09.800
<v Speaker 3>your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to test it and,</v>

398
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.680
<v Speaker 3>and see if your interpretation holds up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to criticism.</v>

399
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.490
<v Speaker 3>They were not interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in any kind of criticism.</v>

400
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>

401
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.190
<v Speaker 2>when you hear this happen are new and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see this happen to you and you say,</v>

402
00:19:23.191 --> 00:19:24.024
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the empirical evidence about </v>

403
00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:29.690
<v Speaker 2>what's happening with rape on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they say what?</v>

404
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.543
<v Speaker 2>What is their counter argument?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the counter argument that there's </v>

405
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.710
<v Speaker 2>more rape that goes under reported for </v>
<v Speaker 2>x,</v>

406
00:19:34.711 --> 00:19:36.600
<v Speaker 2>Y,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Z or they're not counting,</v>

407
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls that got drugged or,</v>

408
00:19:39.561 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

409
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:41.244
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that we've become this society </v>

410
00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:45.450
<v Speaker 2>that's afraid of every bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

411
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:46.360
<v Speaker 2>but what's the counter?</v>

412
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they cite their own studies,</v>

413
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.853
<v Speaker 3>but I've spent many years and so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people looking at these </v>

414
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.330
<v Speaker 3>methodological failures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

415
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.670
<v Speaker 3>there are ways in which I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could throw together a survey tonight</v>

416
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.630
<v Speaker 3>and ask people questions and find an </v>
<v Speaker 3>epidemic of whatever you want.</v>

417
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.620
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is ask questions that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are a little vague and it helps to,</v>

418
00:20:07.621 --> 00:20:11.060
<v Speaker 3>to ask a non representative sample of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and um,</v>

419
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.010
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They ask,</v>

420
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.950
<v Speaker 3>they usually a mix of serious questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then a few vague ones.</v>

421
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.990
<v Speaker 3>That's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

422
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 3>does it mean your study is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>valid?</v>

423
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:21.654
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it mean you're going to generate </v>

424
00:20:22.651 --> 00:20:24.930
<v Speaker 3>some useful propaganda for your cars?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

425
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

426
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.080
<v Speaker 2>So I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that piece it at Oberlin.</v>

427
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.310
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing that I saw you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got heat for was um,</v>

428
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cat calling,</v>

429
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this,</v>

430
00:20:36.291 --> 00:20:39.760
<v Speaker 2>this video about cat calling and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of said,</v>

431
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.940
<v Speaker 2>we're written about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not really a thing,</v>

432
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.130
<v Speaker 2>not really thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it exists,</v>

433
00:20:45.131 --> 00:20:47.080
<v Speaker 2>but not a thing to be upset by sort.</v>

434
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's complicated and as I said,</v>

435
00:20:49.171 --> 00:20:51.210
<v Speaker 3>there are times where it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>threatening,</v>

436
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.140
<v Speaker 3>but you have to make distinctions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the basis of thought.</v>

437
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human rationality,</v>

438
00:20:56.971 --> 00:21:00.360
<v Speaker 3>making distinctions and being out in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>public square,</v>

439
00:21:00.361 --> 00:21:03.090
<v Speaker 3>there are going to be interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

440
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.700
<v Speaker 3>people will come up with petitions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people beg for money,</v>

441
00:21:05.701 --> 00:21:09.060
<v Speaker 3>people will say things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just part of being alive.</v>

442
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.080
<v Speaker 3>And these control freaks think that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can police everything that's said on the</v>

443
00:21:15.211 --> 00:21:19.350
<v Speaker 3>street and they were actually suggesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it be against the law to cat call a</v>

444
00:21:19.351 --> 00:21:20.490
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

445
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.353
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make a distinction between somebody </v>

446
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.220
<v Speaker 3>saying hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>

447
00:21:23.221 --> 00:21:24.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>frankly,</v>

448
00:21:24.151 --> 00:21:25.290
<v Speaker 3>that wouldn't bother me.</v>

449
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.560
<v Speaker 3>It might have bothered me when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger,</v>

450
00:21:28.561 --> 00:21:30.420
<v Speaker 3>but as you get older you don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

451
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.580
<v Speaker 3>but when I wish somebody saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>something disgusting or frightening that</v>

452
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.190
<v Speaker 3>is very or stalking you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very different,</v>

453
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.480
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

454
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:44.690
<v Speaker 3>to them it's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all a micro or macro aggression and</v>

455
00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:47.090
<v Speaker 3>they want a law against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

456
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.300
<v Speaker 3>and what I pointed out my video is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Washington DC,</v>

457
00:21:51.301 --> 00:21:55.710
<v Speaker 3>there's a place where you can walk and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you will be cat called and I have walked</v>

458
00:21:55.711 --> 00:21:56.544
<v Speaker 3>there many times and it's in a very busy</v>
<v Speaker 3>part near dupont circle and it's a lot </v>

459
00:21:59.941 --> 00:22:02.070
<v Speaker 3>of women dressed for success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

460
00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:04.920
<v Speaker 3>when their Manolo blahniks they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking through and the men,</v>

461
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.300
<v Speaker 3>well the men are homeless people living </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this park and they make comments.</v>

462
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.900
<v Speaker 3>So there is a huge class difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between these women.</v>

463
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Are we supposed to think these women </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to be protected from these guys who</v>

464
00:22:21.211 --> 00:22:22.470
<v Speaker 3>are the have nots?</v>

465
00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.653
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an interesting discrepancy </v>

466
00:22:24.561 --> 00:22:25.394
<v Speaker 2>that it's not Wall Street bankers </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking down the street making these </v>

467
00:22:27.951 --> 00:22:31.020
<v Speaker 2>comments were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's sort of an added layer of,</v>

468
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.810
<v Speaker 2>of a financial difference in social </v>
<v Speaker 2>status and all that.</v>

469
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
<v Speaker 2>It's usually coming from people beneath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose not always offered it and gave</v>

470
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.080
<v Speaker 2>that enough to dismiss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As,</v>

471
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:45.440
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get what you're saying.</v>

472
00:22:45.441 --> 00:22:46.274
<v Speaker 2>There's a wild discrepancy between you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're cuter whistling at a girl or </v>

473
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.490
<v Speaker 2>versus leering and following you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

474
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.880
<v Speaker 3>think men should know that it bothers </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

475
00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:56.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure it bothers all women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

476
00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.360
<v Speaker 3>I think it depends on the woman and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

477
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.330
<v Speaker 3>it's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

478
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.353
<v Speaker 3>I don't want the women who were the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypersensitive and for sort of freaked </v>

479
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:07.624
<v Speaker 3>out about male attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they should be able to </v>

480
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:13.420
<v Speaker 3>write the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they should consult other women.</v>

481
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.290
<v Speaker 3>What I suspect you would find is that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be annoying.</v>

482
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:18.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

483
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 3>I remember being younger and being </v>
<v Speaker 3>annoyed,</v>

484
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:22.150
<v Speaker 3>but it was mainly a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

485
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.920
<v Speaker 3>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

486
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.460
<v Speaker 3>it didn't happen that much on Wall </v>
<v Speaker 3>Street or in,</v>

487
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.720
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Manhattan,</v>

488
00:23:28.721 --> 00:23:29.554
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there did seem to be an element of a </v>

489
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.610
<v Speaker 3>class involved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

490
00:23:35.611 --> 00:23:38.350
<v Speaker 3>but I think you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

491
00:23:38.351 --> 00:23:41.710
<v Speaker 3>I think in different cultures the women </v>
<v Speaker 3>react to it differently.</v>

492
00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 3>There are different mores and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in my neighborhood in Washington,</v>

493
00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:46.364
<v Speaker 3>D,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>

494
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't see it happening and where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

495
00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.610
<v Speaker 2>So basically what I sense is you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty much saying that your fear</v>

496
00:23:51.611 --> 00:23:52.444
<v Speaker 2>in this would be that if you were to </v>
<v Speaker 2>allow some laws to be passed related to </v>

497
00:23:55.931 --> 00:23:59.650
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff that you're handing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>power over sort of the authoritarian</v>

498
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.233
<v Speaker 3>police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can arrest anybody and it would be </v>

499
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:04.120
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

500
00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.520
<v Speaker 3>I think in dc it would be these poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

501
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

502
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.030
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

503
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:11.063
<v Speaker 3>most men want to be decent human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they should know women don't </v>

504
00:24:13.781 --> 00:24:18.781
<v Speaker 3>appreciate it and that most don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially if it's in,</v>

505
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.793
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of pushy and certainly if it's </v>

506
00:24:22.001 --> 00:24:22.834
<v Speaker 3>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

507
00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:24.123
<v Speaker 3>but then you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't make laws and don't invite the </v>

508
00:24:26.441 --> 00:24:27.274
<v Speaker 3>police in this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much of this event inviting </v>

509
00:24:30.701 --> 00:24:33.730
<v Speaker 3>authorities in and some have called it </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pink police state,</v>

510
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this feminist police state that we have </v>

511
00:24:35.681 --> 00:24:38.980
<v Speaker 3>on campus where your kids and public </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities,</v>

512
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.473
<v Speaker 3>the young men are afraid to tell a joke </v>
<v Speaker 3>or to say anything that comedy clubs </v>

513
00:24:44.501 --> 00:24:47.110
<v Speaker 3>that are afraid to sell they veteran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're unwelcome on campus.</v>

514
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:52.111
<v Speaker 3>It's a hostile environment for humor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why you have to be careful</v>

515
00:24:52.541 --> 00:24:54.460
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes you'll get what you wish </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

516
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.890
<v Speaker 3>but then you get a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a lot more repression,</v>

517
00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.470
<v Speaker 3>authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not worth it.</v>

518
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's some of that also that the </v>

519
00:25:02.051 --> 00:25:02.884
<v Speaker 2>feminism movement has been a victim of </v>
<v Speaker 2>its own success in a weird way because </v>

520
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.203
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that feminist now should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be fighting so much more for women's </v>

521
00:25:10.481 --> 00:25:11.890
<v Speaker 2>rights in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

522
00:25:11.891 --> 00:25:12.724
<v Speaker 2>of course we have a long way to go here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we see all kinds of horrible </v>

523
00:25:16.151 --> 00:25:17.440
<v Speaker 2>things have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

524
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:21.340
<v Speaker 2>women still can't drive in Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of our biggest allies in the Gulf,</v>

525
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not an enemy country and all </v>

526
00:25:24.881 --> 00:25:25.714
<v Speaker 2>over the Middle East and all over Africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>where women's rights are basically </v>

527
00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:32.761
<v Speaker 2>trampled on if not nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't feminists groups focus on that</v>

528
00:25:32.771 --> 00:25:33.604
<v Speaker 2>at all?</v>

529
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:38.430
<v Speaker 3>You do have genuine patriarchal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressive societies and and what what's</v>

530
00:25:38.431 --> 00:25:43.070
<v Speaker 3>happening to women's rights in Iran is </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying of course in Saudi Arabia,</v>

531
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:43.923
<v Speaker 3>many parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been to international women's </v>

532
00:25:45.181 --> 00:25:50.160
<v Speaker 3>conferences and you meet these women who</v>
<v Speaker 3>represent when then from their countries</v>

533
00:25:50.161 --> 00:25:53.130
<v Speaker 3>that I've met from Cambodia and Yemen </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Egypt and so forth,</v>

534
00:25:53.131 --> 00:25:53.964
<v Speaker 3>and it's very inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like meeting the Elizabeth Cady </v>

535
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.833
<v Speaker 3>Stanton and Susan B Anthony that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminist foremothers of their society </v>

536
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.380
<v Speaker 3>and you would think that the know on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>campus,</v>

537
00:26:04.381 --> 00:26:07.740
<v Speaker 3>these young women would be especially </v>
<v Speaker 3>young women that are idealistic and want</v>

538
00:26:07.741 --> 00:26:08.574
<v Speaker 3>to be activists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd think they'd be making common </v>

539
00:26:10.051 --> 00:26:12.060
<v Speaker 3>cause with those women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead,</v>

540
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.420
<v Speaker 3>these women had overland and Georgetown </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

541
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.560
<v Speaker 3>they're protesting the men on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus because they and they,</v>

542
00:26:18.561 --> 00:26:20.410
<v Speaker 3>they feel they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

543
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.810
<v Speaker 3>they feel that they are like these women</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are oppressed in,</v>

544
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.400
<v Speaker 3>in Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have it as bad or worse.</v>

545
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.620
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's delusional.</v>

546
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's something much bigger</v>

547
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:33.290
<v Speaker 2>going on here and I think this is why so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of our audience,</v>

548
00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:34.124
<v Speaker 2>especially on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>likes what we're both doing and what </v>

549
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:39.040
<v Speaker 2>people like Joe Rogan a guide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sad and then Milo,</v>

550
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.043
<v Speaker 2>many others are talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some weird movement of </v>

551
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:44.184
<v Speaker 2>Authoritarians were the left now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is supposed to be about free </v>

552
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:48.564
<v Speaker 2>thinking and debating ideas and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this right where the left is now </v>

553
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.183
<v Speaker 2>throwing out half the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Sarah Haider I last week and this </v>

554
00:26:56.431 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 2>is an ex Muslim who stands up for every </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal ideal.</v>

555
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.740
<v Speaker 2>The left should love her and they shun </v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

556
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 2>At best they were actually treated worse</v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

557
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.673
<v Speaker 2>than being shunned.</v>

558
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.880
<v Speaker 3>When I wrote my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was protesting the,</v>

559
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.810
<v Speaker 3>the authoritarianism of feminism and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anti Intellectual Ism,</v>

560
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 3>the conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

561
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I expected to have a good reception from</v>

562
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:20.003
<v Speaker 3>feminist scholars because I just assumed</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a silent minority of silent </v>

563
00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:26.310
<v Speaker 3>majority of reasonable women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I did,</v>

564
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:28.120
<v Speaker 3>I heard from some great women and from </v>
<v Speaker 3>nate,</v>

565
00:27:28.121 --> 00:27:31.520
<v Speaker 3>nate [inaudible] and president of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>then president of the Acl,</v>

566
00:27:31.521 --> 00:27:32.860
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

567
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.520
<v Speaker 3>I heard from Erica Jong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

568
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:38.640
<v Speaker 3>this pro-sex feminine feminist novelist </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sober and they were great,</v>

569
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.953
<v Speaker 3>but my colleagues in the academy were </v>
<v Speaker 3>furious that I had criticized and they </v>

570
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:44.814
<v Speaker 3>thought that criticism was the same as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of betrayal and show that you were </v>

571
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.900
<v Speaker 3>on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the side of,</v>

572
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the forces of evil.</v>

573
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.860
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't just agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with you.</v>

574
00:27:55.861 --> 00:27:58.650
<v Speaker 3>They thought you were evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they don't just disagree with you,</v>

575
00:27:58.651 --> 00:28:01.170
<v Speaker 3>they think you're evil and that you give</v>
<v Speaker 3>them ptsd.</v>

576
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.153
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you give the ptsd and then it also </v>

577
00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:08.241
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give them a license to say and </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually do anything they want to you.</v>

578
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Because I could give you a zillion </v>
<v Speaker 2>examples of times where I've seen anyone</v>

579
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:13.344
<v Speaker 2>that shifts a little bit away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on the left where they are </v>

580
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 2>slandered and smeared and horrible.</v>

581
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.750
<v Speaker 3>They do to other people exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they say the right is doing.</v>

582
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.420
<v Speaker 3>They demonize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they objectify,</v>

583
00:28:25.421 --> 00:28:28.210
<v Speaker 3>they other eyes do use their word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They micro,</v>

584
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.450
<v Speaker 3>macro there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

585
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.323
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are massive macro and micro and </v>

586
00:28:32.651 --> 00:28:35.560
<v Speaker 3>nano aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they don't hesitate to be rude,</v>

587
00:28:35.561 --> 00:28:37.360
<v Speaker 3>snarky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's so much meanness.</v>

588
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand feminism with </v>
<v Speaker 3>meanness.</v>

589
00:28:40.031 --> 00:28:40.864
<v Speaker 3>It was when I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know there were some eccentric </v>

590
00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.200
<v Speaker 3>angry women from the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>second way,</v>

591
00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:50.140
<v Speaker 3>but mostly the lived experience of most </v>
<v Speaker 3>women who were enjoying their liberation</v>

592
00:28:50.141 --> 00:28:50.974
<v Speaker 3>was happiness and joy and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and being friends with men not going to </v>

593
00:28:55.361 --> 00:28:56.000
<v Speaker 3>war with them.</v>

594
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where does this strange a collusion </v>

595
00:28:59.241 --> 00:29:02.330
<v Speaker 2>of all these people that all end up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left doing this?</v>

596
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said repeatedly on the show.</v>

597
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.173
<v Speaker 2>The reason I talk about this all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and the reason I tweet about the </v>

598
00:29:07.311 --> 00:29:10.790
<v Speaker 2>regressive left and want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this because I don't want the left to go</v>

599
00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:14.240
<v Speaker 2>over the deep end and that's why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about a cross section or talking</v>

600
00:29:14.241 --> 00:29:17.840
<v Speaker 2>with a cross section of people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally all over the world because I'm</v>

601
00:29:17.841 --> 00:29:19.580
<v Speaker 2>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened to the right,</v>

602
00:29:19.581 --> 00:29:20.750
<v Speaker 2>where it went so far?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

603
00:29:20.751 --> 00:29:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is happening right now?</v>

604
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.470
<v Speaker 2>What brings these people together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think when,</v>

605
00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:27.260
<v Speaker 2>when often they shouldn't have a lot in </v>
<v Speaker 2>common?</v>

606
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.903
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

607
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:30.163
<v Speaker 3>I will tell you what I know best is </v>
<v Speaker 3>among the feminist is a small group in </v>

608
00:29:35.061 --> 00:29:39.290
<v Speaker 3>the university's gained control of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge base.</v>

609
00:29:39.291 --> 00:29:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean what we think we know about and </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

610
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.550
<v Speaker 3>So you're a journalist and you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know something about the wage gap or you</v>

611
00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:48.130
<v Speaker 3>need to know something about women and </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

612
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in education,</v>

613
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:50.494
<v Speaker 3>you go to these people and they are what</v>
<v Speaker 3>the journalist doesn't know or the </v>

614
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:53.914
<v Speaker 3>politician or the interested party </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know is that they're spinning </v>

615
00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:00.010
<v Speaker 3>and they have an ideology that drives </v>
<v Speaker 3>their research.</v>

616
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.930
<v Speaker 3>So I think a lot of people don't realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's it,</v>

617
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:09.180
<v Speaker 3>there's so much a spurious scholarship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they take it seriously and now it's,</v>

618
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 3>there are untruths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exaggerations of fic,</v>

619
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.183
<v Speaker 3>toys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>factoids that had been repeated so </v>

620
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:20.104
<v Speaker 3>often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're almost beyond the reach of </v>

621
00:30:20.771 --> 00:30:22.750
<v Speaker 3>rational analysis and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

622
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 3>and if you question them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are by definition a sexist or worse.</v>

623
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.720
<v Speaker 3>So they got a certain amount of power </v>
<v Speaker 3>just through this,</v>

624
00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this information,</v>

625
00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:37.930
<v Speaker 3>this scholarship about how in this case </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how oppressed women were.</v>

626
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.550
<v Speaker 3>So you have to sympathize and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

627
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.493
<v Speaker 3>they then kind of went off the deep end </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this psychobabble and these </v>

628
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:47.720
<v Speaker 3>psychodramas about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm triggered and you know it.</v>

629
00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.593
<v Speaker 3>I mean at Brown University they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year or so ago and there was a story </v>

630
00:30:51.671 --> 00:30:52.590
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You may have seen,</v>

631
00:30:52.591 --> 00:30:57.591
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you did in the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 3>by Judith Shulevitz at Brown University.</v>

632
00:30:57.941 --> 00:31:01.640
<v Speaker 3>They had a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a feminist feminist,</v>

633
00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.910
<v Speaker 3>actually a libertarian feminist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else,</v>

634
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.193
<v Speaker 3>another feminist debating a rape </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistics and you would think that's </v>

635
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.490
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What more could the students want?</v>

636
00:31:12.491 --> 00:31:16.470
<v Speaker 3>They can hear both sides and their sides</v>
<v Speaker 3>well represent no,</v>

637
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.840
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want the debate at all and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they formed a,</v>

638
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:19.993
<v Speaker 3>a safe room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that safe room they were playing </v>

639
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.570
<v Speaker 3>tapes of frolicking puppy dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had bubbles,</v>

640
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.110
<v Speaker 3>coloring books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>play dough.</v>

641
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I made up the Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was there.</v>

642
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.810
<v Speaker 3>So this is so infantilized and again I </v>
<v Speaker 3>and many other feminists have my agenda,</v>

643
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 3>you look at it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is infantilization,</v>

644
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.123
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the opposite of what feminism </v>

645
00:31:44.081 --> 00:31:44.914
<v Speaker 3>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I got to college we threw out </v>

646
00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:51.430
<v Speaker 3>the dorm counselors and the guardians of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our virtue and all that.</v>

647
00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:52.510
<v Speaker 3>We wanted to be in charge.</v>

648
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.910
<v Speaker 2>What went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think if there was a,</v>

649
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 2>was there a moment that it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something snapped.</v>

650
00:31:58.900 --> 00:31:59.733
<v Speaker 2>If in fact something went wrong and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist movement went from these two </v>

651
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.540
<v Speaker 2>extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think happened there?</v>

652
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

653
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.080
<v Speaker 3>I think I know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one listens to me.</v>

654
00:32:07.081 --> 00:32:10.530
<v Speaker 3>I wrote this article to the Aad beast </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I pinpointed what happened.</v>

655
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.170
<v Speaker 3>These were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'll call this,</v>

656
00:32:13.171 --> 00:32:16.320
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fainting couch.</v>

657
00:32:16.321 --> 00:32:20.310
<v Speaker 3>Feminists and purveyors of myths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They been around for a long time.</v>

658
00:32:20.311 --> 00:32:22.020
<v Speaker 3>They'd been in gender studies is too </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad,</v>

659
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:27.050
<v Speaker 3>but in 2011 at little known,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

660
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>operatic,</v>

661
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.540
<v Speaker 3>no other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no a government official center that was</v>

662
00:32:32.541 --> 00:32:35.550
<v Speaker 3>going to sound conspiratorial if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know.</v>

663
00:32:35.551 --> 00:32:36.384
<v Speaker 3>But in this case it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She sent out a letter to all the </v>

664
00:32:38.491 --> 00:32:39.770
<v Speaker 3>colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>universities,</v>

665
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 3>her name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was the assistant secretary of civil</v>

666
00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:43.430
<v Speaker 3>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russell and Ali,</v>

667
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:48.440
<v Speaker 3>and she sent out to all the colleges and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think her intention was that they take</v>

668
00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:49.274
<v Speaker 3>more seriously that women are harassed </v>
<v Speaker 3>on campus and there was too much sexual </v>

669
00:32:52.461 --> 00:32:54.350
<v Speaker 3>assault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she went overboard.</v>

670
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.303
<v Speaker 3>She's terrified the universities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>made it seem like if they didn't </v>

671
00:32:57.801 --> 00:32:58.634
<v Speaker 3>immediately put all like most men on </v>
<v Speaker 3>trial and get them out of those schools </v>

672
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:03.403
<v Speaker 3>and believe women because she claimed </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this app or this epidemic of </v>

673
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:12.070
<v Speaker 3>sexual predation that the men at at </v>
<v Speaker 3>campuses like Yale and swarthmore and so</v>

674
00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:13.790
<v Speaker 3>we're just praying on women.</v>

675
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 3>So she sent this letter and the schools </v>
<v Speaker 3>now can be sued under title nine.</v>

676
00:33:19.761 --> 00:33:23.020
<v Speaker 3>This equity statute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a wonderful statute.</v>

677
00:33:23.021 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 3>It was meant to be there to give women </v>
<v Speaker 3>equal opportunities in education,</v>

678
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.373
<v Speaker 3>but it's been twisted now and they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of declared martial law on men on </v>

679
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:31.843
<v Speaker 3>campus because of this letter was 2011 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you look at that date and then you </v>

680
00:33:35.751 --> 00:33:39.500
<v Speaker 3>see it brought words like trigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>warnings and safe space.</v>

681
00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:40.334
<v Speaker 3>This whole mindset of a rather somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>paranoid young women and their mentors </v>

682
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:46.934
<v Speaker 3>on campus it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gave them the power to to make a </v>

683
00:33:51.471 --> 00:33:54.380
<v Speaker 3>federal case literally have their </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception.</v>

684
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:55.743
<v Speaker 2>That's so interesting because I can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the line now to when you were talking </v>

685
00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.480
<v Speaker 2>about the cat calling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the slippery slope exists.</v>

686
00:34:01.481 --> 00:34:04.300
<v Speaker 2>If you were to create a law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you could be in this.</v>

687
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Well now once you have a law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they already had title nine officers,</v>

688
00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:09.874
<v Speaker 3>but since 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably the area of greatest </v>

689
00:34:12.191 --> 00:34:13.024
<v Speaker 3>growth on many campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have dozens and dozens of people </v>

690
00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.440
<v Speaker 3>monitoring how the boys are treated in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the girls at,</v>

691
00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.050
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Wesleyan,</v>

692
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.333
<v Speaker 3>in these are mostly very privileged kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of drinking and I'm </v>

693
00:34:25.091 --> 00:34:25.924
<v Speaker 3>sure drunk hookups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have redefined drunken hookups </v>

694
00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:32.370
<v Speaker 3>to at TB rape of a young man against </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

695
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.573
<v Speaker 3>So of course they call them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's a rape epidemic if you're </v>

696
00:34:35.471 --> 00:34:37.600
<v Speaker 3>going to enlarge the meaning of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible war,</v>

697
00:34:37.601 --> 00:34:40.540
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to enlarge it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>include drunken hookups.</v>

698
00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I see.</v>

699
00:34:42.991 --> 00:34:45.960
<v Speaker 2>So there's so many pieces here that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are related to feminism.</v>

700
00:34:45.961 --> 00:34:48.960
<v Speaker 2>And so much of this authoritarian stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the college stuff,</v>

701
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:50.283
<v Speaker 2>the Yale thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we were both tweeting about that </v>

702
00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.373
<v Speaker 2>happening half ago or so with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor that wrote the piece about </v>

703
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

704
00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:57.163
<v Speaker 2>the costume Halloween costumes and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see someone that's wearing saying </v>

705
00:35:00.421 --> 00:35:03.750
<v Speaker 2>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either ignore it or use your free speech</v>

706
00:35:03.751 --> 00:35:04.584
<v Speaker 2>to engage them and why you are happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it and hopefully have a </v>

707
00:35:07.351 --> 00:35:11.130
<v Speaker 2>conversation about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that professor's a husband,</v>

708
00:35:11.131 --> 00:35:11.964
<v Speaker 2>I believe is the dean there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got into this argument with the </v>

709
00:35:14.611 --> 00:35:17.760
<v Speaker 2>student and the student basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was all caught on camera,</v>

710
00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.810
<v Speaker 2>basically said this is not a place of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual ism.</v>

711
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.140
<v Speaker 2>This should be a whole home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really like.</v>

712
00:35:25.141 --> 00:35:29.610
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot to really get me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I thought this is dangerous now.</v>

713
00:35:29.611 --> 00:35:30.780
<v Speaker 2>What's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

714
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:32.460
<v Speaker 2>And I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually don't feel like a Grandpa,</v>

715
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.470
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like a grandpa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you kids.</v>

716
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Like how stupid are you kids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it really,</v>

717
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.500
<v Speaker 2>me as now we have something systemic </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have to</v>

718
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.083
<v Speaker 3>dangerous and here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some leftist I've seen or they're </v>

719
00:35:45.001 --> 00:35:46.290
<v Speaker 3>embarrassed by it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wouldn't be,</v>

720
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:47.730
<v Speaker 3>but they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

721
00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:48.990
<v Speaker 3>it's just kids acting out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

722
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:49.824
<v Speaker 3>it's not just kids acting out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are kids who have been fed a lot </v>

723
00:35:53.431 --> 00:35:54.264
<v Speaker 3>of bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy information in their ethnic </v>

724
00:35:57.151 --> 00:36:00.630
<v Speaker 3>studies or gender studies where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>highly politicized scholarship.</v>

725
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 3>They've had it and they may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they went to elite high schools,</v>

726
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:04.614
<v Speaker 3>they probably had it since 10th grade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been reading these conspiracy </v>

727
00:36:09.691 --> 00:36:10.524
<v Speaker 3>theories about how bad the United States</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a western culture and particularly </v>

728
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:15.504
<v Speaker 3>the men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's patriarchal male had Gemini so </v>

729
00:36:17.791 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 3>forth and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe it and,</v>

730
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.910
<v Speaker 3>and they do not have much knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

731
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.103
<v Speaker 3>So if they are doing things that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that know history remind you of the </v>

732
00:36:30.031 --> 00:36:30.864
<v Speaker 3>mccarthy era or even the Salem witch </v>
<v Speaker 3>trials just in terms of hysteria and </v>

733
00:36:36.121 --> 00:36:38.360
<v Speaker 3>contagions of hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

734
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.010
<v Speaker 3>they're not aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

735
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Speaker 3>and what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't happen often,</v>

736
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:44.760
<v Speaker 3>but there was one young woman that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is all over,</v>

737
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 3>not all over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can find it on the Internet.</v>

738
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:48.830
<v Speaker 3>She burned my book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gleefully,</v>

739
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:51.510
<v Speaker 3>young woman took the organs boys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>burned it and I just,</v>

740
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.610
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a teacher and a mother,</v>

741
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I just thought Bra burning a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a good history,</v>

742
00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.693
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

743
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.420
<v Speaker 2>now I assume that she tweeted it at you.</v>

744
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

745
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:06.520
<v Speaker 3>it was on tumbler and someone sent it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

746
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:09.623
<v Speaker 2>So basically they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're creating an atmosphere where </v>

747
00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 2>almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

748
00:37:13.381 --> 00:37:14.214
<v Speaker 2>it really feels 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>84 or wellbeing reverse everything is </v>

749
00:37:17.521 --> 00:37:22.440
<v Speaker 2>this sort of doublespeak and reverse of </v>
<v Speaker 2>how we're supposed to have debate,</v>

750
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.891
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

751
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 2>if you can't have an intellectual debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>in college,</v>

752
00:37:25.861 --> 00:37:27.960
<v Speaker 2>well how are you going to get out to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>real world and do it</v>

753
00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.313
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Supreme Court has ruled many </v>

754
00:37:30.611 --> 00:37:35.080
<v Speaker 3>times that freedom of speech is most </v>
<v Speaker 3>important on the college campus.</v>

755
00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:40.110
<v Speaker 3>It has refused to a Jew to sanction </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech codes and the courts have refused</v>

756
00:37:41.621 --> 00:37:42.870
<v Speaker 3>to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

757
00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.670
<v Speaker 3>but schools have them anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

758
00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:46.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

759
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.240
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

760
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.073
<v Speaker 3>if our universities become places where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be hyper protective of </v>

761
00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:53.920
<v Speaker 3>students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect them from ideas,</v>

762
00:37:53.921 --> 00:37:58.510
<v Speaker 3>and your goal is to achieve massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of comfort and safety.</v>

763
00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.510
<v Speaker 3>You have undermined the purpose of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

764
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.570
<v Speaker 3>You exist at the universities don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist for that purpose.</v>

765
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Going back to the time of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

766
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:08.140
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of socrates.</v>

767
00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:13.650
<v Speaker 3>The academy was about debate and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and counterargument and,</v>

768
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.900
<v Speaker 3>and being able to reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

769
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.460
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

770
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.410
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why people are responding</v>
<v Speaker 2>to us.</v>

771
00:38:20.411 --> 00:38:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we're trying to bring that back.</v>

772
00:38:22.481 --> 00:38:25.000
<v Speaker 2>What else do you think we can do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

773
00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:25.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

774
00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I see this stuff and I talk about it all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

775
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but every now and again I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

776
00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.920
<v Speaker 2>100 percent of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do feel a little guilty ever.</v>

777
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.320
<v Speaker 2>It's rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do once a while,</v>

778
00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:35.770
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

779
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 2>in something like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened at University of Missouri.</v>

780
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I empathize with these kids if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel,</v>

781
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were racist,</v>

782
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 2>things happening inside the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing sounds a little unclear as to</v>

783
00:38:45.251 --> 00:38:46.084
<v Speaker 2>what exactly was going on in the poop </v>
<v Speaker 2>swastikas and somebody said the n word </v>

784
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 2>and all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have no doubt that there is racism</v>

785
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:53.560
<v Speaker 2>on the campus and there's racism in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Missouri and in the country.</v>

786
00:38:53.561 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 2>I've moved out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes I do feel a little.</v>

787
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Guilty isn't the right word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a little.</v>

788
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:01.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand exactly what you're saying.</v>

789
00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:02.443
<v Speaker 3>Take it then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have never really gone on about the </v>

790
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.580
<v Speaker 3>race issues the way I do with the gender</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

791
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I think they're very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a particular history,</v>

792
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:16.100
<v Speaker 3>a very specific history with African </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans in the United States and,</v>

793
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:17.123
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't like to see the women's </v>

794
00:39:18.171 --> 00:39:22.250
<v Speaker 3>movement pretending that they're women </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been oppressed in the same way.</v>

795
00:39:22.251 --> 00:39:24.530
<v Speaker 3>That is just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depends on which women.</v>

796
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.980
<v Speaker 3>And if you were an upper middle class </v>
<v Speaker 3>white woman,</v>

797
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:28.893
<v Speaker 3>you have had a very different history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was supposedly the great </v>

798
00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:35.720
<v Speaker 3>insight of intersectional </v>
<v Speaker 3>intersectionality,</v>

799
00:39:35.721 --> 00:39:39.230
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't seem to apply it very </v>
<v Speaker 3>consistently.</v>

800
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.213
<v Speaker 3>And certain groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like most men seem to be written out of </v>

801
00:39:42.651 --> 00:39:43.640
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

802
00:39:43.641 --> 00:39:45.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just not,</v>

803
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.530
<v Speaker 3>it's not a consistent body of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need to bring in more critics,</v>

804
00:39:48.531 --> 00:39:52.460
<v Speaker 3>they need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hear from dissidents and um,</v>

805
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.470
<v Speaker 3>if they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

806
00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:55.873
<v Speaker 3>ours is a compassionate movement and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are going after people's jobs and </v>

807
00:40:00.171 --> 00:40:01.130
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are these,</v>

808
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 3>these sort of twitter mobs that want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy people's reputation.</v>

809
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:06.103
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you make of that professor at </v>

810
00:40:06.911 --> 00:40:07.744
<v Speaker 2>Missouri?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The woman who was standing there </v>

811
00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:11.870
<v Speaker 2>screaming at the reporter who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

812
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:12.763
<v Speaker 2>she was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need some muscle around here to get </v>

813
00:40:13.781 --> 00:40:14.760
<v Speaker 2>the reporter editor</v>

814
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.713
<v Speaker 3>was a thug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was thuggish and many of the little </v>

815
00:40:19.621 --> 00:40:21.940
<v Speaker 3>scenes I've seen on the campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

816
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reminiscent of a,</v>

817
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.900
<v Speaker 3>like these struggles sessions they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the cultural revolution in China.</v>

818
00:40:27.901 --> 00:40:30.100
<v Speaker 3>And those were run by students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it.</v>

819
00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:30.961
<v Speaker 3>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

820
00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:31.794
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't compare them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people we know we're throwing </v>

821
00:40:32.911 --> 00:40:35.180
<v Speaker 3>people out of windows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree that I don't,</v>

822
00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:37.590
<v Speaker 3>they're not comparable in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For one thing,</v>

823
00:40:37.591 --> 00:40:40.170
<v Speaker 3>these kids on our campus don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of power,</v>

824
00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:43.680
<v Speaker 3>thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But some that I see such as,</v>

825
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:47.340
<v Speaker 3>they seem so intoxicated with hatred and</v>
<v Speaker 3>self righteousness,</v>

826
00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:49.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they would do if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had power,</v>

827
00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:52.350
<v Speaker 3>real power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have power to hurt people,</v>

828
00:40:52.351 --> 00:40:54.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their jobs and reputations.</v>

829
00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:56.220
<v Speaker 3>But that's already awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

830
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.073
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awful what's happening to so many </v>

831
00:40:58.081 --> 00:41:00.840
<v Speaker 3>young men and I have no apologies for </v>
<v Speaker 3>criminals.</v>

832
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.730
<v Speaker 3>They're criminals on campus and taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantages of,</v>

833
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.550
<v Speaker 3>of girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awful.</v>

834
00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:10.850
<v Speaker 3>But what is more often the case with so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many that we've read about,</v>

835
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.690
<v Speaker 3>it's young men that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

836
00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:15.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a year later the girl takes a,</v>

837
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.310
<v Speaker 3>the young woman takes a women's studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>class and rethinks this bad hookup.</v>

838
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:21.383
<v Speaker 3>And then he's brought up on charges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes not even told what the </v>

839
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.420
<v Speaker 3>specifics of the charge are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had too many of those.</v>

840
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:28.763
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's what worries me is these </v>

841
00:41:30.631 --> 00:41:34.930
<v Speaker 3>people get carried away and these gender</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies and other things and then they,</v>

842
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 3>they have no regard or maybe no </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of,</v>

843
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.070
<v Speaker 3>of the first amendment of due process </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

844
00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:41.943
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of the battle that was </v>

845
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:45.470
<v Speaker 3>fought for freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

846
00:41:45.471 --> 00:41:46.304
<v Speaker 3>of course it will be turned on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're already seeing now feminists </v>

847
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:49.544
<v Speaker 3>are getting in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a professor that was </v>

848
00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:53.810
<v Speaker 3>hired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fired for using the f word.</v>

849
00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now you can see that.</v>

850
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's turning on them right now.</v>

851
00:41:57.341 --> 00:41:59.580
<v Speaker 2>You can see the left eating itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

852
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.740
<v Speaker 2>And if someone on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably shouldn't be taking that much</v>

853
00:42:02.741 --> 00:42:05.290
<v Speaker 2>joy in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because it's been so warped,</v>

854
00:42:05.291 --> 00:42:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I actually am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

855
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:08.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we've been calling them,</v>

856
00:42:08.051 --> 00:42:08.884
<v Speaker 2>the regressives I want them to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them to go the way of the </v>

857
00:42:10.841 --> 00:42:11.980
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enough of this,</v>

858
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.710
<v Speaker 3>enough of this I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we bring back it just a,</v>

859
00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.800
<v Speaker 3>an environment of openness and with </v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes.</v>

860
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there shelby jokes.</v>

861
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.590
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it?</v>

862
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Let's move away from some of the serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

863
00:42:22.741 --> 00:42:25.140
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm going to bring up Gamergate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know which way is this.</v>

864
00:42:25.141 --> 00:42:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Serious or joking will find that tragic </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

865
00:42:28.171 --> 00:42:29.004
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually I remember very much the </v>

866
00:42:30.961 --> 00:42:31.794
<v Speaker 2>first time I heard you was about a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago or so when Gamergate was just </v>

867
00:42:34.861 --> 00:42:37.470
<v Speaker 2>starting to percolate up and I tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

868
00:42:37.471 --> 00:42:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I said I want to do something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gamergate,</v>

869
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.553
<v Speaker 2>can you point me in the right direction </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I really could not get ahold of </v>

870
00:42:43.351 --> 00:42:45.330
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it seems like no one still can get</v>

871
00:42:45.331 --> 00:42:46.164
<v Speaker 2>a hold of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your name came up and Milo </v>

872
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:49.463
<v Speaker 2>Yiannopoulos and Adam Baldwin and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of other people popped up and I </v>

873
00:42:50.881 --> 00:42:51.714
<v Speaker 2>was looking around and I did one video </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it and I basically said I tried to </v>

874
00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:57.630
<v Speaker 2>lay it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I basically said I don't know what's</v>

875
00:42:57.631 --> 00:42:58.464
<v Speaker 2>going on here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since then I've had my avalon and I </v>

876
00:43:00.571 --> 00:43:02.250
<v Speaker 2>thought he did a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation.</v>

877
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.293
<v Speaker 2>You've become sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess like a heroine of the Gamergate </v>

878
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.430
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

879
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.290
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of the reasons you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing here.</v>

880
00:43:10.291 --> 00:43:12.330
<v Speaker 2>So if you were going to explain it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like two minutes,</v>

881
00:43:12.331 --> 00:43:16.950
<v Speaker 2>how would you explain the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that is Gamergate?</v>

882
00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the first thing to know.</v>

883
00:43:19.091 --> 00:43:19.924
<v Speaker 3>I am not a Gamer and in fact I've looked</v>
<v Speaker 3>at some of the games that are con and </v>

884
00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.240
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

885
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.073
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's too much violence and mayhem </v>

886
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.990
<v Speaker 3>mend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

887
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.823
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also don't like shows like </v>

888
00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.810
<v Speaker 3>breaking bad or I can't watch them too </v>
<v Speaker 3>much violence.</v>

889
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.140
<v Speaker 2>So you believe they should exist if </v>
<v Speaker 2>people sort of,</v>

890
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:34.530
<v Speaker 2>not</v>

891
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.390
<v Speaker 3>my taste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do prefer,</v>

892
00:43:36.391 --> 00:43:38.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pride and prejudice or you know,</v>

893
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:39.540
<v Speaker 3>the latest pbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

894
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Downton Abbey,</v>

895
00:43:42.061 --> 00:43:44.520
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not.</v>

896
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:45.383
<v Speaker 3>I don't impose that on everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I recognized there can be great </v>

897
00:43:47.851 --> 00:43:48.684
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alfred Hitchcock was a great director </v>

898
00:43:50.521 --> 00:43:52.410
<v Speaker 3>but I will never see psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm too afraid.</v>

899
00:43:52.411 --> 00:43:53.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

900
00:43:53.671 --> 00:43:56.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't enjoy that experience of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified in the theater,</v>

901
00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.700
<v Speaker 3>but people do it and it's theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's harmless.</v>

902
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:04.830
<v Speaker 3>And so when the video game controversy </v>
<v Speaker 3>erupted,</v>

903
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:06.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a,</v>

904
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:07.523
<v Speaker 3>I took a measure of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw some familiar players because I'd </v>

905
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.890
<v Speaker 3>been in some of these same battles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I saw that,</v>

906
00:44:13.891 --> 00:44:17.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the feminist critics were cherry</v>

907
00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:20.880
<v Speaker 3>picking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were misrepresenting and uh,</v>

908
00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.810
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

909
00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:26.810
<v Speaker 3>the gay gate was being judged by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some extreme people associated</v>

910
00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:29.310
<v Speaker 3>with it at the periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the CD,</v>

911
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 3>but like every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I mean,</v>

912
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.833
<v Speaker 3>the occupy Wall Street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were crazy people on the </v>

913
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:35.910
<v Speaker 3>periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

914
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:36.923
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and black lives matter if you go to the </v>

915
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:39.210
<v Speaker 3>periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

916
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.760
<v Speaker 3>what you should do is go to the center </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what are they saying?</v>

917
00:44:41.761 --> 00:44:44.700
<v Speaker 3>That's what I tried to do is go in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see what they were saying.</v>

918
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.350
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

919
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.393
<v Speaker 3>these critics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First you had critics who said video </v>

920
00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 3>games are causing mayhem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They create violence.</v>

921
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.130
<v Speaker 3>No one has been able to show that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And psychologists are already just tired</v>

922
00:44:56.131 --> 00:44:56.964
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

923
00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 3>forget it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not theirs.</v>

924
00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.050
<v Speaker 3>It's just going in a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one has been able to show that.</v>

925
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:01.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't.</v>

926
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:02.574
<v Speaker 2>There been some studies that have proven</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually does the reverse because </v>

927
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:05.154
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get some of their aggression out </v>

928
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:08.610
<v Speaker 2>instead of actually shooting similar.</v>

929
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.870
<v Speaker 3>And it takes a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

930
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:13.450
<v Speaker 3>no one knows what creates a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

931
00:45:13.451 --> 00:45:14.940
<v Speaker 3>a sociopath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a criminal,</v>

932
00:45:14.941 --> 00:45:17.940
<v Speaker 3>but it's probably not video games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

933
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.610
<v Speaker 3>and in previous generations they thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was comic books.</v>

934
00:45:20.611 --> 00:45:24.960
<v Speaker 3>We had a corrupting influence on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morals of the young or it was television</v>

935
00:45:24.961 --> 00:45:27.990
<v Speaker 3>and any new medium goes through this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>games seem to be there.</v>

936
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:32.880
<v Speaker 3>And then there was a feminist critics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were saying that it was causing</v>

937
00:45:32.881 --> 00:45:33.900
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

938
00:45:33.901 --> 00:45:34.734
<v Speaker 3>they were saying two things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the games themselves are sexist and </v>

939
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:41.300
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they create a attitudes of sexism.</v>

940
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:44.100
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just do not see evidence of that.</v>

941
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:48.150
<v Speaker 3>I did see that some of them had sexy </v>
<v Speaker 3>women and um,</v>

942
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.180
<v Speaker 3>but if the players like it and many of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

943
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men are known to like images of sexy </v>

944
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:55.284
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't understand why we were </v>

945
00:45:55.951 --> 00:45:56.940
<v Speaker 3>demonizing that.</v>

946
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:59.220
<v Speaker 3>And people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

947
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:00.083
<v Speaker 3>feminists will say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the male gaze looking at women's </v>

948
00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:06.480
<v Speaker 3>bodies objectifying which feminist I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a part of,</v>

949
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:11.481
<v Speaker 3>a group of feminists or libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminists who it was live and let live.</v>

950
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:12.594
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

951
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:13.973
<v Speaker 3>I'm not against people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a whole group of feminists </v>

952
00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:17.820
<v Speaker 3>that were against having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

953
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.953
<v Speaker 3>women posing in playboy or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the sports illustrated swimsuit </v>

954
00:46:24.001 --> 00:46:24.870
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of that,</v>

955
00:46:24.871 --> 00:46:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Catherine Mackinnon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrea Dworkin,</v>

956
00:46:27.391 --> 00:46:28.224
<v Speaker 3>but there was a whole group of us that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were opposed and I think we won the </v>

957
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:30.924
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently they won the assistant </v>

958
00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 3>professorships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been there ever since.</v>

959
00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 3>It's teaching these.</v>

960
00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.460
<v Speaker 2>That's all they might've won</v>

961
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.843
<v Speaker 3>if they teach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We won all the battles when they were </v>

962
00:46:42.751 --> 00:46:45.300
<v Speaker 3>the first so called culture war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We won the arguments.</v>

963
00:46:45.301 --> 00:46:47.310
<v Speaker 3>We had the New York Times on our side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had new,</v>

964
00:46:47.311 --> 00:46:51.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the media and now they've been.</v>

965
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.360
<v Speaker 3>They've been laboring away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

966
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:56.880
<v Speaker 3>with their theories and they know </v>
<v Speaker 3>relentless and now they have the backing</v>

967
00:46:56.881 --> 00:46:57.714
<v Speaker 3>of the Department of Education because </v>
<v Speaker 3>through so in the educational system </v>

968
00:47:00.451 --> 00:47:02.610
<v Speaker 3>they can make a federal case of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

969
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.863
<v Speaker 3>So it's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the end we will prevail </v>

970
00:47:05.971 --> 00:47:10.971
<v Speaker 3>because I have great faith in just human</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to see through nonsense.</v>

971
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Eventually it has to fall.</v>

972
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.353
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my question there was what is </v>

973
00:47:16.471 --> 00:47:17.304
<v Speaker 2>Gamergate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think your answer because your </v>

974
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:20.214
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had almost nothing to do with </v>

975
00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Gamergate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the right answer,</v>

976
00:47:22.021 --> 00:47:22.854
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that seems to be the confusion </v>

977
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.073
<v Speaker 2>about what is Gamergate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody seems to really understand what </v>

978
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:28.974
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at this point it's morphed into </v>

979
00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:30.950
<v Speaker 2>so many details,</v>

980
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:34.400
<v Speaker 3>so many different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the core it was a group of Gamers</v>

981
00:47:34.401 --> 00:47:36.500
<v Speaker 3>who were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were issues.</v>

982
00:47:36.501 --> 00:47:37.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a Gamer.</v>

983
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.550
<v Speaker 3>They were irritated by some cronyism in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the race.</v>

984
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.680
<v Speaker 2>The magazines were being paid off by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturer.</v>

985
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:45.543
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that was going on and that that </v>

986
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:46.810
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had,</v>

987
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.180
<v Speaker 3>we saw that in radio when it was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger medium,</v>

988
00:47:49.181 --> 00:47:51.610
<v Speaker 3>there was payola and all it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorted out.</v>

989
00:47:51.611 --> 00:47:54.230
<v Speaker 3>I think gaming had to go through that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe it still has to go,</v>

990
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:56.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's improved since Gamergate,</v>

991
00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then they also would find themselves</v>

992
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:01.091
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

993
00:48:01.091 --> 00:48:06.091
<v Speaker 3>getting attacked by game critics or </v>
<v Speaker 3>games evaluated because they objectified</v>

994
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 3>women or something and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were just thinking,</v>

995
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.970
<v Speaker 3>we just want to play our games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't really.</v>

996
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whatever.</v>

997
00:48:13.601 --> 00:48:14.434
<v Speaker 3>And then they had these critiques of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Games that were so cherry picked and </v>

998
00:48:18.971 --> 00:48:19.804
<v Speaker 3>these gamers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know their games don't mess with </v>

999
00:48:22.421 --> 00:48:23.254
<v Speaker 3>that and they know the games and then so</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were is of course Anita Sarkeesian </v>

1000
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.210
<v Speaker 3>and her videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was infuriating to.</v>

1001
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.083
<v Speaker 3>And these are some young guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainland some girls and they see their </v>

1002
00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:37.170
<v Speaker 3>games being misrepresented or she'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick a scene out,</v>

1003
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.240
<v Speaker 3>make it look like one thing and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally different or take a video.</v>

1004
00:48:40.241 --> 00:48:41.074
<v Speaker 3>No one ever watched that had you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a following of five and act as though </v>

1005
00:48:45.491 --> 00:48:48.430
<v Speaker 3>it's typical of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they knew it was cheating.</v>

1006
00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:49.264
<v Speaker 3>They knew and they got really mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what I liked about many of them is </v>

1007
00:48:52.901 --> 00:48:54.760
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fought back with arguments,</v>

1008
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:56.260
<v Speaker 3>they made videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1009
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:57.123
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was this explosion of can we get </v>

1010
00:48:58.811 --> 00:48:59.644
<v Speaker 3>acacia now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were crazy opportunists at the </v>

1011
00:49:02.591 --> 00:49:04.510
<v Speaker 3>edges or maybe they weren't even part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gamergate.</v>

1012
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Maybe no one knows who sent threats and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on both sides of the controversy.</v>

1013
00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 3>Get them.</v>

1014
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:11.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the interesting part that </v>

1015
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 2>there was this group of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's younger people playing video games.</v>

1016
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.640
<v Speaker 2>They felt that the system that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1017
00:49:18.641 --> 00:49:20.740
<v Speaker 2>they love these games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they felt that the man,</v>

1018
00:49:20.741 --> 00:49:22.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the video game manufacturers,</v>

1019
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.780
<v Speaker 2>they're buying the reviews and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it starts with that,</v>

1020
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:26.883
<v Speaker 2>but I think you just hit it that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>became this thing where suddenly this </v>

1021
00:49:28.841 --> 00:49:31.600
<v Speaker 2>group of people who have nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>common,</v>

1022
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:32.583
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what each other's skin </v>

1023
00:49:33.431 --> 00:49:36.280
<v Speaker 2>color is or sexuality is or any of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff is,</v>

1024
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:37.503
<v Speaker 2>but they all found this common thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>related to authoritarianism and they </v>

1025
00:49:41.141 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 2>fought it and that's why I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinated</v>

1026
00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:45.390
<v Speaker 3>and they fought and they fought and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1027
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.440
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1028
00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:48.030
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1029
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.470
<v Speaker 3>it may erupt again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes,</v>

1030
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.400
<v Speaker 3>it comes and goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1031
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was comradery and to two times,</v>

1032
00:49:54.451 --> 00:49:57.040
<v Speaker 3>maybe two times we've had these gamer </v>
<v Speaker 3>gate hookups where,</v>

1033
00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:58.920
<v Speaker 3>because you only know each,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a Hashtag.</v>

1034
00:49:58.921 --> 00:50:00.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not an organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1035
00:50:00.721 --> 00:50:03.060
<v Speaker 3>and in both DC and in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1036
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:07.500
<v Speaker 3>in London we had a meetup and I met the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gamers that and they weren't there.</v>

1037
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:11.580
<v Speaker 3>You can't be a more delightful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly group of people.</v>

1038
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.633
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should that be the piece that gives you </v>

1039
00:50:13.901 --> 00:50:15.820
<v Speaker 2>the hope that you were alluding to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second ago,</v>

1040
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:20.260
<v Speaker 2>that there was this group of younger </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that said we're not going to take</v>

1041
00:50:20.261 --> 00:50:22.030
<v Speaker 2>this bullshit and if they're not going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take it,</v>

1042
00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:23.070
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1043
00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1044
00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 3>it was a majority guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but lots of fantastic young women who,</v>

1045
00:50:28.101 --> 00:50:31.670
<v Speaker 3>and again these are hardcore Gamers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1046
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.580
<v Speaker 3>maybe 70 or 80 percent male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some fun.</v>

1047
00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:35.493
<v Speaker 3>The girls that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fantastic and they're part of </v>

1048
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:39.140
<v Speaker 3>that group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they even whatever they were,</v>

1049
00:50:39.141 --> 00:50:41.750
<v Speaker 3>they could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are gay women and,</v>

1050
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.450
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every race I mean is,</v>

1051
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:49.470
<v Speaker 3>it is represented and you realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>gamergate was a consumer uprising really</v>

1052
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:54.140
<v Speaker 3>from across the world across racial and </v>
<v Speaker 3>class and gender lines.</v>

1053
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:57.410
<v Speaker 3>And it was just defending a hobby they </v>
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>

1054
00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of what it is,</v>

1055
00:50:58.821 --> 00:50:59.654
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why the regressive left really </v>

1056
00:51:00.961 --> 00:51:03.090
<v Speaker 2>hated it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hated it.</v>

1057
00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:06.570
<v Speaker 2>And they wanted to get the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be a rebellion.</v>

1058
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.690
<v Speaker 2>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do not talk back to big sister,</v>

1059
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:11.123
<v Speaker 2>which is so fascinating because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was a cross section of </v>

1060
00:51:13.591 --> 00:51:14.424
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't figure out who to guilt </v>

1061
00:51:15.991 --> 00:51:20.160
<v Speaker 2>into hating who more and that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcends so many things that we see on</v>

1062
00:51:20.161 --> 00:51:23.310
<v Speaker 2>college campuses and we see in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>public discourse and free speech and all</v>

1063
00:51:23.311 --> 00:51:25.320
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For you personally,</v>

1064
00:51:25.321 --> 00:51:26.760
<v Speaker 2>how does it feel as you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

1065
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:30.150
<v Speaker 2>You were never a Gamer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet you're based mom.</v>

1066
00:51:30.151 --> 00:51:33.270
<v Speaker 2>For these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it feel to be part of something</v>

1067
00:51:33.271 --> 00:51:35.460
<v Speaker 2>that you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike feminism,</v>

1068
00:51:35.461 --> 00:51:37.860
<v Speaker 2>where you had a vested interest as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>

1069
00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:41.970
<v Speaker 2>let's say now you're part of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want to say.</v>

1070
00:51:41.971 --> 00:51:44.100
<v Speaker 2>You don't care about it because you care</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these people obviously,</v>

1071
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.330
<v Speaker 2>but as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not a Gamer,</v>

1072
00:51:45.331 --> 00:51:47.100
<v Speaker 2>but you're a leader in this thing.</v>

1073
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:52.160
<v Speaker 3>It's happened before I came to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>defensive wrestlers because they were.</v>

1074
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.533
<v Speaker 3>Our sport has been demolished by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely unnecessary interpretations </v>

1075
00:51:58.851 --> 00:51:59.684
<v Speaker 3>of this title Nine Equity Law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I made friends with a lot of </v>

1076
00:52:02.631 --> 00:52:05.690
<v Speaker 3>wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never wrestled and I've never even.</v>

1077
00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.553
<v Speaker 3>I've never even seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think except accidentally </v>

1078
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:09.760
<v Speaker 3>channel surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1079
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I love these.</v>

1080
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:13.820
<v Speaker 3>These are just great guys and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1081
00:52:13.821 --> 00:52:15.310
<v Speaker 3>and they couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1082
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have a voice in this debate.</v>

1083
00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.750
<v Speaker 3>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1084
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.093
<v Speaker 3>gender experts speak for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as if they're speaking for all women or </v>

1085
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.840
<v Speaker 3>all of the left or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They speak for themselves.</v>

1086
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.540
<v Speaker 3>People should know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how did it feel?</v>

1087
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1088
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.340
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1089
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:35.203
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because just because everyone seems </v>

1090
00:52:35.961 --> 00:52:37.160
<v Speaker 3>great and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1091
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said I haven't,</v>

1092
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.680
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of a group of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were just more diverse,</v>

1093
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:46.250
<v Speaker 3>more welcoming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good sense of humor and creative.</v>

1094
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.210
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1095
00:52:47.211 --> 00:52:50.720
<v Speaker 3>if I were to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on my knowledge of gamers over the</v>

1096
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.590
<v Speaker 3>last year or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's someone's like obsessive gaming.</v>

1097
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:57.920
<v Speaker 3>It's predictive of being an artist or an</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineer.</v>

1098
00:52:57.921 --> 00:52:58.940
<v Speaker 3>They're smart too.</v>

1099
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.983
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to play these games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've got the army and the navy </v>

1100
00:53:02.991 --> 00:53:05.790
<v Speaker 2>now playing video games to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do things.</v>

1101
00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:07.130
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1102
00:53:07.131 --> 00:53:08.970
<v Speaker 2>I was used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was running around is Mary,</v>

1103
00:53:08.971 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat mushrooms.</v>

1104
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 2>That did for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nice.</v>

1105
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:14.220
<v Speaker 2>So mushrooms in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1106
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.350
<v Speaker 2>what about online harassment because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is also a piece of this and it also</v>

1107
00:53:18.351 --> 00:53:20.650
<v Speaker 2>fits the feminism thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1108
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:24.830
<v Speaker 2>how much of it is honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of it is real?</v>

1109
00:53:24.831 --> 00:53:25.664
<v Speaker 2>There's obviously plenty of it's real </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can look on any youtube comments </v>

1110
00:53:27.901 --> 00:53:28.734
<v Speaker 2>section and then there's everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>harassing everybody for every other </v>

1111
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:36.780
<v Speaker 2>reason that it's endless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much concern should we actually have</v>

1112
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:37.614
<v Speaker 2>for this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it something that is not that </v>

1113
00:53:39.181 --> 00:53:41.170
<v Speaker 2>important because it's just words</v>

1114
00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:43.810
<v Speaker 3>digital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should have concern for a,</v>

1115
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 3>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain category of harassment.</v>

1116
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:49.680
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to make distinctions.</v>

1117
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:50.873
<v Speaker 3>If you're online and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are different people can disagree </v>

1118
00:53:54.061 --> 00:53:56.730
<v Speaker 3>with you that could upset you but you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1119
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 3>live with it and people could insult </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1120
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.310
<v Speaker 3>That's life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just unfollow them.</v>

1121
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:06.610
<v Speaker 3>Then people can be obscene and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1122
00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.513
<v Speaker 3>and it's probably more upsetting to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman than a man that kind of like </v>

1123
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:14.040
<v Speaker 3>sexual and then they can issue like </v>
<v Speaker 3>really scary threats right now obviously</v>

1124
00:54:14.041 --> 00:54:16.830
<v Speaker 3>with the really scary threats and </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the obscenity.</v>

1125
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:19.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well let's start with the threats there.</v>

1126
00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:23.340
<v Speaker 3>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to do something about that and I</v>

1127
00:54:23.341 --> 00:54:25.550
<v Speaker 3>think we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think they get reported and,</v>

1128
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.930
<v Speaker 3>and when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're credible,</v>

1129
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.460
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is with Gabria gate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1130
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:34.360
<v Speaker 3>has anybody been hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any evidence of itch?</v>

1131
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:37.680
<v Speaker 3>It's just all internet nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these,</v>

1132
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:42.150
<v Speaker 3>there are these threatening males and </v>
<v Speaker 3>making mean where are they?</v>

1133
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean were who has been hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1134
00:54:44.401 --> 00:54:46.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean the worst thing I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the worst things I read about was</v>

1135
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.860
<v Speaker 3>milo getting terrible things in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mail,</v>

1136
00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:51.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>

1137
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.980
<v Speaker 2>bomb threats called we have something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he did.</v>

1138
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:55.913
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we</v>

1139
00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.050
<v Speaker 3>did our Gamer meetup where I met the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gamers in Washington DC,</v>

1140
00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.560
<v Speaker 3>a critic of Gamergate sent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1141
00:55:03.561 --> 00:55:04.394
<v Speaker 3>he sent completely rambling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>frightening notes to the bar owner </v>

1142
00:55:08.391 --> 00:55:09.224
<v Speaker 3>telling him not to host us and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>very touching because it's borrowing or </v>

1143
00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.033
<v Speaker 3>was talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was worried that what he has this </v>

1144
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:19.580
<v Speaker 3>critic made it sound like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he was hosting some,</v>

1145
00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.473
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno some Nazis or something and the </v>

1146
00:55:24.591 --> 00:55:26.090
<v Speaker 3>bar owner said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can I do?</v>

1147
00:55:26.091 --> 00:55:28.100
<v Speaker 3>This is America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was,</v>

1148
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:30.140
<v Speaker 3>he was from Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1149
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:31.020
<v Speaker 3>rooted in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a minute,</v>

1150
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.500
<v Speaker 3>immigrant or maybe a rocky said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can I do?</v>

1151
00:55:33.501 --> 00:55:35.600
<v Speaker 3>This is America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1152
00:55:35.601 --> 00:55:37.070
<v Speaker 3>are you going to keep us out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said No.</v>

1153
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:40.010
<v Speaker 3>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were so pleased because.</v>

1154
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:40.913
<v Speaker 3>And everybody was very generous because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we felt bad that they got a bomb threat </v>

1155
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:47.300
<v Speaker 3>and the imagine making a bomb threat in </v>
<v Speaker 3>DC.</v>

1156
00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:50.780
<v Speaker 3>They brought in vans and police dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course being gamers,</v>

1157
00:55:50.781 --> 00:55:52.640
<v Speaker 3>we just went outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They partied outside.</v>

1158
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:54.420
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it had a,</v>

1159
00:55:54.421 --> 00:55:55.254
<v Speaker 2>it had a nice ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose that's all that we can do </v>

1160
00:55:57.601 --> 00:55:58.434
<v Speaker 2>is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just keep going and you just keep </v>

1161
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:00.444
<v Speaker 2>telling the truth and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which sort of gets me to my last </v>

1162
00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:02.994
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I've been trying to end all </v>

1163
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:06.560
<v Speaker 2>these interviews on the hope part of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1164
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:07.523
<v Speaker 2>Where do we go from here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With all the things we've been talking </v>

1165
00:56:09.781 --> 00:56:11.020
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1166
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:12.023
<v Speaker 2>I think you were in a piece that I owe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Milo is also in about the rise of </v>

1167
00:56:15.181 --> 00:56:16.014
<v Speaker 2>the cultural libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there is this group of people now </v>

1168
00:56:18.601 --> 00:56:19.434
<v Speaker 2>that cut across the political spectrum </v>
<v Speaker 2>that include Bill Maher and rock and </v>

1169
00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:29.581
<v Speaker 2>people on the right like Milo and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the left at that have realized we got</v>

1170
00:56:30.421 --> 00:56:34.450
<v Speaker 2>to get out of people's personal lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to stop othering everybody.</v>

1171
00:56:34.451 --> 00:56:35.284
<v Speaker 2>We got to stop judging everybody based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on color and sex and religion and all </v>

1172
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:39.214
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer that this is the </v>

1173
00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:42.754
<v Speaker 2>next political movement in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess are you with me and give me </v>

1174
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:48.574
<v Speaker 2>something else</v>

1175
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.713
<v Speaker 3>totally with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that it was my acquaintance </v>

1176
00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:52.324
<v Speaker 3>with the gamers that gave me that hope </v>
<v Speaker 3>because politically they all over the </v>

1177
00:56:54.971 --> 00:56:57.640
<v Speaker 3>spectrum but they are very libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1178
00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.313
<v Speaker 3>And this was their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they were acting and I just thought </v>

1179
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:04.660
<v Speaker 3>that it got some insight into how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were and and two,</v>

1180
00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.290
<v Speaker 3>because they are younger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're gamers are a lot,</v>

1181
00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.310
<v Speaker 3>a lot younger than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them.</v>

1182
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 3>And that gives me hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1183
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.200
<v Speaker 3>and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I like about it too is it can unite</v>

1184
00:57:14.201 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 3>us from people who were concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still a registered Democrat,</v>

1185
00:57:17.891 --> 00:57:21.430
<v Speaker 3>but out of respect for my mother and </v>
<v Speaker 3>father who are so liberal,</v>

1186
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:23.800
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't dare her register anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

1187
00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:27.790
<v Speaker 3>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can be conservative,</v>

1188
00:57:27.791 --> 00:57:28.624
<v Speaker 3>you can be liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What unites us as Americans and maybe </v>

1189
00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.990
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:38.350
<v Speaker 3>in Westerners to it is a love of </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>

1191
00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's our.</v>

1192
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:45.180
<v Speaker 3>So I think it can bring people together </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've right now it's not,</v>

1193
00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:46.163
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of the bullies have the upper </v>

1194
00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:51.760
<v Speaker 3>hand and so it's going to be a battle to</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1195
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.590
<v Speaker 3>take the power away from them and give </v>
<v Speaker 3>to where it belongs to people who just,</v>

1196
00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:56.693
<v Speaker 3>who are nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>respectful and who want a of other </v>

1197
00:57:59.981 --> 00:58:03.690
<v Speaker 3>people and realize other people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>different opinions and,</v>

1198
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:07.300
<v Speaker 3>and that that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not to be policing.</v>

1199
00:58:07.301 --> 00:58:11.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't want these authoritarians here </v>
<v Speaker 3>who said they could make the rules,</v>

1200
00:58:11.441 --> 00:58:14.240
<v Speaker 3>your arguments for censorship and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1201
00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:16.750
<v Speaker 3>and doing away with due process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to work.</v>

1202
00:58:16.751 --> 00:58:20.140
<v Speaker 3>They had been tried before with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>with unhappy results.</v>

1203
00:58:20.141 --> 00:58:22.570
<v Speaker 3>So read some history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But having said that,</v>

1204
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:26.860
<v Speaker 3>I do think and any crazy things </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening on campus right now,</v>

1205
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 3>it's maybe a good thing if people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing it and will not be so easy.</v>

1206
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:33.820
<v Speaker 3>So ready to jump on it.</v>

1207
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me,</v>

1208
00:58:35.101 --> 00:58:35.934
<v Speaker 2>that's the hope that I've been trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take for the last few weeks that even </v>

1209
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:38.813
<v Speaker 2>even in cable news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so endlessly dumb and and </v>

1210
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.880
<v Speaker 2>pandering that I was noticing people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were starting to say,</v>

1211
00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:45.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they'll cry racism every two </v>

1212
00:58:46.981 --> 00:58:49.650
<v Speaker 2>seconds and sexism and homophobia for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time.</v>

1213
00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:51.450
<v Speaker 2>They were kind of coming around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>

1214
00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:55.150
<v Speaker 2>this might be a bit much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's got to be that.</v>

1215
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:56.030
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1216
00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a good sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good time.</v>

1217
00:58:57.810 --> 00:58:58.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>

1218
00:58:58.561 --> 00:58:59.394
<v Speaker 2>Just the average person that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that not someone that's in the public </v>

1219
00:59:01.321 --> 00:59:02.154
<v Speaker 2>sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the average person that wants to do </v>

1220
00:59:04.621 --> 00:59:07.270
<v Speaker 2>something about this in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their.</v>

1221
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.800
<v Speaker 3>I would suggest that you be somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>skeptical,</v>

1222
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:14.850
<v Speaker 3>not get too carried away with a cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>until you check the facts.</v>

1223
00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've got good information and moral</v>

1224
00:59:17.401 --> 00:59:19.710
<v Speaker 3>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's moral progress.</v>

1225
00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 3>That's Martin King.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's civil rights.</v>

1226
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.310
<v Speaker 3>If you have bad information and moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>fervor,</v>

1227
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:30.410
<v Speaker 3>that's fanaticism and history is one </v>
<v Speaker 3>long lesson and the dangers of combining</v>

1228
00:59:30.411 --> 00:59:32.810
<v Speaker 3>misinformation and moral fervor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so be careful.</v>

1229
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Choose your costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>causes carefully.</v>

1230
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:37.160
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were,</v>

1231
00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:39.020
<v Speaker 3>if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'll,</v>

1232
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:40.003
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that leads to progress to being </v>

1233
00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:44.060
<v Speaker 3>careful about your causes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And right now,</v>

1234
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:46.400
<v Speaker 3>if you are a woman and you a part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus feminism,</v>

1235
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.610
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have chosen the wrong cost.</v>

1236
00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not about liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about repression.</v>

1237
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:53.181
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1238
00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 2>I look forward to seeing some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments on this one.</v>

1239
00:59:55.791 --> 00:59:57.500
<v Speaker 2>We'll see if they agree with you and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they agree,</v>

1240
00:59:57.501 --> 00:59:59.180
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have a feeling if they disagree,</v>

1241
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 2>you'll be okay with that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with that.</v>

1242
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 2>She gave me the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Persuadable.</v>
