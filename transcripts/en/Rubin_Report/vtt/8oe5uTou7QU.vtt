00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.443
<v Speaker 1>Dave rubin report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been really inspired by the </v>

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:06.024
<v Speaker 1>reaction to the interview with Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I felt really passionately </v>

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.503
<v Speaker 1>about the issues we talked about and </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to address the campaign to </v>

4
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>discredit him and I knew a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people felt the same way,</v>

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.713
<v Speaker 1>but I think I actually underestimated </v>
<v Speaker 1>just how badly people wanted this </v>

6
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:19.134
<v Speaker 1>conversation to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Youtube comments to the tweets to </v>

7
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>people who wrote me literally pages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts on facebook and email.</v>

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.663
<v Speaker 1>There was a real sense that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cathartic for people who were feeling </v>

9
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:29.484
<v Speaker 1>the same thing I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I want this show to </v>

10
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:32.244
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm really proud that we got off to </v>

11
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.524
<v Speaker 1>the right start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're going to build some kind of </v>

12
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:36.534
<v Speaker 1>community here based on the principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I laid out last week and put an </v>

13
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>action in the interview with Sam.</v>

14
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I think I have to ask something of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

15
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Many of you were giving me Kudos for </v>
<v Speaker 1>having an honest dialog,</v>

16
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>but if we really want to change things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have to be way bigger than</v>

17
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>just me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some of you know that I'm gay.</v>

18
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got gay married two weeks ago,</v>

19
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:54.474
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much the gayest thing you </v>

20
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:56.934
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really bring it up anymore </v>

21
00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:58.584
<v Speaker 1>unless it's related to something in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news and I don't want any extra credit </v>

22
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>for it or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a quality.</v>

23
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>There's still work to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>but we've done great things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving forward.</v>

25
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>That's how progress is supposed to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of years ago,</v>

26
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I hosted a podcast and a Sirius xm show </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the six pack.</v>

27
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.973
<v Speaker 1>It was a pop culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new show with celebrity guests aimed </v>

28
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>at the lgbt community.</v>

29
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.773
<v Speaker 1>The show was really different than most </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay culture out there and that it was </v>

30
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>hosted by two guys who just happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be gay,</v>

31
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't make everything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>being gay.</v>

32
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.393
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned this because we used to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>a ton of email from people saying how </v>

33
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>much we were helping them come to terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>with themselves.</v>

34
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.613
<v Speaker 1>Come out of the closet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to friends and family and all that </v>

35
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even more than that though,</v>

36
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:35.964
<v Speaker 1>we got a ton of email from people saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were still closeted and our show </v>

37
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>was there only gay outlet one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This strange paradox hit me,</v>

38
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>the people that we were helping the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>by doing the show,</v>

39
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:46.374
<v Speaker 1>the people who are closeted and had no </v>
<v Speaker 1>other outlet where the same people who </v>

40
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:50.244
<v Speaker 1>helped us as a show the least and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't tweet about us or share </v>

41
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>posts about us on facebook or even tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>their friends about us.</v>

42
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.953
<v Speaker 1>I really struggled with this in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the audience because I </v>

43
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:00.954
<v Speaker 1>knew that closeted life all too well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that if the situation had been </v>

44
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been one of those people.</v>

45
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.793
<v Speaker 1>Like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're onto something really </v>

46
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.160
<v Speaker 1>special here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be part of something that</v>

47
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>takes back liberalism for true liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to do that we have to be louder.</v>

48
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.583
<v Speaker 1>We have to be braver and bolder to save </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we think and share it with the </v>

49
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.244
<v Speaker 1>people we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed a lot of the people with the </v>

50
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:22.884
<v Speaker 1>word atheism in their usernames have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous profiles on twitter and some </v>

51
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>even on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have our reasons,</v>

52
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not passing judgment on anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

53
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.343
<v Speaker 1>but think about that for a woman in 2015</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheists are one of the last groups of </v>

54
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>people that feel like they have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous when they say what they really</v>

55
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:39.174
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>

56
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.013
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't everybody or even the </v>

57
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be a bigger portion than</v>

58
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>it should be and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

59
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:46.194
<v Speaker 1>I was closeted for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have family that won't accept </v>

60
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:49.014
<v Speaker 1>you as an atheist or maybe your </v>
<v Speaker 1>community won't or maybe you aren't </v>

61
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:52.194
<v Speaker 1>fully sure what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make this just about </v>

62
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>atheists though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all of us secular people have to</v>

63
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:57.624
<v Speaker 1>be seen and heard more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not just talk about it with each </v>

64
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:00.844
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get other people in on the </v>

65
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:02.614
<v Speaker 1>conversation too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to go out and find </v>

66
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.224
<v Speaker 1>converts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll find us because that's what </v>

67
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>humanism and secular realism does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By default,</v>

68
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>we just have to be louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be easy.</v>

69
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:12.904
<v Speaker 1>All three of the people who sam and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about who continuously </v>

70
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:16.024
<v Speaker 1>misrepresented him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done so again publicly since our </v>

71
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

72
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Feel free to check out my twitter feed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see the latest nonsense.</v>

73
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>These people are simply not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

74
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>If we want to be heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to clearly fight back with logic</v>

75
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>on our side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you hear me,</v>

76
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>if you dig what we've started here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to get bigger and better than</v>

77
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>like share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comment,</v>

78
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do whatever the hell else there is.</v>

79
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>The forces of anti-intellectualism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>radicalism are always on the march.</v>

80
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's get our voices heard so that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can win not by violence,</v>

81
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>but by ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

82
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:44.914
<v Speaker 1>as Obi wan said to luke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forest is what gives a jetta his </v>

83
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:47.734
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an energy field created by all </v>

84
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>living things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It surrounds us and penetrates us.</v>

85
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:52.714
<v Speaker 1>It binds the galaxy together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't post about it on </v>

86
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody will know.</v>

91
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>now on Al Jazeera America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most importantly she's my friend.</v>

92
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Kara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the show.</v>

93
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your resume is blowing up.</v>

94
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting kind of crazy.</v>

95
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.483
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All sciency stuff and you are my </v>

96
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>sciencey girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the Goto.</v>

97
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are my go do.</v>

98
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.733
<v Speaker 1>So I thought you'd be a perfect second </v>
<v Speaker 1>guest to have on the show because you </v>

99
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>know we had Sam Harris on last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>

100
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Scientists also assigned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 2>It's actually like really a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really a scientist like Sam.</v>

102
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Is he more of a scientist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a neuroscientist.</v>

103
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam.</v>

104
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.113
<v Speaker 2>Sam actually finished the Phd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took time off to write his first </v>

105
00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:44.144
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he actually went back and </v>

106
00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:45.494
<v Speaker 2>finished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took time off and just kept taking </v>

107
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:49.260
<v Speaker 2>time off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got the masters.</v>

108
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.450
<v Speaker 2>But you're my girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you.</v>

109
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.613
<v Speaker 2>Communicator</v>

110
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.953
<v Speaker 1>communicators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I wanted to start actually </v>

111
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.380
<v Speaker 1>because right under your name right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>it says science communicator.</v>

112
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.570
<v Speaker 1>So what is a science community?</v>

113
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>

114
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:02.244
<v Speaker 2>I think more than anything is just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>catch all term that a lot of people in </v>

115
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:09.951
<v Speaker 2>my profession you so it could mean that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you communicate science as an author,</v>

116
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're a blogger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you give talks,</v>

117
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.913
<v Speaker 2>maybe you do what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more in front of the camera </v>

118
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 2>work or even some production work behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

119
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.280
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes it takes a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalistic flare,</v>

120
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.233
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it takes more of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment flare and those are two </v>

121
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:24.414
<v Speaker 2>very different camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it all falls within that science </v>

122
00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:26.844
<v Speaker 2>communication umbrella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the main goal is to help </v>

123
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.260
<v Speaker 2>communicate scientific principles to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>

124
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.273
<v Speaker 2>help improve science literacy and do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of translation because </v>

125
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 2>sometimes scientists aren't very good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>liaising with the public.</v>

126
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they're amazing and I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

127
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they need a little bit of help</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's,</v>

128
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.850
<v Speaker 2>that's where people like I come in,</v>

129
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.763
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think sometimes people on my side </v>

130
00:05:47.301 --> 00:05:48.134
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need help and that's why I always </v>

131
00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:50.204
<v Speaker 1>bring you on to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to clean up some of the scientific </v>

132
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:54.260
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm better at English,</v>

133
00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:55.094
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you helped me clean up some of that </v>

134
00:05:55.701 --> 00:05:56.870
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously we,</v>

135
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.213
<v Speaker 1>some of our older audience that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to here have heard some of what we're </v>

136
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:01.004
<v Speaker 1>going to do here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have a whole bunch of new people </v>

137
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>that I think are going to really dig </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

138
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>So I want to get to the science stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

139
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but I wanna start with atheism because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're also my main atheist.</v>

140
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>You and Jacqueline Glenn are my two main</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist.</v>

141
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so first off,</v>

142
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.383
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we do some basic definitions </v>

143
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:16.930
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might be tough.</v>

144
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.680
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can handle the atheism.</v>

145
00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Burse agnosticism.</v>

146
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

147
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.390
<v Speaker 2>technically agnosticism is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just break down the word,</v>

148
00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it's not knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

149
00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:30.540
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people self identify as </v>
<v Speaker 2>agnostics.</v>

150
00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:33.540
<v Speaker 2>If they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if there's a greater power,</v>

151
00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:37.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what happens after you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want a hedge any bets.</v>

152
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.963
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally think that the label </v>

153
00:06:40.801 --> 00:06:45.801
<v Speaker 2>agnostic is redundant because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a theistic or theistic,</v>

154
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.390
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a believer or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonbeliever.</v>

155
00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I said this backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows if you claim to know,</v>

156
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:55.000
<v Speaker 2>like you're full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

157
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.260
<v Speaker 2>you don't know things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

158
00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:57.520
<v Speaker 2>You don't have powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have.</v>

159
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.363
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who scream about out at the </v>

160
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually seem to to know the least.</v>

161
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

162
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 2>there are some studies that confirm </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

163
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:05.114
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think of myself as an agnostic or </v>

164
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:09.634
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an atheistic agnostic and some people </v>

165
00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:12.274
<v Speaker 2>are theistic agnostics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that I don't factor God into my </v>

166
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:19.510
<v Speaker 2>daily life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I simply do not believe that God exists.</v>

167
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know if you have morals,</v>

168
00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:26.680
<v Speaker 2>if it's coming from somebody up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were two morals come from,</v>

169
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we get,</v>

170
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.570
<v Speaker 2>have morals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morals come to be a pretty moral person.</v>

171
00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:34.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty forthright person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you.</v>

172
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.190
<v Speaker 2>That's very nice of you to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

173
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.103
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

174
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.013
<v Speaker 1>but how do you navigate the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral divide if you're not getting it </v>

175
00:07:40.051 --> 00:07:41.970
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from some old book with some numbers,</v>

176
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was raised Mormon too.</v>

177
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Let's not forget that we're getting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

178
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 2>And then I left the church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not only,</v>

179
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:48.554
<v Speaker 2>I'm like more of a heathen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of the worst criminal within </v>

180
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 2>the churches viewpoint because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually accepted Jesus was baptized and</v>

181
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:55.964
<v Speaker 2>then rejected it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is way worse than never having it </v>

182
00:07:57.891 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 2>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

183
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do I get morals?</v>

184
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I get morals from literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get morals from ethics courses,</v>

185
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:06.120
<v Speaker 2>I get morals from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.483
<v Speaker 2>see I get morals from interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and looking at their struggles </v>

187
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:15.800
<v Speaker 2>and trying to put myself in people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoes and trying to understand the human</v>

188
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:16.720
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

189
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.043
<v Speaker 2>we are innately empathetic creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are innately moral creatures and the </v>

190
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:29.450
<v Speaker 2>more that we can kind of embrace others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more that we can try to,</v>

191
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:30.284
<v Speaker 2>I think remove the US them paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also very human and it's also </v>

192
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:38.120
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to push past.</v>

193
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.133
<v Speaker 2>But the more that we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the more that we can live these </v>

194
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:43.214
<v Speaker 2>moral lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people want to say that </v>

195
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:49.610
<v Speaker 2>morality is sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

196
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.343
<v Speaker 2>an outcome of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps a religion is an outcome of </v>

197
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 2>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

198
00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:00.030
<v Speaker 2>there are correlations between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as I often say,</v>

199
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correlation does not imply causality.</v>

200
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.703
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to prove that without </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion we wouldn't have or that you </v>

201
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

202
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without religion we wouldn't have a </v>

203
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 2>moral compass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually pretty philosophically</v>

204
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 2>ludicrous to sink in those terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

205
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are from Texas,</v>

206
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 2>as you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you grew up Mormon.</v>

207
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 2>So in the Mormon church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did you come out as atheist?</v>

208
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I'm remembering correctly,</v>

209
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I came out when I was around 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>old and it was like coming out.</v>

210
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did the idea of general care,</v>

211
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.263
<v Speaker 2>how did she feel about like actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to say this thing and that's the </v>

212
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:39.894
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had to say it because I </v>

213
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:41.514
<v Speaker 2>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't grow up in kind of a sort of </v>

214
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.124
<v Speaker 2>religious household.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a very traditional Mormon </v>

215
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 2>household.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

216
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.023
<v Speaker 2>I remember telling my father I had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>questioning for awhile and he had been </v>

217
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Speaker 2>given me kind of the pat responses of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

218
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pray about it and whatever.</v>

219
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.353
<v Speaker 2>You'll figure it out on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I would pray about it and </v>

220
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:00.990
<v Speaker 2>nothing would happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I was like,</v>

221
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finally remember telling my father,</v>

222
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe I don't believe,</v>

223
00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like I'm lying myself going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to church every Sunday,</v>

224
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:09.924
<v Speaker 2>every Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day before school going to </v>

225
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 2>seminary.</v>

226
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.230
<v Speaker 2>It was a huge part of my life and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt like a big ruse.</v>

227
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:17.064
<v Speaker 2>I think much like somebody who is in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>closet and who is struggling trying to </v>

228
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:24.110
<v Speaker 2>act straight or trying to be somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not.</v>

229
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 2>And so I remember telling him and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember these words,</v>

230
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.233
<v Speaker 2>as long as you live under my roof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a moral obligation to God to </v>

231
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:36.450
<v Speaker 2>force you to go to church until you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>18 years old.</v>

232
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do with that?</v>

233
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.620
<v Speaker 2>As a 15 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't live under his roof anymore.</v>

234
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.210
<v Speaker 2>So it was a big choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

235
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:46.650
<v Speaker 2>my parents had long been divorced and at</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 I remember saying to him,</v>

236
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technically I think I'm of an age of </v>

237
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:50.184
<v Speaker 2>consent where if we went to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>courthouse and I pled my case that a </v>

238
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:56.550
<v Speaker 2>judge would say she can stay with her </v>
<v Speaker 2>mom full time.</v>

239
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 2>It's her choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

240
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's old enough to make these kinds of </v>

241
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.880
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was a pretty precocious kid.</v>

242
00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:03.714
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I could have convinced the </v>
<v Speaker 2>judge that I had thought about this </v>

243
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I had.</v>

244
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 2>And so my father said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

245
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:10.374
<v Speaker 2>he let me make that choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a difficult bind to be in and I </v>

246
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 2>didn't talk to him for many years after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

247
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Our relationship took a big hit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

248
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 2>it took a long time for us to get back </v>
<v Speaker 2>on good terms.</v>

249
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:21.803
<v Speaker 2>So there's two really different but </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting pieces to that because </v>

250
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:28.770
<v Speaker 2>there's the choice that you made in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own life to say this is who I am,</v>

251
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 2>but then there's this other piece of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy for it,</v>

252
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.790
<v Speaker 2>for a 40 year old to say to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>

253
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in what you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much less a 15 year old.</v>

254
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.283
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's even easier for 15 year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're like rebellious at that </v>

255
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 2>point anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

256
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:42.084
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that definitely I look back at the </v>

257
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 2>gravity of that decision and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

258
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was pretty bold of me.</v>

259
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.513
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if I felt that way at the </v>

260
00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you separate.</v>

261
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we talked Sam about</v>

262
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.903
<v Speaker 1>a lot with separating the doctrine of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something from the people that follow </v>

263
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:00.501
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the case we,</v>

264
00:12:00.501 --> 00:12:01.334
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was mostly about the doctrine of </v>

265
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Islam versus Muslim people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you now,</v>

266
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:06.094
<v Speaker 1>after the experience that you had with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your father believing what you believe </v>

267
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.130
<v Speaker 1>your whole career really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very much based in this.</v>

268
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 1>How do you separate the doctrine of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mormonism?</v>

269
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:15.274
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have many other family </v>
<v Speaker 1>members that you love that are great </v>

270
00:12:16.811 --> 00:12:17.644
<v Speaker 1>people and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you separate that from the piece </v>

271
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:22.300
<v Speaker 1>of you that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't believe in any of this?</v>

272
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:23.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's for me,</v>

274
00:12:25.091 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to separate for my own life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

275
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.113
<v Speaker 2>Like I can look at mormonism and I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at my beliefs and I can say that's </v>

276
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:31.474
<v Speaker 2>bullshit and I don't believe in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course there are people that I </v>

277
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:35.820
<v Speaker 2>love who are like hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>line and sinker.</v>

278
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 2>They buy into it and it's one thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>step back and say,</v>

279
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:41.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bought into bullshit,</v>

280
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's another thing to actually say </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd still respect these people in there.</v>

281
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:45.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

282
00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

283
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I come from Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't come from like rednecks.</v>

284
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother who is no longer more men,</v>

285
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 2>is an educator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a school teacher.</v>

286
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Recently retired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father,</v>

287
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Speaker 2>who still is very much mormon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an engineer and his wife who was also</v>

288
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 2>very much warman is a science teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very good science teacher.</v>

289
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.983
<v Speaker 2>And so these are educated people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>promote education and who are very good </v>

290
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:11.860
<v Speaker 2>parents adopted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

291
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 2>adult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Adult,</v>

292
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:14.164
<v Speaker 2>but teenage children after we had moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the house like incredible people </v>

293
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.053
<v Speaker 2>and I love them dearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have a big disconnect when it </v>

294
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:23.374
<v Speaker 2>comes to belief now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they need to believe what </v>

295
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I believe for us to get along and vice </v>
<v Speaker 2>versa.</v>

296
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.190
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing when you're in a parental</v>
<v Speaker 2>child situation,</v>

297
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.180
<v Speaker 2>the rules are a bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

298
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.363
<v Speaker 2>but it is still tough because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you take with </v>

299
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:36.124
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how long after the </v>

300
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:42.670
<v Speaker 2>reconciliation happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a bit of pity.</v>

301
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 2>A bit of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

302
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.573
<v Speaker 2>I know in my heart of hearts that I kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of feel sorry that they lived this </v>

303
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:50.590
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel sorry for them,</v>

304
00:13:50.591 --> 00:13:54.070
<v Speaker 2>that they're sort of enslaved to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious rules.</v>

305
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.083
<v Speaker 2>I feel sorry for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have to struggle with big </v>

306
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 2>issues like accepting homosexuality in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the family,</v>

307
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:03.123
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their church teaches them that this </v>

308
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 2>is an abomination and it's so ingrained </v>
<v Speaker 2>in them.</v>

309
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.810
<v Speaker 2>But I know they must struggle feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

310
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 2>but I love this person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could that person be an abomination?</v>

311
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.123
<v Speaker 2>Those I feel sorry for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the completely religiously inundated </v>

312
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.620
<v Speaker 2>that they have to do that</v>

313
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.210
<v Speaker 1>pity for you to like they would look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and go,</v>

314
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.343
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't have these incredibly </v>

315
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:27.570
<v Speaker 1>powerful beliefs.</v>

316
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad thinks I'm not going to heaven.</v>

317
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

318
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.131
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

319
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:33.964
<v Speaker 2>And not especially not the celestial and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the terrestrial in heaven gets super </v>

320
00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:39.090
<v Speaker 2>complicated in the Mormon faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

321
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.933
<v Speaker 2>of course you feel sorry for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks I'm not going to bathe in </v>

322
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:42.694
<v Speaker 2>God's glory for all of eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a pretty big deal to </v>

323
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:48.610
<v Speaker 2>somebody who actually believes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist and you're not doing that</v>

324
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.400
<v Speaker 1>just as a private person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it as well.</v>

325
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very publicly</v>

326
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.083
<v Speaker 1>and interacting with a lot of people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially influencing people and you </v>

327
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

328
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm a heretic and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

329
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.750
<v Speaker 1>probably not something he's very proud </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

330
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.743
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think atheists are so hated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen poll after poll and we've </v>

331
00:15:07.591 --> 00:15:08.424
<v Speaker 1>talked about them in some other shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that atheists are the most distrusted </v>

332
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.710
<v Speaker 1>group in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

333
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.470
<v Speaker 1>people would never vote for an atheist </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be president.</v>

334
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

335
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Barney frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who came,</v>

336
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.060
<v Speaker 1>who was a congressman from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts,</v>

337
00:15:21.061 --> 00:15:21.894
<v Speaker 1>a pretty liberal place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out as gay and something like 1983 </v>

338
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.103
<v Speaker 1>didn't come out as an atheist until he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on real time with Bill Maher after </v>

339
00:15:28.051 --> 00:15:28.884
<v Speaker 1>he had retired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since then has even backtrack a </v>

340
00:15:30.901 --> 00:15:32.940
<v Speaker 1>little bit on saying that he was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist.</v>

341
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.163
<v Speaker 1>What is it about atheist because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist that I know are pretty much by </v>

342
00:15:37.951 --> 00:15:42.000
<v Speaker 1>and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most decent sort of humanistic,</v>

343
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.033
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open people that I know and yet there's </v>

344
00:15:45.241 --> 00:15:46.920
<v Speaker 1>this portrayal of them that's completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

345
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that atheists have horns or anything,</v>

346
00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:51.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

347
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

348
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.083
<v Speaker 2>there's racism and xenophobia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's hate and there's fear and </v>

349
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:56.894
<v Speaker 2>there's all of the different things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed into why people don't trust or </v>

350
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:03.494
<v Speaker 2>don't like what they don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think specifically though with </v>

351
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:11.270
<v Speaker 2>atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to put yourself in the shoes of</v>

352
00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:12.104
<v Speaker 2>the religious to understand where this </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred comes from because of course </v>

353
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.033
<v Speaker 2>nonreligious people don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with religious people running </v>

354
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:21.970
<v Speaker 2>for office office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's religious people from.</v>

355
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.611
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonreligious.</v>

356
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:24.680
<v Speaker 2>People don't have any problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheists running for office.</v>

357
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.910
<v Speaker 2>It's religious people that have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with that and think about,</v>

358
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:30.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>

359
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.603
<v Speaker 2>you're an upstanding gay man and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are moments when you have your moments </v>

360
00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:38.370
<v Speaker 2>and there are some religious people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that you are just Yuck,</v>

361
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

362
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Who think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like being gay is disgusting like Edward</v>

363
00:16:42.531 --> 00:16:43.364
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] book because that's what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible teaches and so they have these </v>

364
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:49.180
<v Speaker 2>ideas in their head that your lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 2>is an abomination and blah,</v>

365
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:49.491
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

366
00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 2>and it is a choice and you could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>chosen to live another way,</v>

367
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:53.683
<v Speaker 2>but you're still a person and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>flawed person and you've made a </v>

368
00:16:56.691 --> 00:16:59.060
<v Speaker 2>difficult choice and maybe you can come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back around.</v>

369
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.403
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really speaks to the core of the </v>

370
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:04.004
<v Speaker 2>structure of belief that an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as somebody who actively rejects the </v>

371
00:17:07.671 --> 00:17:08.504
<v Speaker 2>foundation of what matters to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and and that act is so closely </v>

372
00:17:14.631 --> 00:17:19.631
<v Speaker 2>tied to what they think of as the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they think of as evil,</v>

373
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 2>what they think of as heresy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these pure,</v>

374
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.080
<v Speaker 2>just irrationally fearful states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's apostasy.</v>

375
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.480
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what fuels Isis,</v>

376
00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:32.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

377
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.613
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worse than being a and Islamic </v>

378
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.663
<v Speaker 2>apostate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worse than being a Christian </v>

379
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:41.330
<v Speaker 2>apostate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's being an atheist,</v>

380
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the ultimate.</v>

381
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.363
<v Speaker 2>It's the ultimate apostasy and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's really where it comes from </v>

382
00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 2>and because of that historically </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation generation,</v>

383
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.873
<v Speaker 2>I think we get a bad rap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got some people who are such </v>

384
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:53.724
<v Speaker 2>deep believers that there's no way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come around to it and </v>

385
00:17:55.501 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Speaker 2>then you've got other people who just </v>
<v Speaker 2>equate the word atheism with like,</v>

386
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like bad stuff.</v>

387
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Like they're criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

388
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.990
<v Speaker 2>they're just like bad dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

389
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.370
<v Speaker 2>So I want to get</v>

390
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.300
<v Speaker 1>the new atheism.</v>

391
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

392
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the other piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is?</v>

393
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:09.864
<v Speaker 1>That to me it seems like because an </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist can come from any religious </v>

394
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:13.910
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be any sex,</v>

395
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 1>but sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any nationality,</v>

396
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:16.643
<v Speaker 1>all of those things that in a weird way </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they fear is that this group of </v>

397
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:24.360
<v Speaker 1>people is coming together using sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best of all of us.</v>

398
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they like that.</v>

399
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.083
<v Speaker 1>They think that it's sorta like for gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>people there are gay people of every </v>

400
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Speaker 1>nationality and ethnicity and religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that,</v>

401
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.603
<v Speaker 1>and that's why there's so much richness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the gay community and I'm </v>

402
00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:35.394
<v Speaker 1>starting to think that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people fear about atheists to because </v>

403
00:18:37.861 --> 00:18:39.180
<v Speaker 1>there's black atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white atheist,</v>

404
00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:40.014
<v Speaker 1>atheist.</v>

405
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that I think intrinsic</v>

406
00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.350
<v Speaker 2>in what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gay community,</v>

407
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.100
<v Speaker 2>like the atheist community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it exists.</v>

408
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:49.863
<v Speaker 2>It exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not to the same extent because I </v>

409
00:18:51.161 --> 00:18:51.994
<v Speaker 2>think there's something that's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental to being an atheist that </v>

410
00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.490
<v Speaker 2>makes some people reject trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

411
00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.440
<v Speaker 2>The whole point is that we're not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>church.</v>

412
00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:05.350
<v Speaker 2>The whole point is that we just don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

413
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.213
<v Speaker 2>It's not that we all believed the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is that we have a lack of belief </v>

414
00:19:08.741 --> 00:19:09.574
<v Speaker 2>and I think that by definition that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes some people feel like we don't </v>

415
00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:14.980
<v Speaker 2>need to band together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no common thread here.</v>

416
00:19:14.981 --> 00:19:16.540
<v Speaker 2>It's just the default state.</v>

417
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.383
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's exactly where I wanted to go </v>

418
00:19:18.321 --> 00:19:21.110
<v Speaker 1>with this because new atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be the new thing.</v>

419
00:19:21.111 --> 00:19:22.970
<v Speaker 1>So do you have a definition for new </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist?</v>

420
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can sort of tell you what I think,</v>

421
00:19:25.041 --> 00:19:25.380
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

422
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think the new atheist is a term</v>

423
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 2>that's often used by non new atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's sort of a derogatory term.</v>

424
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:32.964
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not really sure how to define it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it seems like from the outside </v>

425
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:37.470
<v Speaker 2>people apply that label.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

426
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm a new atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

427
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.893
<v Speaker 2>I do know that the term firebrand </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist is one that's actually kind of </v>

428
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:46.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome within that community.</v>

429
00:19:46.591 --> 00:19:49.140
<v Speaker 2>So David Silverman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was president of American atheist,</v>

430
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.123
<v Speaker 2>he has a new book coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually wrote the foreword to his </v>

431
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:52.434
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really funny because he's a </v>

432
00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:57.360
<v Speaker 2>hardcore firebrand atheist and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

433
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.870
<v Speaker 2>But I liked that he is one because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it takes all types.</v>

434
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:01.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

435
00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Firebrand though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean like really outspoken?</v>

436
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.903
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't think you can be an </v>

437
00:20:05.391 --> 00:20:06.370
<v Speaker 2>atheist Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

438
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.363
<v Speaker 2>Like he thinks you need to drop the </v>
<v Speaker 2>juice I because how can you be both an </v>

439
00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:11.570
<v Speaker 2>atheist energy or you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

440
00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.600
<v Speaker 2>hold onto your atheist values and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be very open about it.</v>

441
00:20:14.601 --> 00:20:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Like we talked about this at length on </v>
<v Speaker 2>my podcast and I'm like,</v>

442
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.650
<v Speaker 2>of course you can be an atheist,</v>

443
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the one of the biggest alias.</v>

444
00:20:21.171 --> 00:20:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that barely makes any sense.</v>

445
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.660
<v Speaker 2>So aps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't believe in God,</v>

446
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.113
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of my best friends is an </v>

447
00:20:28.991 --> 00:20:33.430
<v Speaker 2>atheist Jew and I get it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's Super Jewish and super atheist.</v>

448
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm not a firebrand atheist.</v>

449
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I am really kind of accepting of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's religious beliefs.</v>

450
00:20:41.021 --> 00:20:41.854
<v Speaker 2>And I think that we need a spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 2>more secular values if we want to move </v>

451
00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:46.444
<v Speaker 2>the goalpost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's important that there </v>

452
00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:48.994
<v Speaker 2>are firebrand atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same way that I think that it's </v>

453
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:51.940
<v Speaker 2>important that when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism,</v>

454
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 2>that there are men who hold onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist ideals,</v>

455
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.553
<v Speaker 2>that there are women who are out loud </v>
<v Speaker 2>and proud and in front of the line </v>

456
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:00.334
<v Speaker 2>talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there are women who act in a </v>

457
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:03.784
<v Speaker 2>feminist way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who don't make it their mission to </v>

458
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:09.820
<v Speaker 2>always be that feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with black lives matter.</v>

459
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:10.953
<v Speaker 2>Across the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need the people that are out in </v>

460
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:15.400
<v Speaker 2>front that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are being loud,</v>

461
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.860
<v Speaker 2>that are making sure that people pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to this movement,</v>

462
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.850
<v Speaker 2>but you also need the people who quietly</v>
<v Speaker 2>live their lives that way every day.</v>

463
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we should have a broad </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum of different things and can all</v>

464
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:28.720
<v Speaker 2>still get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And exactly and the truth is if you have</v>

465
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.180
<v Speaker 2>atheists have all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>flavors,</v>

466
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.930
<v Speaker 2>then I think that you're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>more people being affected.</v>

467
00:21:34.931 --> 00:21:39.070
<v Speaker 2>More people that are afraid to come out </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that person is just like me.</v>

468
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Or I see myself in that person and I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at them as a role model.</v>

469
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.480
<v Speaker 2>If we were all one flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would turn off a huge section of the</v>

470
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.733
<v Speaker 1>and I think to sort of wrap this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's sort of the people that </v>

471
00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:51.744
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately it happens to be a lot of </v>

472
00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:55.000
<v Speaker 1>people on the left that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking new atheist.</v>

473
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.450
<v Speaker 1>My friend Kyle Kalinsky said that a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist to him,</v>

474
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:58.463
<v Speaker 1>it's just an atheist that finally saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an atheist because atheist used to </v>

475
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.180
<v Speaker 1>have to just not say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

476
00:22:03.181 --> 00:22:06.570
<v Speaker 1>And when I see these people on the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking new atheist as if new atheists</v>

477
00:22:06.571 --> 00:22:07.404
<v Speaker 1>have some set of beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they have is this one thing in </v>

478
00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.630
<v Speaker 1>common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not belief,</v>

479
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.570
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a bigger sense.</v>

480
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:13.211
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

481
00:22:13.211 --> 00:22:14.044
<v Speaker 2>I remember dating somebody a previously </v>
<v Speaker 2>who I think was a little confused about </v>

482
00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:19.204
<v Speaker 2>my atheism but was probably agnostic </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself and I remember him saying </v>

483
00:22:23.171 --> 00:22:24.004
<v Speaker 2>something about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand why you have to </v>

484
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:27.130
<v Speaker 2>be so public about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

485
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a private matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you always.</v>

486
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.480
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a double standard.</v>

487
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding me?</v>

488
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Religious people are like the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>public people about their religion.</v>

489
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.840
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that I want to say vocally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an atheist,</v>

490
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.733
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't factor God into my decision </v>

491
00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:46.090
<v Speaker 2>making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in any afterlife.</v>

492
00:22:46.091 --> 00:22:47.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>supernatural.</v>

493
00:22:47.651 --> 00:22:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm a science based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence based thinker.</v>

494
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.763
<v Speaker 2>The reason I do that is because then if </v>
<v Speaker 2>I continue to live my life the way that </v>

495
00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:57.160
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm living in a moral way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an upstanding way,</v>

496
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.320
<v Speaker 2>then people can look and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

497
00:22:59.321 --> 00:23:01.810
<v Speaker 2>that's what an atheist looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

498
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.903
<v Speaker 1>I've been really inspired the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks and I've been noticing </v>

499
00:23:04.651 --> 00:23:06.600
<v Speaker 1>this over probably about six months or </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

500
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I sense a real awakening by secular </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

501
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:11.483
<v Speaker 1>not just atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people that are secular and that </v>

502
00:23:13.321 --> 00:23:14.820
<v Speaker 1>they can have whatever belief that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

503
00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:17.610
<v Speaker 1>but they want our public space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our politics,</v>

504
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:21.390
<v Speaker 1>and our public life to have nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with religion.</v>

505
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you sense this?</v>

506
00:23:23.011 --> 00:23:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Please tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

507
00:23:24.691 --> 00:23:26.490
<v Speaker 1>That there's been some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>awakening.</v>

508
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.373
<v Speaker 2>So like constitutionalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like people who are coming back </v>

509
00:23:31.641 --> 00:23:35.030
<v Speaker 2>around to 250 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

510
00:23:35.031 --> 00:23:35.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think so.</v>

511
00:23:35.991 --> 00:23:36.824
<v Speaker 2>I think that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does come from more people being </v>

512
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.960
<v Speaker 2>willing to say that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonreligious.</v>

513
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.823
<v Speaker 2>It's the largest growing minority in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country and even though people who self </v>

514
00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:47.354
<v Speaker 2>identify as atheist or shield though </v>
<v Speaker 2>most hated group and trusted less than </v>

515
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:52.520
<v Speaker 2>rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just totally crazy.</v>

516
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.043
<v Speaker 2>People who are not religious are growing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in numbers and I think they're growing </v>

517
00:23:58.251 --> 00:23:59.084
<v Speaker 2>in solidarity and even religious people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are saying are standing up for a </v>

518
00:24:04.371 --> 00:24:05.204
<v Speaker 2>secular values and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to promote a separation of </v>

519
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:12.170
<v Speaker 2>church and state and we need to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the Christian privilege.</v>

520
00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:16.340
<v Speaker 2>That is underlied our political </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure for way too long now.</v>

521
00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Does it always strike you as odd that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me the religious right.</v>

522
00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:20.824
<v Speaker 1>On one hand they always scream about </v>
<v Speaker 1>separation of church and state and then </v>

523
00:24:24.121 --> 00:24:28.150
<v Speaker 1>they're the same ones that are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing religion into the conversation.</v>

524
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Did it really scream of etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they do.</v>

525
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to listen to them very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

526
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.193
<v Speaker 1>You something real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like kim davis and huckabee </v>

527
00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.103
<v Speaker 1>where he was telling people that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't abide by a law that she </v>

528
00:24:40.051 --> 00:24:41.040
<v Speaker 1>doesn't believe in.</v>

529
00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that</v>

530
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.190
<v Speaker 1>combining church and state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was given them a little bit.</v>

531
00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Just a quick aside with this whole kim </v>
<v Speaker 2>davis,</v>

532
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.013
<v Speaker 2>why do people care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like this is like the plane </v>

533
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 2>crash over and over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

534
00:24:57.231 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Like this has really no bearing on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>

535
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.300
<v Speaker 2>this one woman is emblematic of how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>this movement is dying.</v>

536
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.553
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's only one person </v>

537
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 2>that they can point to and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's rallying around her and it's</v>

538
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:12.554
<v Speaker 2>a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become such an eye roll and it to </v>

539
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:16.514
<v Speaker 2>me it's actually a good thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's showing me that it's becoming more </v>

540
00:25:20.121 --> 00:25:22.940
<v Speaker 2>and more marginalized and we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take them serious.</v>

541
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

542
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.353
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've sent two tweets on the </v>

543
00:25:26.011 --> 00:25:26.844
<v Speaker 1>whole kim davis thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which normally it would be like one of </v>

544
00:25:28.081 --> 00:25:28.914
<v Speaker 1>my wheel house thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me it's like we've won </v>

545
00:25:31.081 --> 00:25:32.360
<v Speaker 1>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've won,</v>

546
00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.393
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that mike huckabee can </v>

547
00:25:34.681 --> 00:25:38.880
<v Speaker 1>do to reverse this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if god forbid he became president.</v>

548
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I say that with you already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won't</v>

549
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.273
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's doubling down on a nonissue </v>

550
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:51.120
<v Speaker 2>that's embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's laughable and I think that the</v>

551
00:25:51.671 --> 00:25:56.671
<v Speaker 2>more that we put her in the spotlight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the more that we do the wall to wall</v>

552
00:25:57.461 --> 00:25:58.294
<v Speaker 2>cnn coverage about her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more it gives this false sense of </v>

553
00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:02.560
<v Speaker 2>legitimacy that just doesn't exist.</v>

554
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.543
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the media is blowing it up to </v>

555
00:26:04.511 --> 00:26:06.850
<v Speaker 1>be this thing where actuallY the average</v>
<v Speaker 1>person is like,</v>

556
00:26:06.851 --> 00:26:07.631
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

557
00:26:07.631 --> 00:26:09.320
<v Speaker 1>this is a dying dinosaur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

558
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is.</v>

559
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.460
<v Speaker 2>She's a monologue joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all she is.</v>

560
00:26:12.461 --> 00:26:13.294
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

561
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.810
<v Speaker 1>So one more on this sort of broad topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

562
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:16.520
<v Speaker 1>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

563
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.353
<v Speaker 1>I had sam on last week and it's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting for me to see what </v>

564
00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:25.781
<v Speaker 1>happens when someone with a background </v>
<v Speaker 1>in science gets involved in politics.</v>

565
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.690
<v Speaker 1>And I almost think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have one critique of sam,</v>

566
00:26:29.691 --> 00:26:30.524
<v Speaker 1>it would be that he's placed himself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this really precarious position out of </v>

567
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:35.210
<v Speaker 1>his own bravery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as he said,</v>

568
00:26:35.211 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 1>it was at huge cost to him probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally and professionally,</v>

569
00:26:38.811 --> 00:26:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

570
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.233
<v Speaker 1>do you think it's hard for scientists or</v>
<v Speaker 1>should people have a science background </v>

571
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:48.220
<v Speaker 1>get involved in the political debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems he's two.</v>

572
00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:49.123
<v Speaker 1>He in a lot of wayS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's too smart to be talking about the </v>

573
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:54.840
<v Speaker 1>way we talk about politics because </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics is so dumbed down.</v>

574
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.003
<v Speaker 1>I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump is leading in the </v>

575
00:26:57.271 --> 00:26:58.030
<v Speaker 1>republican party</v>

576
00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:59.310
<v Speaker 2>and it's a binary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

577
00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.390
<v Speaker 2>There's no room for nuance and political</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>

578
00:27:01.391 --> 00:27:02.224
<v Speaker 2>especially not in the eight second sound</v>
<v Speaker 2>bytes that we've grown use to and </v>

579
00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.970
<v Speaker 2>political media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

580
00:27:06.971 --> 00:27:07.804
<v Speaker 2>I'm of two minds about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I am a cohost on the sKeptic's guide </v>

581
00:27:11.801 --> 00:27:14.890
<v Speaker 2>to the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a popular science podcasts that</v>

582
00:27:14.891 --> 00:27:18.340
<v Speaker 2>really celebrates skepticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eviDenced based thinking,</v>

583
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.880
<v Speaker 2>debunking medical quackery and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

584
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.430
<v Speaker 2>And the host,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steven novella is,</v>

585
00:27:24.431 --> 00:27:26.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a renowned neuroscientist and a renowned</v>

586
00:27:26.831 --> 00:27:27.664
<v Speaker 2>skeptic and He has an edit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has made an editorial decision on </v>

587
00:27:30.881 --> 00:27:34.180
<v Speaker 2>this show over the past 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just joined like two months ago,</v>

588
00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.373
<v Speaker 2>that we don't discuss politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's not relevant to the </v>

589
00:27:38.351 --> 00:27:40.960
<v Speaker 2>scientific conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now on my podcast,</v>

590
00:27:40.961 --> 00:27:45.961
<v Speaker 2>I talk about politics all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think that science is not just</v>

591
00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:46.953
<v Speaker 2>a topic that you study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just facts and figures in a </v>

592
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:50.443
<v Speaker 2>textbook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a way of thinking and it's a </v>

593
00:27:53.621 --> 00:27:54.454
<v Speaker 2>way of utilizing the principles of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific method and looking at </v>

594
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.780
<v Speaker 2>evidence in order to make informed </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>

595
00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.900
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific thinking is the foundation of</v>

596
00:28:04.901 --> 00:28:08.500
<v Speaker 2>politics and if we could start moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

597
00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:09.883
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into kind of a direction where this </v>

598
00:28:12.011 --> 00:28:12.844
<v Speaker 2>country is governed based on evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not based on as cold bear calls it </v>

599
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.690
<v Speaker 2>truthiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so often what we do.</v>

600
00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.450
<v Speaker 2>Legislation passed because it gives you </v>
<v Speaker 2>a gut check,</v>

601
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or because there's pork or you know,</v>

602
00:28:24.341 --> 00:28:25.174
<v Speaker 2>all those other reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial incentives and things like </v>

603
00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:28.414
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so often we make strong legislative </v>

604
00:28:30.821 --> 00:28:31.654
<v Speaker 2>decisions where there is evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>available to us and we don't base it on </v>

605
00:28:35.321 --> 00:28:36.154
<v Speaker 2>the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if we started moving </v>

606
00:28:37.361 --> 00:28:38.194
<v Speaker 2>more in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd have a much more functional </v>

607
00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:43.000
<v Speaker 2>government and definitely a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional economy.</v>

608
00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.073
<v Speaker 2>And so I would like to see more </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists moving into the political </v>

609
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.023
<v Speaker 2>arena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I can see why it would be </v>

610
00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:51.124
<v Speaker 2>disconcerting if you are a functioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>university scientists because you also </v>

611
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.270
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes receive federal money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then things start to get a little</v>

612
00:28:58.271 --> 00:29:00.070
<v Speaker 2>bit confusing about where your </v>
<v Speaker 2>allegiance lies.</v>

613
00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sam is not a university scientist.</v>

614
00:29:03.131 --> 00:29:05.830
<v Speaker 2>He was a trained academic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't work as an academic.</v>

615
00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:08.860
<v Speaker 2>He's an author.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does political punditry now.</v>

616
00:29:08.861 --> 00:29:09.694
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of his job and I applaud him </v>

617
00:29:11.321 --> 00:29:12.154
<v Speaker 2>for that even though he's on hit list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's on hitlist because of </v>

618
00:29:16.031 --> 00:29:16.631
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:29:16.631 --> 00:29:19.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a choice that he made and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really brave choice.</v>

620
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

621
00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I have no doubt he's on hitlist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

622
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.110
<v Speaker 1>there's like feed from today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's control.</v>

623
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.310
<v Speaker 1>So gmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about gmos before.</v>

624
00:29:27.311 --> 00:29:32.311
<v Speaker 1>Can you give me like a five minute sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gmo one one you say you just say gmo.</v>

625
00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.860
<v Speaker 1>People freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go monsanto and everyone goes.</v>

626
00:29:36.861 --> 00:29:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

627
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.380
<v Speaker 2>And lately there's this added confusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a scientist who I've interviewed</v>

628
00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:43.150
<v Speaker 2>many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple platforms named kevin folta has</v>

629
00:29:43.151 --> 00:29:43.984
<v Speaker 2>been in the news a lot because of a foya</v>
<v Speaker 2>requests that revealed some things that </v>

630
00:29:46.871 --> 00:29:47.704
<v Speaker 2>people didn't want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm mostly things that he never denied </v>

631
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

632
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:53.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't a lot of money that he got</v>

633
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:54.814
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But thAt's a whole other ethics get </v>

634
00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:57.640
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

635
00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but regardless of that,</v>

636
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to talk about the core of</v>
<v Speaker 2>gmos,</v>

637
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.130
<v Speaker 2>these other conversations really are </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant to this core conversation.</v>

638
00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Literally one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

639
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.340
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know anything about.</v>

640
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.290
<v Speaker 2>So what is a gmo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

641
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.423
<v Speaker 2>technIcally the word genetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>modified organism could refer to </v>

642
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:16.720
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any organism,</v>

643
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 2>anything that's alive in which the genes</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been modified.</v>

644
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:20.224
<v Speaker 2>So basically breeding two plants </v>
<v Speaker 2>together to try and get a desired trait </v>

645
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.730
<v Speaker 2>is technically gmo.</v>

646
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Now that's not how we casually use the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word anymore.</v>

647
00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:32.521
<v Speaker 2>We usually use the term gmo to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>refer to transgenic organism.</v>

648
00:30:32.731 --> 00:30:33.564
<v Speaker 2>So these are organisms where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't selectively bred for particular </v>

649
00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:36.694
<v Speaker 2>traits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was actually a transgene that </v>

650
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:40.240
<v Speaker 2>was inserted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've gotten into the laboratory,</v>

651
00:30:40.241 --> 00:30:43.330
<v Speaker 2>we've tested and we found these genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>markers,</v>

652
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:45.880
<v Speaker 2>these areas where we can do something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plant.</v>

653
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.893
<v Speaker 2>Generally we're talking about plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some animals that are up for </v>

654
00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:52.360
<v Speaker 2>fda approval like salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally we're talking about plants</v>

655
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.840
<v Speaker 2>and scientists will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

656
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.560
<v Speaker 2>this is a big one right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Citrus greening is wiping out oranges in</v>

657
00:30:59.561 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiping them out.</v>

658
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:01.863
<v Speaker 2>They're all really sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's getting harder and harder to get </v>

659
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:05.830
<v Speaker 2>fresh oranges and this is a problem that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't see going away.</v>

660
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Can we make oranges that are resistant </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this disease?</v>

661
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Because if we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may not have oranges anymore.</v>

662
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.863
<v Speaker 2>So the scIentists work very hard to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the genome to try and understand </v>

663
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.173
<v Speaker 2>all of these different genes within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plant and try and modify them in a </v>

664
00:31:21.551 --> 00:31:24.070
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it involves taking a gene from</v>

665
00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:27.790
<v Speaker 2>another plant and inserting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it involves turning a gene on,</v>

666
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.900
<v Speaker 2>silencing the gene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making a gene do something that maybe it</v>

667
00:31:31.901 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have done unless it was under </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>

668
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of different ways that you</v>

669
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:37.024
<v Speaker 2>can genetically modify a plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the things we've done for a </v>

670
00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:41.110
<v Speaker 2>long time for all kinds of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>plants.</v>

671
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:41.973
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are literally thousands of </v>

672
00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:45.603
<v Speaker 2>research versions of gmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are very few gmos that are on </v>

673
00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:51.430
<v Speaker 2>the market and I think that's another </v>
<v Speaker 2>big misconception.</v>

674
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.030
<v Speaker 2>People you'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

675
00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:53.983
<v Speaker 2>labels on crazy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you'll see labels on potatoes that </v>

676
00:31:56.741 --> 00:31:58.710
<v Speaker 2>are like gmo free and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

677
00:31:58.711 --> 00:31:59.544
<v Speaker 2>because there's no such thing as a gmo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not modifying it to stop </v>

678
00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:04.900
<v Speaker 2>either bugs from eating.</v>

679
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are in the lab but you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy it yet.</v>

680
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:11.410
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is the only crops that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>available are mostly big ag crops.</v>

681
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 2>So corn is genetically modified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably most of the corn that you eat.</v>

682
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Soybeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar beets.</v>

683
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm papaya is genetically modified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genetically modified.</v>

684
00:32:22.241 --> 00:32:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Apple Just came on the market or it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to,</v>

685
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:25.863
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the okinawa apple at that </v>

686
00:32:27.361 --> 00:32:28.210
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't brown.</v>

687
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.820
<v Speaker 2>You can take a bite out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depended on the table and the ground.</v>

688
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.430
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you try it?</v>

689
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.970
<v Speaker 2>It tastes like an apple gross and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>

690
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:37.661
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

691
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:38.494
<v Speaker 2>you've eaten a lot of gmos your day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any appendages that aren't </v>

692
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:43.880
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

693
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:44.963
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so from that very sort of simplistic </v>

694
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.353
<v Speaker 2>explanation of what gmos are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do so many people hate gmos because </v>

695
00:32:51.051 --> 00:32:51.884
<v Speaker 2>people are afraid of what they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand and there's a lot of </v>

696
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:54.344
<v Speaker 2>misinformation out there and so there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are some legitimate concerns when it </v>

697
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 2>comes to environmental consequences.</v>

698
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:00.283
<v Speaker 2>I think probably the most legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>concern when it comes to gmos is the </v>

699
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:08.470
<v Speaker 2>what is a normal outcome of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I use the example of super bugs with</v>

700
00:33:10.131 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics because I think it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>analogy.</v>

701
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.393
<v Speaker 2>so when we take antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we actually induce resistance in the </v>

702
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:18.434
<v Speaker 2>bugs that can infect us and now there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are whole classes of bugs that are </v>

703
00:33:20.751 --> 00:33:24.410
<v Speaker 2>resistant to those antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like in gmo plants,</v>

704
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:29.450
<v Speaker 2>when you alter them to resist certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>pests or to resist.</v>

705
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.313
<v Speaker 2>I'm mostly with the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you alter them to resist those </v>

706
00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:34.490
<v Speaker 2>pests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may have new pests that devolve,</v>

707
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.280
<v Speaker 2>that evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a resistance to that resistance.</v>

708
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.760
<v Speaker 2>You see it a little bit with weeds too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liKe the glyphosate argument,</v>

709
00:33:40.761 --> 00:33:42.890
<v Speaker 2>which is roundup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are really scared of roundup.</v>

710
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Bt is more the pes thing anD the </v>
<v Speaker 2>glyphosate is more of the weed thing and</v>

711
00:33:46.671 --> 00:33:48.170
<v Speaker 2>people sometimes mix those things up.</v>

712
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.270
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of where monsanto gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

713
00:33:50.271 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 2>But we were talking about cover that </v>
<v Speaker 2>another time.</v>

714
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.731
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

715
00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:53.720
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:57.770
<v Speaker 2>the potential for super weeds to grow </v>
<v Speaker 2>because these plants are,</v>

717
00:33:57.771 --> 00:34:00.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are helping them grow.</v>

718
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

719
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a natural process and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>just happen in gm.</v>

720
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.520
<v Speaker 2>It happens anytime that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>large scale agriculture.</v>

721
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.650
<v Speaker 2>And so I like to say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

722
00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:10.484
<v Speaker 2>would you want to take all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics off the market because </v>

723
00:34:13.881 --> 00:34:15.690
<v Speaker 2>they're making antibiotic resistance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

724
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.573
<v Speaker 2>we need to be smarter about how we use </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and we need to come up wIth new </v>

725
00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:18.944
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what scientists are actually </v>

726
00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:21.284
<v Speaker 2>doing is they're trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>new and better ways to improve </v>

727
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:27.830
<v Speaker 2>resistance to these different bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that there is a,</v>

728
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:28.664
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pesticide inside of a plant and the </v>

729
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:32.594
<v Speaker 2>bug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it develops resistance to that </v>

730
00:34:33.531 --> 00:34:34.364
<v Speaker 2>pesticide.</v>

731
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:35.323
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you actually alter that plant in two </v>

732
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:38.084
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you have two lines of defense </v>

733
00:34:39.561 --> 00:34:40.394
<v Speaker 2>against this bug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's statistically very unlikely that </v>

734
00:34:43.131 --> 00:34:43.964
<v Speaker 2>you'll get a mutation in that bug </v>
<v Speaker 2>against both of those lines of </v>

735
00:34:46.431 --> 00:34:47.264
<v Speaker 2>resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you can have a resistant plant </v>

736
00:34:48.621 --> 00:34:51.720
<v Speaker 2>and you're less likely to see resistance</v>
<v Speaker 2>occurring in the bug.</v>

737
00:34:51.721 --> 00:34:52.554
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

738
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:53.923
<v Speaker 2>scientists are always trying to keep one</v>
<v Speaker 2>step ahead of nature and these are the </v>

739
00:34:57.231 --> 00:35:00.140
<v Speaker 2>biggest problems that we're seeing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic modification.</v>

740
00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:04.820
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the problems that people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>are happening with genetic modification,</v>

741
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.100
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

742
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.130
<v Speaker 2>health problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's a big one,</v>

743
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 2>seeds blowing into another field and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting sued for it.</v>

744
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicides in India,</v>

745
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.410
<v Speaker 2>none of these are substantiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of them.</v>

746
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.430
<v Speaker 2>The science shows time and time again </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these are not real concerns.</v>

747
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.383
<v Speaker 2>And if you actually do dig into the case</v>
<v Speaker 2>law and you actually do try and </v>

748
00:35:28.611 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 2>understand what has happened legally in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these situations,</v>

749
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:36.850
<v Speaker 2>most of those lawsuits with the big ag </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies involve people storing,</v>

750
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.510
<v Speaker 2>which is technically against the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

751
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:42.510
<v Speaker 2>if you have a problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

752
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 2>patenting a c right?</v>

753
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole lot</v>

754
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.660
<v Speaker 2>if you have a problem with large scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>agribusiness and you have a problem with</v>

755
00:35:49.661 --> 00:35:54.340
<v Speaker 2>the way that we dry out the land by only</v>
<v Speaker 2>farming a very particular crop,</v>

756
00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.413
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that has nothing to do with genetic </v>

757
00:35:57.941 --> 00:36:01.030
<v Speaker 2>modification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we often conflate the issue.</v>

758
00:36:01.031 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

759
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 1>the topic of abortion never seems to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

760
00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to talk to you as someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>of science and uh,</v>

761
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:09.750
<v Speaker 1>as an atheist who obviously has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>morals,</v>

762
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.850
<v Speaker 1>how do you negotiate this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

763
00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be the people on the left,</v>

764
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.893
<v Speaker 1>when they talk about abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make it sound like everyone on the </v>

765
00:36:17.461 --> 00:36:20.730
<v Speaker 1>right hates women and that they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control women.</v>

766
00:36:20.731 --> 00:36:22.170
<v Speaker 1>And when people on the right talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

767
00:36:22.171 --> 00:36:25.500
<v Speaker 1>they make it sound like everyone on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left hates babies.</v>

768
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.380
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And neither one of those things.</v>

769
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.170
<v Speaker 1>That's very obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you,</v>

770
00:36:31.171 --> 00:36:34.410
<v Speaker 1>as someone that comes to conclusions </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on science,</v>

771
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.920
<v Speaker 1>how do you navigate the sort of ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume you're pro choice,</v>

772
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:39.600
<v Speaker 1>but actually I'm just assuming that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is that.</v>

773
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.593
<v Speaker 1>How do you then as someone that's pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice believes in edit and it's in </v>

774
00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:46.644
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you decide where like do you </v>

775
00:36:48.121 --> 00:36:50.610
<v Speaker 1>think that it should be a two month cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>off for an abortion?</v>

776
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.003
<v Speaker 1>Where do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you come up with that as </v>

777
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 1>someone that isn't coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious angle,</v>

778
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's coming from the science based </v>
<v Speaker 1>angle.</v>

779
00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I'd say abortion should be legal up </v>
<v Speaker 2>until 12 years old.</v>

780
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Pro like until the brain is fully known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually,</v>

781
00:37:05.421 --> 00:37:08.990
<v Speaker 2>that'd be more like 25 that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take off.</v>

782
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.143
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because I am an evidence </v>

783
00:37:12.081 --> 00:37:12.914
<v Speaker 2>based thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to be an evidence based thinker </v>

784
00:37:14.361 --> 00:37:15.194
<v Speaker 2>and a skeptical thinker and I try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to the science first and then </v>

785
00:37:18.651 --> 00:37:20.390
<v Speaker 2>make my political decisions based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

786
00:37:20.391 --> 00:37:22.910
<v Speaker 2>So I am liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am left wing,</v>

787
00:37:22.911 --> 00:37:25.520
<v Speaker 2>I am progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's easy to paint me in,</v>

788
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:29.270
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also super provax mandatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccinations.</v>

789
00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm pro gmo is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>

790
00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.520
<v Speaker 2>It's usually a more conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint,</v>

791
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:35.590
<v Speaker 2>so sometimes it's hard to put me in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>

792
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not pro life.</v>

793
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.710
<v Speaker 2>I am proud life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate that term.</v>

794
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:43.130
<v Speaker 2>It makes it sound like I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

795
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am choice not because it's,</v>

796
00:37:46.491 --> 00:37:47.324
<v Speaker 2>it's partially because of the science </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's partially because I'm not </v>

797
00:37:48.881 --> 00:37:53.881
<v Speaker 2>religious and I think that a lot of pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>life ideology comes purely from religion</v>

798
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.980
<v Speaker 2>and once you take religion out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>equation,</v>

799
00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.920
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a much more nuanced and </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated topic.</v>

800
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.053
<v Speaker 2>I am pro choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that I don't think that if a </v>

801
00:38:03.251 --> 00:38:04.084
<v Speaker 2>woman wants to have an abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she shouldn't be able to and I don't </v>

802
00:38:07.271 --> 00:38:09.640
<v Speaker 2>think that if a woman wants to keep her </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>

803
00:38:09.641 --> 00:38:11.590
<v Speaker 2>she should be coerced to have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>abortion.</v>

804
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.633
<v Speaker 2>I think that a woman should be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a decision based on her own body </v>

805
00:38:15.521 --> 00:38:16.354
<v Speaker 2>and in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which may sound kind of extreme until </v>

806
00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:21.640
<v Speaker 2>that baby is born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hers,</v>

807
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:22.623
<v Speaker 2>it's her body.</v>

808
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

809
00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.230
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess up untiL that point,</v>

810
00:38:25.231 --> 00:38:27.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely pro choice but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

811
00:38:27.611 --> 00:38:29.420
<v Speaker 1>but a week before the birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

812
00:38:29.421 --> 00:38:30.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

813
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I know that gets into your straw man </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument because it doesn't happen.</v>

814
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the voter id stuff,</v>

815
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like old voter fraud.</v>

816
00:38:37.661 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 2>We got to be careful about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women don't carry babies to a week,</v>

817
00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.880
<v Speaker 2>determine the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm gonna lose this baby</v>

818
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.310
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so at three months when the baby now</v>

819
00:38:45.311 --> 00:38:47.920
<v Speaker 1>has features and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these things,</v>

820
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.620
<v Speaker 1>and I guess this is the slippery slope </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to this point.</v>

821
00:38:50.621 --> 00:38:51.190
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

822
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.570
<v Speaker 2>legal first and second trimester </v>
<v Speaker 2>abortions are legal.</v>

823
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.120
<v Speaker 2>And I think that you have to look at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing,</v>

824
00:38:57.121 --> 00:38:57.954
<v Speaker 2>when you're writing laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to think about not just the </v>

825
00:39:01.441 --> 00:39:02.274
<v Speaker 2>obvious cases but the abberant cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why writing legislation is </v>

826
00:39:06.931 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 2>actually a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

827
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.173
<v Speaker 2>it's a nuanced and artistic endeavor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially within when you look at how </v>

828
00:39:12.811 --> 00:39:14.610
<v Speaker 2>you defend laws in the courts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

829
00:39:14.611 --> 00:39:15.444
<v Speaker 2>When you look at case law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated because we have to </v>

830
00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:19.860
<v Speaker 2>fully understand all of the times when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

831
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:24.630
<v Speaker 2>when the laws can be misused or </v>
<v Speaker 2>misinterpreted and there are cases,</v>

832
00:39:24.631 --> 00:39:25.464
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where a woman does not know that she is </v>

833
00:39:27.121 --> 00:39:27.954
<v Speaker 2>pregnant until well into her pregnancy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you do have to take that </v>

834
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.033
<v Speaker 2>into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are cases in which women are </v>

835
00:39:34.801 --> 00:39:39.630
<v Speaker 2>victims of coercion or abuse or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it is more nuanced than that.</v>

836
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they feel pressure from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>husband,</v>

837
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:42.743
<v Speaker 2>their boyfriend or a member of society </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a baby and they don't realize </v>

838
00:39:47.341 --> 00:39:49.350
<v Speaker 2>until later that they do have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>options.</v>

839
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they fall on financially difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

840
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they find out that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

841
00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.403
<v Speaker 2>some sort of genetic abnormality and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby and that they don't have the means </v>

842
00:39:58.171 --> 00:39:59.004
<v Speaker 2>to raise that baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that all of those really </v>

843
00:40:01.081 --> 00:40:04.380
<v Speaker 2>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really emotional personal questions have</v>

844
00:40:04.381 --> 00:40:08.880
<v Speaker 2>to be taken into account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say,</v>

845
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:09.743
<v Speaker 2>and it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy for me to say because I don't </v>

846
00:40:11.071 --> 00:40:11.904
<v Speaker 2>have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the woman is the vessel and she is </v>

847
00:40:15.811 --> 00:40:19.680
<v Speaker 2>carrying this child and until the child </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out of her,</v>

848
00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:20.723
<v Speaker 2>it is her body is her choice and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are her rights and I do think that it's </v>

849
00:40:24.481 --> 00:40:25.314
<v Speaker 2>a complicated topic and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's important that we do </v>

850
00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:28.890
<v Speaker 2>talk about it</v>

851
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:29.743
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost regret having said the part </v>

852
00:40:32.901 --> 00:40:36.710
<v Speaker 1>about the one week before birth because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it is a straw man and it does.</v>

853
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.613
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's something </v>

854
00:40:38.841 --> 00:40:42.560
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the when is it really </v>
<v Speaker 1>a feasible life thing that and obviously</v>

855
00:40:42.561 --> 00:40:43.394
<v Speaker 1>we can't resolve that</v>

856
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.373
<v Speaker 2>and I think that we have to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>every possible option because even </v>

857
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.270
<v Speaker 2>religious people you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find that.</v>

858
00:40:49.271 --> 00:40:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Whereas they would be appalled if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got knocked out and had an abortion.</v>

859
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.793
<v Speaker 2>They might go get ivf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which some religions don't even allow </v>

860
00:40:55.511 --> 00:40:56.344
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they might get ivf and of course </v>

861
00:40:57.101 --> 00:41:00.520
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do selective reduction </v>
<v Speaker 2>during ivf.</v>

862
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Is that not abortion in the interview?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

863
00:41:02.441 --> 00:41:04.470
<v Speaker 2>it's very complicated because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

864
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.313
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you do ivf and like five of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them stick and then you turn into john </v>

865
00:41:08.921 --> 00:41:09.754
<v Speaker 2>and kate plus eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess the most extreme religious </v>

866
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:14.250
<v Speaker 2>people even in those cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>

867
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.000
<v Speaker 2>look at a babY as a blessing from god.</v>

868
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.670
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like people pick and choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>when to believe in religion.</v>

869
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:20.423
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

870
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.290
<v Speaker 1>one more for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

871
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:23.223
<v Speaker 1>what I want to do with all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews is sort of end on a very </v>

872
00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:27.580
<v Speaker 1>personal note and we actually started on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a personal note because you talked about</v>

873
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:31.240
<v Speaker 1>leaving the church and very personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>things related to atheism.</v>

874
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:33.483
<v Speaker 1>So you have talked about your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a battle or struggle with depression </v>

875
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.320
<v Speaker 1>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty vocally.</v>

876
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

877
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I know you pretty well over the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>three years.</v>

878
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:47.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that we talk about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot privately and yeah,</v>

879
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.503
<v Speaker 1>it's not actually well in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you to be totally like happy and </v>

880
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:57.740
<v Speaker 1>well adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you struggle with depression.</v>

881
00:41:57.741 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

882
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Really good actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>

883
00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:02.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a coping mechanism that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop.</v>

884
00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:03.123
<v Speaker 2>And that's not to say that like every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day of my life I'm pretending to be </v>

885
00:42:06.251 --> 00:42:10.420
<v Speaker 2>happy because I experience joy and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience happiness on a regular basis.</v>

886
00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm also in treatment and I take </v>
<v Speaker 2>medication every day.</v>

887
00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:17.560
<v Speaker 2>And that has made a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there have been periods of my life where</v>

888
00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:18.603
<v Speaker 2>if you had seen me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I would not have allowed you to </v>

889
00:42:20.051 --> 00:42:21.910
<v Speaker 2>see me because I was very private,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

890
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.983
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we come up with our strategies and we </v>

891
00:42:23.831 --> 00:42:24.664
<v Speaker 2>come up with our coping mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we had been in a position where you </v>

892
00:42:28.361 --> 00:42:31.210
<v Speaker 2>had seen me at my lowest of lows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

893
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be saying the same thing.</v>

894
00:42:33.071 --> 00:42:33.904
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that that's a common </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience for people who struggle with </v>

895
00:42:37.181 --> 00:42:38.014
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a private side of your </v>

896
00:42:39.131 --> 00:42:42.310
<v Speaker 2>depression and then there's a public </v>
<v Speaker 2>face if you're willing to have one,</v>

897
00:42:42.311 --> 00:42:43.690
<v Speaker 2>which not many people are.</v>

898
00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:46.100
<v Speaker 2>And I completely understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

899
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I personally feel like I have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility as somebody who has a bit</v>

900
00:42:50.441 --> 00:42:51.070
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

901
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people tweet me,</v>

902
00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.221
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

903
00:42:54.221 --> 00:42:55.054
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

904
00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people know that I exist and I,</v>

905
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.280
<v Speaker 2>and I've noticed that when I do talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>

906
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:03.940
<v Speaker 2>the feedback that I get is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

907
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.313
<v Speaker 2>it just makes me feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me feel good to know how many </v>

908
00:43:07.781 --> 00:43:08.614
<v Speaker 2>people are out there who are struggling </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this and don't see that a lot of </v>

909
00:43:12.221 --> 00:43:15.040
<v Speaker 2>people are talking about it publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because of that,</v>

910
00:43:15.041 --> 00:43:17.020
<v Speaker 2>I feel a real obligation to do it.</v>

911
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Is it depressing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's an odd choice.</v>

912
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depressing.</v>

913
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Is it depressing to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or disconcerting,</v>

914
00:43:25.091 --> 00:43:25.924
<v Speaker 1>I suppose would be a better word that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really have a mental health </v>

915
00:43:28.571 --> 00:43:29.404
<v Speaker 1>discussion in this country anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like maybe five years ago we </v>

916
00:43:31.511 --> 00:43:32.344
<v Speaker 1>actually did a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People talked about a little bit and </v>

917
00:43:35.261 --> 00:43:36.094
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was around when the </v>

918
00:43:36.851 --> 00:43:40.930
<v Speaker 1>shooting started really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we do anymore with the</v>

919
00:43:40.931 --> 00:43:41.764
<v Speaker 1>shootings were not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were not immediately go into the gun </v>

920
00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.910
<v Speaker 1>thing and that's obviously we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that discussion,</v>

921
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.140
<v Speaker 1>but I worry that the mental health,</v>

922
00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:52.140
<v Speaker 2>the thing is like escape goat for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gun advocates so you have the gun nutter</v>

923
00:43:52.271 --> 00:43:54.820
<v Speaker 2>butters and are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because of gone,</v>

924
00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:57.430
<v Speaker 2>it's because he was mentally ill and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have gotten.</v>

925
00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that that's not also a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very important conversation to have,</v>

926
00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:03.760
<v Speaker 2>but just like we should be having </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations about gun control</v>

927
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.070
<v Speaker 1>when we're not in crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

928
00:44:06.071 --> 00:44:06.904
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're having like sexual </v>

929
00:44:07.781 --> 00:44:08.614
<v Speaker 1>problems at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not a good idea to talk about </v>

930
00:44:10.841 --> 00:44:11.674
<v Speaker 1>them when you're both like naked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's better to wait until it's a </v>

931
00:44:15.551 --> 00:44:17.070
<v Speaker 1>more calm situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

932
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:17.651
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

933
00:44:17.651 --> 00:44:18.484
<v Speaker 1>Sorry I didn't run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't really into it or I couldn't get </v>

934
00:44:19.901 --> 00:44:22.710
<v Speaker 1>it up or whatever it was going on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a safe</v>

935
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.793
<v Speaker 2>time to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same thing when it </v>

936
00:44:25.091 --> 00:44:28.390
<v Speaker 2>comes to both gun control and mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

937
00:44:28.391 --> 00:44:29.224
<v Speaker 2>like we should be talking about this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the light and in the dark because it's </v>

938
00:44:33.361 --> 00:44:34.194
<v Speaker 2>not really that helpful when we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it only in crisis and I think it also </v>

939
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.880
<v Speaker 2>elevates and ignores the day to day </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggles that people have.</v>

940
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression is a massive illness and it's</v>

941
00:44:44.761 --> 00:44:45.594
<v Speaker 2>a biological illness and it's an illness</v>
<v Speaker 2>that destroys lives and it is so </v>

942
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.730
<v Speaker 2>treatable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that,</v>

943
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country especially,</v>

944
00:44:56.401 --> 00:44:57.234
<v Speaker 2>I think with the older set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are getting better just like with </v>

945
00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.873
<v Speaker 2>coming out as atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We aren't getting better with the </v>

946
00:45:01.171 --> 00:45:02.004
<v Speaker 2>younger people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Erasing that stigma and being more </v>

947
00:45:03.991 --> 00:45:04.824
<v Speaker 2>comfortable talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is we still treat </v>

948
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.940
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric illnesses like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like disorders of will,</v>

949
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fundamental hurdle that we have</v>

950
00:45:15.031 --> 00:45:17.640
<v Speaker 2>to get past that somehow you can will </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself out of it.</v>

951
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.700
<v Speaker 2>That somehow you can change your </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns of thInking.</v>

952
00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Just think more positively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do that and you'll be.</v>

953
00:45:24.331 --> 00:45:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because people don't understand the</v>

954
00:45:27.751 --> 00:45:32.751
<v Speaker 2>biological basis of these issues and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've never treated depression.</v>

955
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:33.804
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way that we've treated </v>

956
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:35.514
<v Speaker 2>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would never shame somebody into </v>

957
00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 2>needing insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

958
00:45:38.761 --> 00:45:39.594
<v Speaker 2>But we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shame people who take </v>

959
00:45:40.951 --> 00:45:41.784
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shame people who have to take </v>

960
00:45:43.591 --> 00:45:48.591
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric medication and that's just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge bummer and I hate to see young kids</v>

961
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:53.190
<v Speaker 2>either being scared away for it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling like they're not allowed,</v>

962
00:45:53.191 --> 00:45:54.330
<v Speaker 2>are scared away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

963
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:55.164
<v Speaker 2>Or feeling like they're not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be honest with themselves and older </v>

964
00:45:59.641 --> 00:46:00.930
<v Speaker 2>people too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father,</v>

965
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:04.560
<v Speaker 2>my father went through a depressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode and my father has struggled with</v>

966
00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:05.394
<v Speaker 2>some things and I remember when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally told me when I was struggling </v>

967
00:46:07.441 --> 00:46:10.080
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so meaningful for me.</v>

968
00:46:10.081 --> 00:46:11.930
<v Speaker 2>It helped me so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

969
00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.710
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much has explained.</v>

970
00:46:13.711 --> 00:46:16.770
<v Speaker 2>And then he became this confidant and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could talk to them about it,</v>

971
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.813
<v Speaker 2>but I had no idea what he was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it because he lives a </v>

972
00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:20.430
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>

973
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like a self fulfilling prophecy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost the shame then just continues the</v>

974
00:46:23.911 --> 00:46:24.744
<v Speaker 1>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile you hear it from your father </v>

975
00:46:25.861 --> 00:46:28.050
<v Speaker 1>and that it probably makes you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>better in,</v>

976
00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:28.670
<v Speaker 1>in who you are.</v>

977
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:29.181
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing,</v>

978
00:46:29.181 --> 00:46:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you just said is so important.</v>

979
00:46:30.771 --> 00:46:33.620
<v Speaker 2>There's this negative feedback when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're depressed,</v>

980
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.100
<v Speaker 2>like actually physically experiencing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressive episode,</v>

981
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:38.263
<v Speaker 2>such a big portion of that is guilt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shame and to have an added layer of </v>

982
00:46:42.711 --> 00:46:43.544
<v Speaker 2>guilt and shame that comes from society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not understanding your depression and </v>

983
00:46:48.111 --> 00:46:51.770
<v Speaker 2>then having to carry the guilt of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed while you're depressed.</v>

984
00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.800
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>

985
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:55.783
<v Speaker 2>And so I think the more that we become </v>
<v Speaker 2>open about it and the more that we </v>

986
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.983
<v Speaker 2>celebrate all of our differences and our</v>
<v Speaker 2>quirks and the more that we understand </v>

987
00:47:03.111 --> 00:47:03.944
<v Speaker 2>that going to therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like something that a lot more </v>

988
00:47:06.471 --> 00:47:09.350
<v Speaker 2>people should probably do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

989
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.273
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being okay with that and being okay </v>

990
00:47:11.511 --> 00:47:13.640
<v Speaker 2>with the fact that we all have our </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

991
00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.460
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we all struggle and I think it makes</v>

992
00:47:16.461 --> 00:47:19.610
<v Speaker 2>us richer and it makes us more </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting and it makes us more human.</v>

993
00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

994
00:47:20.901 --> 00:47:22.190
<v Speaker 2>That's the world I want to live in.</v>

995
00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the world that want to live.</v>

996
00:47:23.501 --> 00:47:25.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think we did a little talk therapy</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

997
00:47:25.151 --> 00:47:25.984
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel now?</v>

998
00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:26.480
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

999
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.930
<v Speaker 2>definitely not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might shrink.</v>

1000
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Shrink would probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like to hear that.</v>

1001
00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:35.330
<v Speaker 1>This is a therapy session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1002
00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.810

<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what.</v>

1003
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.640
<v Speaker 1>That was a hell of an outro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1004
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Well cara,</v>
