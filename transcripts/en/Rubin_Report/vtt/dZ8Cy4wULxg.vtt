1
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.893
<v Speaker 1>Monday was Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King Junior Day and as is </v>

2
00:00:07.851 --> 00:00:08.684
<v Speaker 1>the case with almost everything lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually everyone on social media </v>

3
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:12.524
<v Speaker 1>seemed to parse out mlks words for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever narrative they're currently </v>

4
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:16.574
<v Speaker 1>pushing in our modern times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw articles on how Mlk was the first </v>

5
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he was an ardent feminist,</v>

6
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:23.420
<v Speaker 1>a communist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a socialist,</v>

7
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:24.254
<v Speaker 1>and much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one quote I tweeted of his is </v>

8
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:27.884
<v Speaker 1>perhaps his most famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a dream that my four little </v>

9
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:31.544
<v Speaker 1>children will one day live in a nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they will not be judged by the </v>

10
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>color of their skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the content of their character.</v>

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I believe this quote to be as relevant </v>
<v Speaker 1>now as it was in the early 1960s but for</v>

12
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:45.524
<v Speaker 1>a whole other set of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the 1960s mlk was fighting for </v>

13
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>equality under the law and equality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to things that we should all</v>

14
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>absolutely believe in today.</v>

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.433
<v Speaker 1>Those who judge people by the color of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their skin and not the content of their </v>

16
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:04.220
<v Speaker 1>character are fighting not for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality,</v>

17
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>but for special treatment of some at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusion of others.</v>

18
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>This misguided principle thinking you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should treat someone differently because</v>

19
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:14.144
<v Speaker 1>of their skin color or thinking someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>should believe what you think they </v>

20
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:18.614
<v Speaker 1>should believe because of their skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>color or any other immutable </v>

21
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>characteristic is the essence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice,</v>

22
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>which means to prejudge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the complete reverse of what mlk</v>

23
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:30.074
<v Speaker 1>stood for and sadly this way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>has infected the modern left almost </v>

24
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why like myself,</v>

25
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:37.754
<v Speaker 1>so many of you find yourselves on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of a political bubble that you </v>

26
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 1>were once safely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of for this direct message though,</v>

27
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:47.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to focus on the flaws of </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics.</v>

28
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:47.924
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to focus on one of the other </v>

29
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:51.920
<v Speaker 1>topics I just mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>

30
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.993
<v Speaker 1>and for the purposes of this message I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to put aside whether mlk was a </v>

31
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:59.810
<v Speaker 1>capitalist or a communist or a socialist</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a hybrid of any of them.</v>

32
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.973
<v Speaker 1>What I want to discuss is some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction around the word socialism </v>

33
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of people I see talking about</v>

34
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>socialism positively is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>staggering.</v>

35
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>A tweet I set out saying socialism isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

36
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:14.804
<v Speaker 1>Even got me into a little exchange on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter with the official verified </v>

37
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Socialist Party who explained to me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism has actually never been tried,</v>

38
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 1>which is why we don't know if it'll work</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

39
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.813
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps they should tell that to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people of Venezuela right now who were </v>

40
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:29.444
<v Speaker 1>fighting for food and basic services as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they watched their socialist system </v>

41
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.400
<v Speaker 1>collapse on top of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ideas of socialism,</v>

42
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>that the means of production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution and labor should be owned,</v>

43
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:41.924
<v Speaker 1>controlled and regulated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community as a whole are the worst sort </v>

44
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:46.934
<v Speaker 1>of collectivist ideas which exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very implication that the group </v>

45
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:51.734
<v Speaker 1>knows what is good for the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we exist to do things for the </v>

46
00:02:55.281 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>greater good is totally antithetical to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of being human.</v>

47
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>It's your job to find value in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

48
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.803
<v Speaker 1>to strive for more than you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring good to yourself and the people </v>

49
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>around you and to live as a free person </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you see fit.</v>

50
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.413
<v Speaker 1>The very idea that you should set aside </v>
<v Speaker 1>your individuality for the community as </v>

51
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.034
<v Speaker 1>a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which virtually always turns into an </v>

52
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:25.141
<v Speaker 1>intolerant hostile mob is exactly why so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many have died in socialist regimes.</v>

53
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Despite the obvious failures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>

54
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Socialists have no problem using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedoms of capitalism against itself.</v>

55
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>This is perhaps the most perverse part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the socialist worldview.</v>

56
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.693
<v Speaker 1>Much like Islamism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism wants to use our freedoms </v>

57
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>against us until it attains complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

58
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.653
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use the tools of twitter and </v>

59
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:53.611
<v Speaker 1>facebook companies created through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingenuity of individuals and the freedom</v>

60
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>of capitalism to attack the very system </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they often live in.</v>

61
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.523
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for them being able to do this </v>

62
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>even if I don't like what they're doing.</v>

63
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.443
<v Speaker 1>That's the tricky part of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It even applies to people and ideas you </v>

64
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think for a moment,</v>

65
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>if we had a socialist government in </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge right now,</v>

66
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>how do you think it would be going for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free expression and free speech?</v>

67
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.820
<v Speaker 1>How tolerant would they be of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that they label,</v>

68
00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:20.654
<v Speaker 1>Nazis and bigots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you may think of Donald Trump </v>

69
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>and the evil capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they the ones coming for anyone?</v>

70
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Speech right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our reporters being put in jail.</v>

71
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.143
<v Speaker 1>Actually President Obama used the </v>
<v Speaker 1>espionage act to put a record number of </v>

72
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>reporters in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as far as I know,</v>

73
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 1>trump who dislikes the press to put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>mildly,</v>

74
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>hasn't put anyone in prison for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime of journalism.</v>

75
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.763
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a rising tide in America based on </v>

76
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom and individual choice.</v>

77
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Note how those words themselves are </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow thought of as evil.</v>

78
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 1>In the socialist lexicon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>

79
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:57.214
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and individual choice must all be </v>

80
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed for the greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The what they're not telling you is that</v>

81
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:09.031
<v Speaker 1>the greater good is usually for the tiny</v>
<v Speaker 1>minority in the elite protected class.</v>

82
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.383
<v Speaker 1>Their ideas have never worked and will </v>
<v Speaker 1>never work because a system built on </v>

83
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:19.171
<v Speaker 1>stripping our humanity is in direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict with what it means to be human.</v>

84
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I've said it before and I'll say it </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

85
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:22.204
<v Speaker 1>This perfect system which they wish to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create can never be perfect because we </v>

86
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>humans as flawed as we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are part of it.</v>

87
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Imperfect beings cannot create a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

88
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.863
<v Speaker 1>but what we can create as a system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>always does its best to further the </v>

89
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>advancement of human freedom for all its</v>
<v Speaker 1>flaws.</v>

90
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.933
<v Speaker 1>This is what capitalism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why if you're watching this </v>

91
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:46.894
<v Speaker 1>from a capitalist society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should consider yourself one of the </v>

92
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>lucky ones.</v>

93
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>

94
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>politicians don't outright call </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves socialists.</v>

95
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>They say that their democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialists,</v>

96
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.763
<v Speaker 1>this is Bernie Sanders Mantra as he </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls for a revolution of every kind to </v>

97
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>be a political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social or even environmental,</v>

98
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:04.244
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Bernie forgets or intentionally </v>

99
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>obfuscates is that the democratic part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>

100
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:09.614
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will always be tossed away as socialism </v>

101
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:13.334
<v Speaker 1>takes root.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also why there's no doubt in my </v>

102
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>mind that eventually the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

103
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:18.194
<v Speaker 1>we'll turn on Bernie himself and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's already plenty of evidence of </v>

104
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:21.734
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democracy is the enemy of socialism and </v>

105
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:25.214
<v Speaker 1>Bernie's trying to have it both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also a reason that the social </v>

106
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 1>justice movement has such a socialist </v>
<v Speaker 1>strain within it.</v>

107
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Both of these movements based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>frowning,</v>

108
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:36.134
<v Speaker 1>on achievement and accomplishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a resentment of those who break the </v>

109
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.064
<v Speaker 1>mold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need people to be oppressed or at least </v>

110
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 1>believe that they're oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to survive creativity,</v>

111
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:51.221
<v Speaker 1>free thought and the pursuit of your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness is the antidote to both social</v>

112
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:52.364
<v Speaker 1>justice and socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's either that or a life of </v>

113
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>bitterness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>

114
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:57.764
<v Speaker 1>and jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in my view is less socialism and </v>

115
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 1>more just antisocial.</v>

116

<v Speaker 3>director of turning point USA,</v>

118
00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:14.250
<v Speaker 3>a student organization for young </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives,</v>

119
00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:17.340
<v Speaker 3>which advocates for free markets and </v>
<v Speaker 3>limited government.</v>

120
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Kirk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Glad to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Fan.</v>

122
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.740
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young Conservatives.</v>

123
00:07:22.741 --> 00:07:26.460
<v Speaker 3>I thought there was no such thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like the Yeti or the Unicorn or</v>

124
00:07:26.461 --> 00:07:27.294
<v Speaker 3>Falcor or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more of us than you might </v>

125
00:07:29.551 --> 00:07:31.020
<v Speaker 3>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not all conservative.</v>

126
00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:33.690
<v Speaker 3>Some are libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some are free thinkers,</v>

127
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.880
<v Speaker 3>independence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the center.</v>

128
00:07:35.881 --> 00:07:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just had that amazing conference that</v>

129
00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:41.160
<v Speaker 3>you were nice enough to come down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak at in Florida.</v>

130
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2000,</v>

131
00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:45.240
<v Speaker 3>600,</v>
<v Speaker 3>700 students from all 50 states.</v>

132
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.373
<v Speaker 3>And it was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't pay the media outlets to </v>

133
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.043
<v Speaker 3>cover this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you know,</v>

134
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.240
<v Speaker 3>I was calling up the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington Post here.</v>

135
00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:52.270
<v Speaker 3>We had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

136
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.153
<v Speaker 3>thousands of students given up their </v>
<v Speaker 3>winter break to come here from you and </v>

137
00:07:56.731 --> 00:07:58.380
<v Speaker 3>me and the best speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

138
00:07:58.381 --> 00:07:59.214
<v Speaker 3>that advocate for freedom and none of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the media outlets in the traditional </v>

139
00:08:01.531 --> 00:08:02.730
<v Speaker 3>media outlets covered it.</v>

140
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:03.900
<v Speaker 3>But it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a,</v>

141
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.560
<v Speaker 3>there is a revolution happening on these</v>
<v Speaker 3>campuses but it's not,</v>

142
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.840
<v Speaker 3>it's not against,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

143
00:08:09.841 --> 00:08:10.710
<v Speaker 3>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this,</v>

144
00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:11.220
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

145
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.730
<v Speaker 3>it's a new train of thought that we want</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>

146
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.100
<v Speaker 3>we want smaller government but it's also</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting the culture war,</v>

147
00:08:17.101 --> 00:08:17.934
<v Speaker 3>which is for free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for diversity of ideas and really </v>

148
00:08:20.821 --> 00:08:22.760
<v Speaker 3>against what these college campuses have</v>
<v Speaker 3>created.</v>

149
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.663
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're in the thick of a lot of the </v>

150
00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:26.850
<v Speaker 3>things obviously that we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

151
00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:29.790
<v Speaker 3>So first I just want to talk briefly </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how we met,</v>

152
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.810
<v Speaker 3>because I think it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of shows sort of how you operate</v>

153
00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:34.644
<v Speaker 3>and why turning point has taken off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had met about a month and a half </v>

154
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.350
<v Speaker 3>ago at the is freedom Santeria then in </v>
<v Speaker 3>palm springs.</v>

155
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 3>Where you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you at panelists?</v>

156
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.290
<v Speaker 3>There I was a panelist and he's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>helicoptering around of a lot of friends</v>

157
00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:47.030
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

158
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.710
<v Speaker 3>attending that conference you were there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everyone was like,</v>

159
00:08:49.711 --> 00:08:51.600
<v Speaker 3>oh you got to meet Charlie [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got To be trying to hurt.</v>

160
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.473
<v Speaker 3>We met for two seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said a couple of Nice things about </v>

161
00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 3>me and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know we're doing this,</v>

162
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.963
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our gig in palm springs in a couple of </v>

163
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.860
<v Speaker 4>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you come down and talk and,</v>

164
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.763
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and immediately we worked it out and </v>

165
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 4>your guys send me the paper work the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next day and it was done.</v>

166
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.173
<v Speaker 4>And I think that does illustrate </v>
<v Speaker 4>something cause we're going to get into </v>

167
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:08.604
<v Speaker 4>some of the issues that should be agree </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and some of the things we disagree </v>

168
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But basically you were like,</v>

169
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:12.511
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

170
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 4>you're down for free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the main thing here.</v>

171
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.360
<v Speaker 4>And I want my audience to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to hear you talk about it.</v>

172
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

173
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.570
<v Speaker 3>you're a rational thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really rare to find them.</v>

174
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kidding.</v>

175
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.743
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm a big fan of the show and I </v>

176
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 3>watch a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every interviews and I know you're,</v>

177
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a huge following amongst young </v>

178
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:32.030
<v Speaker 3>people and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met you,</v>

179
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:32.671
<v Speaker 3>I met you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

180
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get you on board.</v>

181
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.673
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been a gut player for </v>

182
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:35.761
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for worse.</v>

183
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 3>It's gotten me into a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble at times,</v>

184
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.470
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's been positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have to,</v>

185
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 3>you have to go with your gut and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>quick decisions and similar,</v>

186
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Speaker 3>that's where I met kandace owens to </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's now doing a wonderful job with us.</v>

187
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 3>And it took me about 45 seconds until I </v>
<v Speaker 3>offered her a job.</v>

188
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.093
<v Speaker 4>Literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it happened right in front of </v>

189
00:09:52.521 --> 00:09:53.630
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you walked up to him.</v>

190
00:09:53.631 --> 00:09:54.500
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Candice was like,</v>

191
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:56.030
<v Speaker 4>I just got a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you were like,</v>

192
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:58.400
<v Speaker 4>let me do something with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was just like,</v>

193
00:09:58.401 --> 00:09:58.881
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

194
00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 4>this guy's obviously open to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>different people in total in the Schema,</v>

195
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.420
<v Speaker 4>what's going on.</v>

196
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.100
<v Speaker 3>You need the diversity of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

197
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:06.963
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a room where everyone </v>

198
00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:10.480
<v Speaker 3>thinks exactly the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a university.</v>

199
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.553
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

200
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.813
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need the diversity ideas and you </v>

201
00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:14.734
<v Speaker 3>need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be able to challenge your </v>

202
00:10:16.091 --> 00:10:19.120
<v Speaker 3>viewpoint around a broader theme of </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>

203
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that really is okay to have that sort of</v>

204
00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:22.810
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>

205
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:23.643
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to,</v>

206
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.930
<v Speaker 4>to illustrate that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then about,</v>

207
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.783
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the week before </v>

208
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.893
<v Speaker 4>Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys do this.</v>

209
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.850
<v Speaker 4>I was it the largest conservative </v>
<v Speaker 4>college group we're waiting for.</v>

210
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.440
<v Speaker 3>We're waiting for someone to correct us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've done some research.</v>

211
00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:40.640
<v Speaker 3>We have never found anything even close </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll have 2,650</v>

212
00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:41.474
<v Speaker 3>students from all 50 states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's really found anything even </v>

213
00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:45.404
<v Speaker 3>comparable of size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we call it the largest until someone </v>

214
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:47.924
<v Speaker 3>corrects us.</v>

215
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there you had some protesters out there,</v>

216
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they show up all the time to everything.</v>

217
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.173
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was true diversity of thought </v>

218
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.383
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was also sort of a Reuben report and </v>

219
00:10:57.061 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 4>reunion for me because prager was there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Gutfeld was there.</v>

220
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.103
<v Speaker 4>All my best friend candace was there </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously and and a whole bunch of </v>

221
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:04.440
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

222
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.380
<v Speaker 4>Well trump junior was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it just a series of people?</v>

223
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 4>I went up there and I talked about being</v>
<v Speaker 4>gay,</v>

224
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:15.960
<v Speaker 4>married and I talked about being pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>choice and a and a bunch of other things</v>

225
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:16.794
<v Speaker 4>that if you were to poll the average </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative that perhaps they're not </v>

226
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:21.330
<v Speaker 4>for I think gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a little,</v>

227
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.373
<v Speaker 4>a little different at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I got a standing ovation and </v>

228
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.140
<v Speaker 4>everywhere that I lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

229
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.573
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of times and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everywhere that I went for those </v>

230
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three days that I was there and it,</v>

231
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 4>and by no means was this just me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Ben Shapiro came out,</v>

232
00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like Elvis.</v>

233
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 4>I going to say it was like the rolling </v>
<v Speaker 4>stones is nuts,</v>

234
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.770
<v Speaker 4>but that happened to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went for breakfast,</v>

235
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:46.710
<v Speaker 4>I need coffee before I talked to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet I'm literally,</v>

236
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:48.840
<v Speaker 4>there's a line of a hundred people </v>
<v Speaker 4>popping up.</v>

237
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:49.674
<v Speaker 4>It's like they start swearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that said something to me beyond </v>

238
00:11:52.861 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's something</v>

239
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 3>else going on with young people right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now where they actually,</v>

240
00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 3>as the young people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

241
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:02.290
<v Speaker 3>they're really woke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's happening here?</v>

242
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.303
<v Speaker 3>And it's that diversity of ideas that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think illustrates what makes our </v>

243
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:06.244
<v Speaker 3>organization so unique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a reporter came up to me and he was </v>

244
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 3>totally dishonest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

245
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:10.601
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

246
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 3>this feels like a Donald Trump rally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

247
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:14.530
<v Speaker 3>how could you possibly say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

248
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:16.360
<v Speaker 3>We have trump jr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have Gorka.</v>

249
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 3>We also Austin Petersen who ran for </v>
<v Speaker 3>president in the Libertarian Party.</v>

250
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.993
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have Ruben who is not a leftist </v>

251
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:24.724
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's somewhere out there and he </v>

252
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 3>believes in freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

253
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.860
<v Speaker 3>We've been Shapiro who literally led the</v>
<v Speaker 3>never trump,</v>

254
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.313
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

255
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a huge diversity.</v>

256
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Dorsey of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And each speaker was respected,</v>

257
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:37.960
<v Speaker 3>was given,</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing ovations,</v>

258
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:38.794
<v Speaker 3>was challenged appropriately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that really says something </v>

259
00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 3>about this new conservate terrian </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement that we're helping create,</v>

260
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.860
<v Speaker 3>which is we don't have to agree on 100% </v>
<v Speaker 3>of conservative dogma.</v>

261
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Let's just get the big stuff right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The big stuff.</v>

262
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Is America a great country?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

263
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 3>It's free enterprise a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

264
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.361
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's freedom.</v>

265
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 3>Something that we should really embrace </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a general idea.</v>

266
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:02.560
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's socialism bad.</v>

267
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.543
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just pretty much the main key </v>

268
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:07.810
<v Speaker 3>points in the rest of the stuff we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>argue and disagree with.</v>

269
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:08.860
<v Speaker 3>Respectfully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

270
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.630
<v Speaker 3>When did you wake up to some of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff?</v>

271
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.640
<v Speaker 3>So just tell me a little bit about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up and your situation.</v>

272
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.680
<v Speaker 3>I was ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Politics,</v>

273
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.671
<v Speaker 3>current,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>

274
00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:16.504
<v Speaker 3>crazy kid growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grew up in the northwest suburbs of </v>

275
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

276
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.283
<v Speaker 3>always as a conservative Republican </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up around a lot of leftists and </v>

277
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 3>liberals in my public high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was young and conservative like,</v>

278
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.213
<v Speaker 3>cause I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved history and I was always </v>

279
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:31.091
<v Speaker 3>contrarion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

280
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 3>So I'd always be challenging my </v>
<v Speaker 3>teachers.</v>

281
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 3>My parents were generally republican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

282
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:36.290
<v Speaker 3>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

283
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.510
<v Speaker 3>necessarily political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were center,</v>

284
00:13:38.511 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill O'Reilly factor watching,</v>

285
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:42.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans that I always used to say.</v>

286
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 3>And then I would always just challenged </v>
<v Speaker 3>teachers that would say that,</v>

287
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.203
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all conservatives want to do is kill </v>

288
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:49.600
<v Speaker 3>poor people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pollute the environment.</v>

289
00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:50.950
<v Speaker 3>The typical talking points,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

290
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And being the kind of,</v>

291
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>red bull,</v>

292
00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:55.264
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd always challenged the teachers and </v>

293
00:13:56.651 --> 00:13:57.221
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

294
00:13:57.221 --> 00:13:58.054
<v Speaker 3>Ronald Reagan lifted more people out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty than you're crazy social </v>

295
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:02.950
<v Speaker 3>programs that Jimmy Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it drove them nuts and I found enjoyment</v>

296
00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:04.390
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

297
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

298
00:14:05.091 --> 00:14:06.790
<v Speaker 3>the further down that rabbit hole you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

299
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:09.430
<v Speaker 3>the more you read Milton Friedman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you understand the foundational</v>

300
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 3>principles and ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At a young age.</v>

301
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:14.680
<v Speaker 3>I just became on fire for politics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>for economics.</v>

302
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.513
<v Speaker 3>And Long Story Short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started this organization when I was </v>

303
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:21.670
<v Speaker 3>18 instead of going to college and ended</v>
<v Speaker 3>up being a wonderful decision and helped</v>

304
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.540
<v Speaker 3>really place myself in a movement that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was waiting to be grown.</v>

305
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.350
<v Speaker 3>And this is something a lot bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 3>just politics.</v>

306
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:30.483
<v Speaker 3>This is the fight for the soul of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country and it has to start on college </v>

307
00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:36.430
<v Speaker 3>campuses and it's really the struggle </v>
<v Speaker 3>for our generation and it's,</v>

308
00:14:36.431 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you divide it,</v>

309
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:38.614
<v Speaker 3>it's do we want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we believe America's the greatest </v>

310
00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 3>country in the history of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>do we believe freedom is a good thing or</v>

311
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:44.704
<v Speaker 3>do we want to go a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction that looks much more like a </v>

312
00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 3>European socialist democracy that does </v>
<v Speaker 3>not honor civil liberties,</v>

313
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 3>that does not honor private property and</v>
<v Speaker 3>really deteriorates everything that made</v>

314
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 3>America great place that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision our generation has to make.</v>

315
00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.673
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're sort of like the non Silicon </v>

316
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.600
<v Speaker 4>Valley version of like Bill Gates or </v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve Jobs,</v>

317
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.463
<v Speaker 4>the guy that didn't quite flattering but</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't go to college or dropped out of </v>

318
00:15:07.691 --> 00:15:10.990
<v Speaker 4>college and now you're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 4>college people.</v>

319
00:15:10.991 --> 00:15:14.470
<v Speaker 4>When did you realize that that was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>place that this battle had to be?</v>

320
00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:14.970
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

321
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.170
<v Speaker 3>The first couple of years of starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>turning point USA,</v>

322
00:15:17.171 --> 00:15:19.510
<v Speaker 3>it started as kind of a generic student </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization,</v>

323
00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:22.090
<v Speaker 3>but just like any good innovator and </v>
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneur.</v>

324
00:15:22.091 --> 00:15:22.924
<v Speaker 3>I listened and I learned and I realized </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was such frustration amongst self </v>

325
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:27.994
<v Speaker 3>identified conservative Libertarians on </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus that were not being properly </v>

326
00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:34.630
<v Speaker 3>channeled and organized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They felt as if they were being targeted</v>

327
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.080
<v Speaker 3>and that they were being suppressed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their ideas were not being allowed to be</v>

328
00:15:38.081 --> 00:15:40.210
<v Speaker 3>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we made a decision.</v>

329
00:15:40.211 --> 00:15:41.044
<v Speaker 3>That turning point after a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years is let's not just fight the </v>

330
00:15:43.211 --> 00:15:44.044
<v Speaker 3>political war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's double down and fight the culture </v>

331
00:15:45.491 --> 00:15:46.324
<v Speaker 3>war and that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can be the champions of free speech </v>

332
00:15:48.731 --> 00:15:50.740
<v Speaker 3>and we can be the ambassadors of </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>

333
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Where really you see these campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call them islands at totalitarianism.</v>

334
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:56.403
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their idea of diversity is a group of </v>

335
00:15:57.941 --> 00:16:00.550
<v Speaker 3>people that all look different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they think the same.</v>

336
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.773
<v Speaker 3>That's not diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so turning point has benefited </v>

337
00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:04.504
<v Speaker 3>tremendously over the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of really being the champions of </v>

338
00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:09.850
<v Speaker 3>free speech and also saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

339
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.830
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans were not conservatives.</v>

340
00:16:11.831 --> 00:16:13.570
<v Speaker 3>We're not libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can call us all that stuff.</v>

341
00:16:13.571 --> 00:16:14.404
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have members that are across that </v>

342
00:16:16.901 --> 00:16:19.360
<v Speaker 3>whole spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you believe in freedom,</v>

343
00:16:19.361 --> 00:16:21.460
<v Speaker 3>you believe America's a great country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Welcome aboard.</v>

344
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:26.460
<v Speaker 4>Do you think the idea of having that </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of wide tent is part of the appeal?</v>

345
00:16:26.461 --> 00:16:28.800
<v Speaker 4>Like I think people are so sick of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>labels and all that.</v>

346
00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:29.634
<v Speaker 4>Total is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spend actually most of the weekend </v>

347
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.120
<v Speaker 4>hanging out with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Austin.</v>

348
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.253
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but part of it also hanging out with </v>

349
00:16:34.951 --> 00:16:37.020
<v Speaker 4>Tommy and candace and a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people and I was like,</v>

350
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.550
<v Speaker 4>there really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

351
00:16:38.551 --> 00:16:39.600
<v Speaker 4>and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

352
00:16:39.601 --> 00:16:42.300
<v Speaker 4>Alison Stuckey was there and a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people and I was like,</v>

353
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:43.163
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people actually really do think </v>

354
00:16:44.491 --> 00:16:45.530
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

355
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.393
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and my libertarian side </v>
<v Speaker 4>usually goes to kind of where Austin's </v>

356
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.993
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>

357
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.040
<v Speaker 4>we were all having dinner after and </v>
<v Speaker 4>having some great thing.</v>

358
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.240
<v Speaker 4>Then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is great.</v>

359
00:16:54.241 --> 00:16:57.240
<v Speaker 4>We're having real discussions about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're really big and into this.</v>

360
00:16:57.241 --> 00:16:57.430
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

361
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.100
<v Speaker 3>And there is that disagreement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you put them all in a room,</v>

362
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:01.510
<v Speaker 3>they built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get the big stuff.</v>

363
00:17:01.511 --> 00:17:02.290
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

364
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.123
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we believe that free enterprise has </v>

365
00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:05.014
<v Speaker 3>been a net positive for humanity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we believe the constitution is a </v>

366
00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:09.340
<v Speaker 3>great political document that should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>preserved,</v>

367
00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:10.510
<v Speaker 3>protected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and better understood.</v>

368
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Do we believe America has been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful,</v>

369
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>net benefit for humanity.</v>

370
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:15.813
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the last 200 years they probably </v>

371
00:17:17.231 --> 00:17:19.900
<v Speaker 3>agreed wholeheartedly and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the other stuff where they start to</v>

372
00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:23.710
<v Speaker 3>have a little philosophical differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that disagreement is not being found</v>

373
00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:24.544
<v Speaker 3>on the left right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you disagree with one core tenant of </v>

374
00:17:27.641 --> 00:17:29.620
<v Speaker 3>leftist dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ostracized.</v>

375
00:17:29.621 --> 00:17:31.660
<v Speaker 3>You're kicked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that shows their,</v>

376
00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:34.030
<v Speaker 3>they're not a diverse political </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>

377
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.193
<v Speaker 3>The new modern American left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're extremely intolerant of </v>

378
00:17:37.841 --> 00:17:39.320
<v Speaker 3>differing opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't have to talk,</v>

379
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean I love this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let you take this day around my agent,</v>

380
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.820
<v Speaker 4>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would gladly,</v>

381
00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:45.710
<v Speaker 4>I said this when I had your online last </v>
<v Speaker 4>week,</v>

382
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 4>I will gladly give you the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech that I gave to you guys</v>

383
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.963
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to give that exact same </v>

384
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:56.100
<v Speaker 3>speech to any progressive or Democrat </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you guys are standing ovation,</v>

385
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to get with my maggot </v>
<v Speaker 3>hat wearing the students.</v>

386
00:17:59.101 --> 00:17:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

387
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.583
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you give that speech to the young </v>

388
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:03.114
<v Speaker 3>Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>socialists of America conference coming </v>

389
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:07.950
<v Speaker 3>up in a couple months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get booze and you'll get weak.</v>

390
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:09.810
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't hear things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We disagree with,</v>

391
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bolshevik,</v>

392
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

393
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:13.824
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people have have translated into </v>

394
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:17.124
<v Speaker 3>total authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see a moment where both of the </v>

395
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:21.384
<v Speaker 3>movements sort of where you would argue </v>
<v Speaker 3>the conservative sort of lost their </v>

396
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thus lost the culture war or,</v>

397
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.650
<v Speaker 3>and where the left Sorta went bananas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

398
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I think the [inaudible] has gone bananas</v>
<v Speaker 3>just by default of their positions.</v>

399
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:33.654
<v Speaker 3>They really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of every leftist is a </v>

400
00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:37.700
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

401
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:42.060
<v Speaker 3>screaming to get out is a great quote I </v>
<v Speaker 3>always use is because when you argue for</v>

402
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.073
<v Speaker 3>total government power and total </v>
<v Speaker 3>government control of health care in </v>

403
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:45.924
<v Speaker 3>schools and private economic decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can easily be translated into the </v>

404
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:53.130
<v Speaker 3>monitoring side of personal capacity </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions,</v>

405
00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:53.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

406
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.600
<v Speaker 3>That that translation is quite simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always say to a leftist that says,</v>

407
00:18:57.601 --> 00:18:58.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in,</v>

408
00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>civil liberties,</v>

409
00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 3>but I also believe in government run </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools and health care.</v>

410
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:02.514
<v Speaker 3>And as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't trust the government to </v>

411
00:19:04.471 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 3>help you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to monitor your own personal life,</v>

412
00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:07.224
<v Speaker 3>why on earth would you trust the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government to run all these other </v>

413
00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:09.204
<v Speaker 3>institutions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where I think conservatives have gotten </v>

414
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:15.600
<v Speaker 3>it wrong over the last 30 years is where</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives have become mislabeled and</v>

415
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:19.020
<v Speaker 3>sometimes some concerns of believe this </v>
<v Speaker 3>to want to do social engineering.</v>

416
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.300
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to have angelical </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian,</v>

417
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.163
<v Speaker 3>I'm a pro life conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also believe government should </v>

418
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:27.870
<v Speaker 3>have barriers and trying to instill </v>
<v Speaker 3>those values upon society.</v>

419
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:28.704
<v Speaker 3>I think the best persuasion in the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>capacity for good is done through </v>

420
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:32.394
<v Speaker 3>churches and local community movements </v>
<v Speaker 3>and individuals persuading individuals </v>

421
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:36.384
<v Speaker 3>and writing books and doing podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not through government doing massive </v>

422
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:40.320
<v Speaker 3>social engineering programs.</v>

423
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.470
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's where conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>have lost their way and that's where the</v>

424
00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 3>left is currently trying to stake their </v>
<v Speaker 3>claim.</v>

425
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything that you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>government does well?</v>

426
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.460
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

427
00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:54.990
<v Speaker 3>I think government is a necessary evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's necessary for providing for</v>

428
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:55.824
<v Speaker 3>the national defense because that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that whether we like it or </v>

429
00:19:58.051 --> 00:19:58.890
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>

430
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 3>you have to delegate some of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal freedom to,</v>

431
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>

432
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.540
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a civil society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But government by its essence,</v>

433
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.460
<v Speaker 3>if you read what Milton Friedman has </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

434
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.383
<v Speaker 3>they're incentivized to be inefficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're incentivized by definition to </v>

435
00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:17.841
<v Speaker 3>not be able to provide the best possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>good or service for the individual.</v>

436
00:20:18.181 --> 00:20:19.014
<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the private sector does everything </v>

437
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:20.994
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it be the inefficiency of the </v>

438
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:22.374
<v Speaker 3>post office or a Medicare is bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Social Security doesn't serve the </v>

439
00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:25.880
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

440
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 3>effectively everything government </v>
<v Speaker 3>touches goes to crap.</v>

441
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.873
<v Speaker 3>And the private sector is by definition </v>
<v Speaker 3>more efficient because if you don't do </v>

442
00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:34.440
<v Speaker 3>it well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to exist much longer.</v>

443
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.310
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is the best way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting that message across then?</v>

444
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:39.144
<v Speaker 3>Government just doesn't do things well </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I think it's just so built into </v>

445
00:20:41.881 --> 00:20:45.720
<v Speaker 3>people partly because our education is </v>
<v Speaker 3>term screwed up or whatever,</v>

446
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.120
<v Speaker 3>that they just feel the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>should just do things.</v>

447
00:20:49.121 --> 00:20:49.954
<v Speaker 3>So I saw Bernie tweeted the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this video of all these millionaires </v>

448
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I responded and so I retweeted it,</v>

449
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 3>which got like 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we read tweets because it was like,</v>

450
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.480
<v Speaker 3>it's all these millionaires saying we </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be taxed more.</v>

451
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:03.160
<v Speaker 3>We should be taxed more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

452
00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.860
<v Speaker 3>what's a lectural hippocrates such lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

453
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:06.221
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

454
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:09.880
<v Speaker 3>what's stopping you from paying more </v>
<v Speaker 3>money to the irs?</v>

455
00:21:09.881 --> 00:21:11.070
<v Speaker 3>Numb scores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

456
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but okay,</v>

457
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:14.044
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet Bernie's tweet get something </v>

458
00:21:15.131 --> 00:21:16.510
<v Speaker 3>like 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>retweets.</v>

459
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.580
<v Speaker 3>And not that it's all about retweets and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>

460
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:20.710
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has high engagement with this.</v>

461
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.150
<v Speaker 3>But to me it's just lazy thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that is lazy.</v>

462
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 3>So virtuous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's so virtuous to keep giving money</v>

463
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 3>to the guts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

464
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.810
<v Speaker 3>Why do you need the government to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to do it?</v>

465
00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:29.983
<v Speaker 3>And really at its core,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the philosophical </v>

466
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 3>difference between really the culturally</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxists left,</v>

467
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:37.720
<v Speaker 3>which is what they're becoming and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>free thinking,</v>

468
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:38.800
<v Speaker 3>individualistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

469
00:21:38.801 --> 00:21:40.570
<v Speaker 3>individual Libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative,</v>

470
00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:41.404
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is the new intellectual position </v>

471
00:21:43.451 --> 00:21:44.620
<v Speaker 3>that is growing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

472
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.520
<v Speaker 3>quicker than even the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

473
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.690
<v Speaker 3>we might want good things to happen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>

474
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.560
<v Speaker 3>but don't tell me to do them at gunpoint</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the left on the other hand,</v>

475
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't think their intentions are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

476
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:56.650
<v Speaker 3>I think they want permanent political </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

477
00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.310
<v Speaker 3>But Bernie Sanders for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is so convicted that he is right.</v>

478
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.143
<v Speaker 3>He wants to use the absolute authority </v>
<v Speaker 3>on and unlimited power of the state to </v>

479
00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:06.964
<v Speaker 3>put a gun to your head and say you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a 70% tax rate because someone </v>

480
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:11.374
<v Speaker 3>is starving on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would rather live in a society that </v>

481
00:22:13.241 --> 00:22:16.840
<v Speaker 3>has the same tax rate for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10% and we dig deep.</v>

482
00:22:16.841 --> 00:22:18.340
<v Speaker 3>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we going to take care of that person</v>

483
00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 3>on the street through charity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through private philanthropy and through</v>

484
00:22:21.221 --> 00:22:22.054
<v Speaker 3>being better people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at when socialism's </v>

485
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.413
<v Speaker 3>implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the moral disintegration of </v>

486
00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at Spain,</v>

487
00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 3>you look at France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at Europe,</v>

488
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.420
<v Speaker 3>they don't have anything as private </v>
<v Speaker 3>philanthropy anymore.</v>

489
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.293
<v Speaker 3>Private charity has disappeared and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe because government takes care of </v>

490
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:37.354
<v Speaker 3>it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that is such an important point </v>

491
00:22:38.981 --> 00:22:39.431
<v Speaker 3>to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

492
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:40.264
<v Speaker 3>going back to your question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you illustrate this to a young </v>

493
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 3>person?</v>

494
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.060
<v Speaker 3>You ask the fundamental question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you trust the government?</v>

495
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:49.730
<v Speaker 3>That word trust is so important because </v>
<v Speaker 3>then in that word trust,</v>

496
00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:51.220
<v Speaker 3>that really feels personal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

497
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Do you trust the government?</v>
<v Speaker 3>99% of young people will say no.</v>

498
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.833
<v Speaker 3>Then you ask the next question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then why do you want to make government </v>

499
00:22:57.761 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 3>bigger as soon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'll say,</v>

500
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:01.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then you're not a social,</v>

501
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:01.924
<v Speaker 3>so you're not a leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then let's talk about how we can really </v>

502
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:09.520
<v Speaker 3>shrink the size of government and put </v>
<v Speaker 3>power back into the the hands of people.</v>

503
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.563
<v Speaker 3>And it's important to note also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you think government white </v>

504
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:13.174
<v Speaker 3>want might want to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean federal government has </v>

505
00:23:14.591 --> 00:23:15.424
<v Speaker 3>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Local government is much more </v>

506
00:23:17.531 --> 00:23:18.364
<v Speaker 3>accountable to the citizens than some </v>
<v Speaker 3>bureaucrat in d c that you're never </v>

507
00:23:21.431 --> 00:23:23.110
<v Speaker 3>going to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so those are,</v>

508
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:24.340
<v Speaker 3>those are arguments that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

509
00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:25.370
<v Speaker 3>we found to be very effective.</v>

510
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting you mentioned </v>

511
00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:31.240
<v Speaker 3>intentions and I always try my best not </v>
<v Speaker 3>to impune intentions of others.</v>

512
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.340
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially on the left right now,</v>

513
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.460
<v Speaker 3>obviously I think these people have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of bad ideas now.</v>

514
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them have bad intentions,</v>

515
00:23:38.801 --> 00:23:39.634
<v Speaker 3>but most of them don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most average people don't wake up </v>

516
00:23:41.111 --> 00:23:44.300
<v Speaker 3>thinking I'm going to do bad today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually think they're doing good.</v>

517
00:23:44.301 --> 00:23:45.134
<v Speaker 3>They most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

518
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Do you think some of their leaders </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually have bad intentions?</v>

519
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

520
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.020
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not all of them,</v>

521
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:51.883
<v Speaker 3>but some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you look back to the original </v>

522
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:54.134
<v Speaker 3>writings and the original thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>process behind the great society and </v>

523
00:23:56.911 --> 00:23:57.744
<v Speaker 3>Lyndon Baines Johnson who bragged on </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple times that the implementation </v>

524
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 3>of the great society and all the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs around it,</v>

525
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.823
<v Speaker 3>we'll keep African Americans dependent </v>
<v Speaker 3>and keep them voting for generations </v>

526
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 3>documented in the presidential record.</v>

527
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:08.983
<v Speaker 3>Lyndon Baines Johnson said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think the Democratic Party is </v>

528
00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:12.344
<v Speaker 3>full of people with great intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but its leaders have realized and </v>

529
00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:16.124
<v Speaker 3>calculated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they can keep the government </v>

530
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:20.210
<v Speaker 3>programs continuing for just long </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

531
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.253
<v Speaker 3>not getting people out of poverty but </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep people survive and within poverty </v>

532
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.550
<v Speaker 3>they will have a permanent political </v>
<v Speaker 3>base.</v>

533
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:26.563
<v Speaker 3>So if you ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if African Americans actually rose out </v>

534
00:24:29.211 --> 00:24:30.044
<v Speaker 3>of poverty and saw their wages get </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher and their schools get better and </v>

535
00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:34.260
<v Speaker 3>their communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

536
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:35.263
<v Speaker 3>flourish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they going to keep voting for </v>

537
00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:39.500
<v Speaker 3>government welfare programs that are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>basis of the Democratic Party?</v>

538
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>

539
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:41.804
<v Speaker 3>They're going to break out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the intentions of the </v>

540
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the followers,</v>

541
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:45.554
<v Speaker 3>I'm never ever going to impugn them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to call them deplorables </v>

542
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:48.134
<v Speaker 3>or anything like they call us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most of the followers of </v>

543
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:51.200
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party actually really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

544
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:52.183
<v Speaker 3>but the leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we must question their motives because </v>

545
00:24:53.661 --> 00:24:58.130
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the failures of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>welfare system in this country,</v>

546
00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.113
<v Speaker 3>it is undoubtable that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting a system that benefits them </v>

547
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 3>politically.</v>

548
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.570
<v Speaker 4>Is this also a partly why the media is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going so hysterical right now?</v>

549
00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:06.404
<v Speaker 4>Like have you noticed just in the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of weeks we've shifted a little </v>

550
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:09.614
<v Speaker 4>bit out of Russia hysteria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now it's about trump's mental </v>

551
00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:13.064
<v Speaker 4>capacity and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like you can see how they </v>

552
00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:15.260
<v Speaker 4>coordinate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

553
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 4>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you just look,</v>

554
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 4>you can see you,</v>

555
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.100
<v Speaker 3>they got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got like a group text message chain</v>

556
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:19.881
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

557
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:22.610
<v Speaker 3>they got like John King,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon,</v>

558
00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Rachel maddow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're all just group texting.</v>

559
00:25:24.681 --> 00:25:26.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to have that fear down,</v>

560
00:25:26.481 --> 00:25:28.060
<v Speaker 3>that conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you give me,</v>

561
00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:28.983
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you start to have all three </v>

562
00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:32.930
<v Speaker 3>television stations open of CBS this </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning and CNN,</v>

563
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Cuomo and MSNBC,</v>

564
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.190
<v Speaker 3>morning Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're talking about the exact same</v>

565
00:25:37.191 --> 00:25:38.024
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally the segments are literally </v>

566
00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:41.170
<v Speaker 3>produced the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's a conspiracy.</v>

567
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.133
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be some sort of talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>points memo they send out early in the </v>

568
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.973
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but does that actually you were talking </v>

569
00:25:46.221 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 3>points memo or just general group thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

570
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it's general group thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also,</v>

571
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:52.460
<v Speaker 3>I think they understand that they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be coordinated to be effective,</v>

572
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:55.310
<v Speaker 3>which there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

573
00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Effectively we conserve it as do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing without even realizing it.</v>

574
00:25:58.581 --> 00:25:59.414
<v Speaker 3>You listened to rush Limbaugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you listened to Dennis prager and you </v>

575
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:01.514
<v Speaker 3>listen to Sean Hannity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The talking points are usually quite </v>

576
00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:04.604
<v Speaker 3>similar because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you watch Fox and friends in the </v>

577
00:26:06.171 --> 00:26:07.004
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of sets the agenda and I'm </v>

578
00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:08.744
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not attacking the Democrats for </v>

579
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:10.544
<v Speaker 3>being that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at why the media is </v>

580
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:13.904
<v Speaker 3>going so far off the rails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's they will never accept the fact </v>

581
00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:17.924
<v Speaker 3>that this presidency is actually large.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In part a wonderful success is that the </v>

582
00:26:21.201 --> 00:26:24.110
<v Speaker 3>president is fulfilling his campaign </v>
<v Speaker 3>promises.</v>

583
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.183
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing unprecedented economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosperity and you're seeing people's </v>

584
00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:28.934
<v Speaker 3>lives actually get better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they have to go down to this </v>

585
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:33.710
<v Speaker 3>tabloid journalism and report on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake book.</v>

586
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:34.843
<v Speaker 3>They have to continue down this Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>hysteria because if this president </v>

587
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:39.380
<v Speaker 3>succeeds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he is,</v>

588
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:41.750
<v Speaker 3>and he will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else do they have?</v>

589
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:46.410
<v Speaker 3>They have gone so far in that this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a psychopathic nutjob.</v>

590
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.483
<v Speaker 3>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will lose all institutional </v>

591
00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:50.100
<v Speaker 3>credibility and political relevance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

592
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:53.100
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when trump started the campaign,</v>

593
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.090
<v Speaker 3>I kept saying that if you keep calling </v>
<v Speaker 3>this Guy Hitler,</v>

594
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.143
<v Speaker 3>you are painting yourself into a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad quarter and it cheapens Hitler to </v>

595
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.223
<v Speaker 3>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler's was one of the worst mass </v>

596
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:06.300
<v Speaker 3>murderers in human history who killed 15</v>
<v Speaker 3>million people,</v>

597
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.390
<v Speaker 3>and they have people once a week on </v>
<v Speaker 3>those networks,</v>

598
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.880
<v Speaker 3>equate him to the rise of the Third </v>
<v Speaker 3>Reich.</v>

599
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:16.710
<v Speaker 3>What does that do is it cheapens the </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil of Hitler and isn't that one of the</v>

600
00:27:16.711 --> 00:27:17.544
<v Speaker 3>worst things you could possibly do when </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to educate the next </v>

601
00:27:18.991 --> 00:27:19.970
<v Speaker 3>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's Hitler,</v>

602
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:20.843
<v Speaker 3>no one's Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then maybe what Hitler did wasn't that </v>

603
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:22.824
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Hitler was democratically elected </v>

604
00:27:23.761 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 3>and had a supreme court that kept them </v>
<v Speaker 3>in balance.</v>

605
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:26.723
<v Speaker 3>You see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it cheapens the evil of the Nazi </v>

606
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 3>empire when they start to make these </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparisons to Donald Trump and Hitler.</v>

607
00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:35.043
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also the way this stuff just goes </v>

608
00:27:37.051 --> 00:27:37.890
<v Speaker 3>downstream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

609
00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:40.740
<v Speaker 3>because then it's you start calling all </v>
<v Speaker 3>your intellectual opponents Nazis.</v>

610
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to punch Nazis.</v>

611
00:27:42.391 --> 00:27:43.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where does that end?</v>

612
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.110
<v Speaker 3>Can we punch the knots and like life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we blow up their car?</v>

613
00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:46.944
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm called a Nazi all the time and I </v>

614
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:49.884
<v Speaker 3>mean it's one of the most intellectually</v>
<v Speaker 3>just dangerous arguments to make when </v>

615
00:27:53.791 --> 00:27:54.624
<v Speaker 3>you and when everyone becomes a fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though there is no evidence of </v>

616
00:27:58.051 --> 00:27:58.884
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What really has your political movement </v>

617
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:02.040
<v Speaker 3>become?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

618
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Where'd the words freedom and liberty </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the words that I now use a lot,</v>

619
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:12.240
<v Speaker 3>how did they get so mucked up that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>started feeling wrong?</v>

620
00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:12.900
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

621
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.240
<v Speaker 3>Or the cultural relevance of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

622
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.103
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's starting with the </v>

623
00:28:17.101 --> 00:28:19.530
<v Speaker 3>misrepresentation of what freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberty really is.</v>

624
00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:20.364
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left tries to be the movement of </v>

625
00:28:21.661 --> 00:28:23.790
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of young people that follow Bernie</v>

626
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Sanders actually think they're on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>side of freedom.</v>

627
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:26.843
<v Speaker 3>They think that Bernie Sanders is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting for political freedom and </v>

628
00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:31.830
<v Speaker 3>economic freedom and that he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight for the little guy.</v>

629
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.770
<v Speaker 3>When in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when his ideas are implemented,</v>

630
00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:35.604
<v Speaker 3>which he's an open socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the power always gets concentrated at </v>

631
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:41.670
<v Speaker 3>the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rulers are the ones that get rich.</v>

632
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.710
<v Speaker 3>The people that have the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>connections,</v>

633
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 3>the best lobbyists are the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit tremendously.</v>

634
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.083
<v Speaker 3>You look no further than Venezuela or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuba or anywhere we're socialism has </v>

635
00:28:51.121 --> 00:28:51.954
<v Speaker 3>tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the poor people that voted these </v>

636
00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:55.770
<v Speaker 3>guys in the power that get that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst off.</v>

637
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.020
<v Speaker 3>And so we have to be able to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

638
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Freedom is not only a really cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom is not only a great idea,</v>

639
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.353
<v Speaker 3>but it actually works like freedom when </v>
<v Speaker 3>implemented actually makes people's </v>

640
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:07.690
<v Speaker 3>lives better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

641
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.920
<v Speaker 3>freedom would be a difficult argument if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not only like really cool to make</v>

642
00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:11.754
<v Speaker 3>the argument like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

643
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.410
<v Speaker 3>you can do whatever you want to do when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to do it,</v>

644
00:29:13.411 --> 00:29:14.640
<v Speaker 3>how you want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be great.</v>

645
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.670
<v Speaker 3>But we actually get to make the argument</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in practicality,</v>

646
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:22.470
<v Speaker 3>freedom is the greatest thing to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's lives better for innovations,</v>

647
00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:24.690
<v Speaker 3>for medical advances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for technological,</v>

648
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosperity.</v>

649
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Nothing comes even close to allowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom to,</v>

650
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 3>to ensue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you say when someone says,</v>

651
00:29:32.461 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear this all the time.</v>

652
00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:34.021
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

653
00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:35.670
<v Speaker 3>if the government doesn't do these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

654
00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:36.504
<v Speaker 3>these social programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or if the government takes away food </v>

655
00:29:38.881 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 3>stamps or whatever it is that just don't</v>

656
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.090
<v Speaker 4>know if the private sector or churches </v>
<v Speaker 4>and synagogues,</v>

657
00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:46.924
<v Speaker 4>whatever else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just don't know that that will pick </v>

658
00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:51.460
<v Speaker 4>up the slack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if that doesn't happen,</v>

659
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.270
<v Speaker 4>we end up with this permanent class of </v>
<v Speaker 4>under,</v>

660
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

661
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.910
<v Speaker 4>economically underserved people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have no way</v>

662
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.360
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is where the world views,</v>

663
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.210
<v Speaker 3>I think collide is where the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they try to build this.</v>

664
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.750
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of it is trying for guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

665
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.160
<v Speaker 3>They actually want to help as many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people as possible.</v>

666
00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:14.080
<v Speaker 3>They feel so bad that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>

667
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:15.460
<v Speaker 3>They want someone else to do it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

668
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.250
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing I do is I challenge </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

669
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.610
<v Speaker 3>How much money are you giving to </v>
<v Speaker 3>charity?</v>

670
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:19.683
<v Speaker 3>How much are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually helped the homeless guy in the </v>

671
00:30:20.951 --> 00:30:21.784
<v Speaker 3>side corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what if 10 million people did </v>

672
00:30:23.141 --> 00:30:24.460
<v Speaker 3>what you did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Secondly,</v>

673
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.443
<v Speaker 3>never underestimate the good that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans will do when people are in </v>

674
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:30.130
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hurricanes,</v>

675
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:32.950
<v Speaker 3>natural disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>famines fires.</v>

676
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.873
<v Speaker 3>Americans always step up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans voluntarily gave $500 billion </v>

677
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:39.790
<v Speaker 3>away to charity last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if our tax rate was 10%.</v>

678
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:40.803
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if there was really a national </v>
<v Speaker 3>rallying call to double our charitable </v>

679
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:43.690
<v Speaker 3>efforts.</v>

680
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.340
<v Speaker 3>We can easily get away trillions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

681
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:46.630
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trillions of dollars.</v>

682
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:47.613
<v Speaker 3>That's the size of the welfare state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would make a compelling argument </v>

683
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.550
<v Speaker 3>that local churches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>charities,</v>

684
00:30:51.551 --> 00:30:52.384
<v Speaker 3>and municipalities do a heck of a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>better job of serving the people than </v>

685
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 3>the federal government bureaucrat a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

686
00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sending money to Washington DC,</v>

687
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 3>is that actually going to help the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>single mother and Miami or it's going to</v>

688
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:05.110
<v Speaker 3>the local Catholic Church and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>$5,000</v>

689
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.093
<v Speaker 3>which might be a lot of money to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually going to help them a lot more </v>

690
00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:09.910
<v Speaker 3>than sending that $5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Washington DC.</v>

691
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I will argue fiercely against someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who says that a government bureaucrat is</v>

692
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:18.490
<v Speaker 3>going to help an underprivileged </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual better than a private charity</v>

693
00:31:18.491 --> 00:31:20.020
<v Speaker 3>or individuals helping individuals.</v>

694
00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.180
<v Speaker 4>So you said a couple nice things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump.</v>

695
00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:26.140
<v Speaker 4>So I want to get into some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the specifics on that please.</v>

696
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.073
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so one of the things that I've said is </v>

697
00:31:28.341 --> 00:31:29.174
<v Speaker 4>that trump basically was the bull in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>China shop and he just went in and just </v>

698
00:31:32.511 --> 00:31:33.344
<v Speaker 4>up and did everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I actually think that right now </v>

699
00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:35.983
<v Speaker 4>that's a net good because there were a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of bad things happening before and </v>

700
00:31:38.571 --> 00:31:40.490
<v Speaker 4>there's some fertile ground for good </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

701
00:31:40.491 --> 00:31:41.940
<v Speaker 4>So on that level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

702
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.053
<v Speaker 4>for what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I had Eric Weinstein sitting in </v>

703
00:31:45.021 --> 00:31:45.854
<v Speaker 4>that chair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said that he would have preferred it </v>

704
00:31:46.851 --> 00:31:47.684
<v Speaker 4>to be a panther and a China shop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning it would have just knocked over </v>

705
00:31:50.301 --> 00:31:51.650
<v Speaker 4>a few things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe not the old.</v>

706
00:31:51.651 --> 00:31:53.590
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that that exists.</v>

707
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.520
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the point of our disagreement.</v>

708
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:56.443
<v Speaker 4>I just think it just doesn't exist where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to selectively choose which </v>

709
00:31:59.631 --> 00:32:02.660
<v Speaker 4>things are going to be knocked off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shelves and all that.</v>

710
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.290
<v Speaker 4>Seb Gorka was speaking at the turning </v>
<v Speaker 4>point event.</v>

711
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's here.</v>

712
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.473
<v Speaker 4>He really Gutfeld is doing this whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing about how he sounds like somebody </v>

713
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.110
<v Speaker 4>was doing it on status can stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

714
00:32:15.111 --> 00:32:15.944
<v Speaker 4>but Corco was saying how trump was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he said the icebreaker going </v>

715
00:32:19.131 --> 00:32:20.840
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The glacier basically.</v>

716
00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.810
<v Speaker 4>And what I noticed though is there was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>theme with the speakers.</v>

717
00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:27.830
<v Speaker 4>Were everyone basically acknowledged </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there are issues with trump.</v>

718
00:32:27.831 --> 00:32:28.664
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anyone went up there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>said this guy is the perfect thing or </v>

719
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is exactly how we wanted it.</v>

720
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:38.330
<v Speaker 4>But there was a sense of this was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>only way it could have happened.</v>

721
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.970
<v Speaker 4>Is that where you would,</v>

722
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.070
<v Speaker 3>so I'm one of the few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

723
00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.580
<v Speaker 3>outward and vocal millennial trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters out there.</v>

724
00:32:45.581 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Not few I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And kind of this word world,</v>

725
00:32:47.781 --> 00:32:50.830
<v Speaker 3>the conservative punditry if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone tries to hedge,</v>

726
00:32:50.831 --> 00:32:51.664
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's some good and some bad and </v>

727
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.463
<v Speaker 3>I've obviously gone all in and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad I have and I'm happy to walk </v>

728
00:32:55.661 --> 00:32:56.560
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

729
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.090
<v Speaker 3>the philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

730
00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:58.953
<v Speaker 3>reasoning for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So look like Donald Trump was never </v>

731
00:33:02.141 --> 00:33:03.700
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>

732
00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.480
<v Speaker 3>me just look going back a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>running in a crowded field of republican</v>

733
00:33:07.481 --> 00:33:10.900
<v Speaker 3>candidates and announcing the day after </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeb Bush announced his candidacy,</v>

734
00:33:10.901 --> 00:33:11.734
<v Speaker 3>which I think was no coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think he saw Jeb Bush announced </v>

735
00:33:13.871 --> 00:33:15.050
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screw it if that guy's running.</v>

736
00:33:15.051 --> 00:33:15.884
<v Speaker 3>Government took down the Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dynasty that out $110 million to spend </v>

737
00:33:18.851 --> 00:33:19.684
<v Speaker 3>and then took down the Clinton dynasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took down the media dynasty in a way </v>

738
00:33:22.061 --> 00:33:26.560
<v Speaker 3>that's totally unprecedented and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the values that he represents,</v>

739
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:27.543
<v Speaker 3>in my personal opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is one of the best chances Western </v>

740
00:33:30.611 --> 00:33:32.110
<v Speaker 3>civilization has to continue.</v>

741
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.630
<v Speaker 3>He believes America's the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>country in the history of the world.</v>

742
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.330
<v Speaker 3>He's been a fierce critic of socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has visit this.</v>

743
00:33:37.331 --> 00:33:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Poland was a 40 minute critique of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall of the USSR.</v>

744
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:43.263
<v Speaker 3>He believes that the constitution is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest political document ever </v>

745
00:33:45.701 --> 00:33:46.534
<v Speaker 3>written.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look no further than his appointment of </v>

746
00:33:47.411 --> 00:33:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Gorsuch and the circuit court judges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more than any of that,</v>

747
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:53.680
<v Speaker 3>he believes that America as an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be preserved,</v>

748
00:33:53.681 --> 00:33:54.820
<v Speaker 3>protected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and advanced.</v>

749
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.070
<v Speaker 3>And is he an imperfect vessel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

750
00:33:57.071 --> 00:33:57.904
<v Speaker 3>we're all imperfect vessels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does he tweet things that I might not </v>

751
00:34:00.191 --> 00:34:01.060
<v Speaker 3>always agree with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

752
00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:02.230
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

753
00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.290
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is that he's implementing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would make a compelling argument.</v>

754
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.870
<v Speaker 3>He's the most conservative president in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred years,</v>

755
00:34:07.871 --> 00:34:08.704
<v Speaker 3>even more so than Ronald Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is doing more bold reforms and he's </v>

756
00:34:11.501 --> 00:34:12.334
<v Speaker 3>fighting to do what he said he was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do even in the face of unprecedented </v>

757
00:34:16.481 --> 00:34:17.314
<v Speaker 3>opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it be the embassy moving to </v>

758
00:34:18.341 --> 00:34:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opening up our natural resources,</v>

759
00:34:20.921 --> 00:34:21.754
<v Speaker 3>getting out of TPP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting out of the Paris climate court </v>

760
00:34:23.831 --> 00:34:24.664
<v Speaker 3>agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is stuff that is not supposed to </v>

761
00:34:26.381 --> 00:34:27.340
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

762
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Do you think Jeb Bush would be doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this then and give me a break?</v>

763
00:34:29.861 --> 00:34:30.590
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

764
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.423
<v Speaker 4>so basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think he was the last chance for </v>

765
00:34:33.531 --> 00:34:34.364
<v Speaker 4>conservatives say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I kind of think that's a compelling </v>

766
00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:40.640
<v Speaker 4>argument that know that if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when mccain ran or Romney ran,</v>

767
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Speaker 4>Romney was against women with his </v>
<v Speaker 4>binders of women.</v>

768
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.933
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

769
00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 4>mccain was racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

770
00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:46.070
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

771
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.903
<v Speaker 4>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most compelling argument is that </v>

772
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.230
<v Speaker 4>none of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think Marco Rubio wouldn't be a brow</v>

773
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:52.064
<v Speaker 4>beat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary or Jeb would have somehow beat </v>

774
00:34:53.331 --> 00:34:54.164
<v Speaker 4>Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that putting aside some of my </v>

775
00:34:55.911 --> 00:34:56.744
<v Speaker 4>reservations for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was the only way that any of these </v>

776
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:01.100
<v Speaker 4>ideas we're going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

777
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.840
<v Speaker 3>that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we play out the alternative scenario.</v>

778
00:35:03.841 --> 00:35:04.674
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton is president and she has</v>
<v Speaker 3>control of the Senate and control the </v>

779
00:35:07.741 --> 00:35:08.574
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's just advancing this radically </v>

780
00:35:10.081 --> 00:35:12.510
<v Speaker 3>destructive Obama agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead,</v>

781
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.733
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for any of the disagreements people </v>

782
00:35:15.301 --> 00:35:16.134
<v Speaker 3>might have around him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the results really speak for themselves </v>

783
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.303
<v Speaker 3>and the economic prosperity that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing right now that you can the $6 </v>

784
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.030
<v Speaker 3>trillion of new wealth created in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

785
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.920
<v Speaker 3>But even more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

786
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.830
<v Speaker 3>there was a referendum on the ballot and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there and Wisconsin.</v>

787
00:35:28.831 --> 00:35:29.664
<v Speaker 3>I was there in Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there in Pennsylvania with Donald </v>

788
00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:31.763
<v Speaker 3>Trump jr for weeks on end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that showed up to vote that </v>

789
00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.673
<v Speaker 3>vote in 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what they were really voting </v>

790
00:35:36.631 --> 00:35:37.464
<v Speaker 3>for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were voting that America is the </v>

791
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 3>greatest country in the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

792
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:41.154
<v Speaker 3>And here's finally someone who is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fiercely defend it against the </v>

793
00:35:43.681 --> 00:35:44.970
<v Speaker 3>permanent political class.</v>

794
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:48.540
<v Speaker 3>That's important because who else to </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent that permanent political class</v>

795
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:49.374
<v Speaker 3>than Hillary Clinton?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was the worst person the Democrats </v>

796
00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:52.464
<v Speaker 3>could have put up in a change election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's someone who's husband was </v>

797
00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:57.000
<v Speaker 3>impeached,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who constantly cheated on her.</v>

798
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 3>She's the most uncharismatic possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>person to put up and here's a guy who,</v>

799
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:03.360
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to blow it up.</v>

800
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's who I'm gonna vote for.</v>

801
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.083
<v Speaker 3>And you look a lot of what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's sure he has shrunk the size of a </v>

802
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:10.044
<v Speaker 3>lot of these federal bureaucracies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fighting a lot of these entrenched </v>

803
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.780
<v Speaker 3>media and political establishments that </v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

804
00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:18.030
<v Speaker 3>I never thought we would see such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion against,</v>

805
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.510
<v Speaker 3>which brings me great satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about the intellectual</v>

806
00:36:21.511 --> 00:36:22.344
<v Speaker 3>side of trump?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I get what you're saying that the </v>

807
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 3>broad ideas of freedom to in America and</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberty and those things,</v>

808
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:30.330
<v Speaker 3>and I basically agree that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does understand those things.</v>

809
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.870
<v Speaker 3>In terms of just like the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 3>or philosophical side,</v>

810
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.733
<v Speaker 3>do you think he really has an </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the issues or do you </v>

811
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:39.390
<v Speaker 3>think that may be isn't even important?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's that important.</v>

812
00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:42.300
<v Speaker 3>I've spent considerable time with him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and his family and I can say this,</v>

813
00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.413
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his understanding of why America's the </v>

814
00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:47.280
<v Speaker 3>greatest country in the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

815
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:51.140
<v Speaker 3>why free enterprise matters and actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to benefit country as a whole is,</v>

816
00:36:51.141 --> 00:36:51.974
<v Speaker 3>is just as good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not better than some of these </v>

817
00:36:53.251 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 3>politicians and might be able to recite </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these intellectual and philosophical</v>

818
00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:58.650
<v Speaker 3>quotes because this is a president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>

819
00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.513
<v Speaker 3>He's been through bankruptcy trials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been through hiring and firing </v>

820
00:37:02.101 --> 00:37:02.934
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you running a business and me running a </v>

821
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 3>business that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that develops character in someone.</v>

822
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:07.854
<v Speaker 3>You just got to say making payroll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with regulators minus versus </v>

823
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:12.870
<v Speaker 3>some of these senators that have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

824
00:37:12.871 --> 00:37:14.490
<v Speaker 3>orders and thinkers their whole life.</v>

825
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Give me a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

826
00:37:15.391 --> 00:37:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have a deep amount of respect.</v>

827
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:18.960
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't bother me that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

828
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:19.621
<v Speaker 3>CNN says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

829
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:21.780
<v Speaker 3>we talks at a fourth grade level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me a break.</v>

830
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:22.763
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

831
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.633
<v Speaker 3>he talks the way that the guy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>northeast Iowa has been waiting for </v>

832
00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:27.204
<v Speaker 3>someone to talk to in awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I completely dismissed that as an </v>

833
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:30.414
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I look at what he's accomplished as </v>

834
00:37:31.861 --> 00:37:32.694
<v Speaker 3>a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is totally amazing and what he's </v>

835
00:37:34.561 --> 00:37:38.370
<v Speaker 3>fighting for every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he gets the big stuff correct.</v>

836
00:37:38.371 --> 00:37:39.660
<v Speaker 3>He really does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

837
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.450
<v Speaker 3>and I challenged them on my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

838
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:42.323
<v Speaker 3>critics on the right who else in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>field of 17 Republican candidates would </v>

839
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:49.110
<v Speaker 3>have nominated gorsuch to the supreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>court move the embassy advocated for the</v>

840
00:37:49.111 --> 00:37:49.881
<v Speaker 3>greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

841
00:37:49.881 --> 00:37:52.170
<v Speaker 3>middle class tax cut and American </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

842
00:37:52.171 --> 00:37:54.150
<v Speaker 3>not back down on some of these core </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

843
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.250
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I would have said,</v>

844
00:37:56.251 --> 00:37:58.620
<v Speaker 3>here's Xyz candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just pretend this is,</v>

845
00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Republican primary and in the </v>

846
00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:04.350
<v Speaker 3>first 11 months we'd get this done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most conservative pundits would say,</v>

847
00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:05.370
<v Speaker 3>we're at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do I sign?</v>

848
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

849
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>

850
00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:08.364
<v Speaker 3>he has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has advanced more conservative pro </v>

851
00:38:09.901 --> 00:38:10.734
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarian ideas then any of these </v>

852
00:38:12.571 --> 00:38:14.160
<v Speaker 3>candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what most of these candidates would.</v>

853
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:17.340
<v Speaker 3>So then what do you make of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative class that hates him?</v>

854
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.280
<v Speaker 3>So I'm talking about like the David from</v>
<v Speaker 3>crew,</v>

855
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:21.143
<v Speaker 3>that that whole French,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of these guys that really just </v>

856
00:38:24.331 --> 00:38:25.164
<v Speaker 3>hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though I agree he has put forth a </v>

857
00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:28.524
<v Speaker 3>lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they've been yammering about </v>

858
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.350
<v Speaker 3>for the last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

859
00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:31.960
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

860
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.793
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of respect for those </v>

861
00:38:34.141 --> 00:38:36.910
<v Speaker 3>publications of their history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

862
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm challenged to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

863
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm really wondering is it a personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>vendetta they have against this guy?</v>

864
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Is it a personality disagreement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because policywise and implementation of</v>

865
00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:48.040
<v Speaker 3>the people he's put in place to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions,</v>

866
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:48.903
<v Speaker 3>the cabinet positions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a much more conservative </v>

867
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:52.234
<v Speaker 3>president of the George W.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush and remarkably more effective than </v>

868
00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:54.964
<v Speaker 3>hw and already in 12 months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more consequential than Ronald </v>

869
00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.091
<v Speaker 3>Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

870
00:38:59.091 --> 00:38:59.900
<v Speaker 3>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

871
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I w w the ball's in their court,</v>

872
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.093
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because to be so hypercritical just </v>

873
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:06.094
<v Speaker 3>automatically against someone who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting for your ideas every single </v>

874
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.491
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

875
00:39:09.491 --> 00:39:10.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

876
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm really wondering why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it a personality,</v>

877
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:16.210
<v Speaker 3>this agreement or is it kind of just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be wrong type of thing.</v>

878
00:39:16.211 --> 00:39:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm cheering for his demise cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a po up opposed him for so long.</v>

879
00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:22.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to be liked by mainstream,</v>

880
00:39:22.001 --> 00:39:23.050
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the other thing,</v>

881
00:39:23.051 --> 00:39:24.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

882
00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 3>I've now created a whole new form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>enemies I never thought possible,</v>

883
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:29.830
<v Speaker 3>which is like these rabbit welcome to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

884
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:30.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

885
00:39:30.451 --> 00:39:32.500
<v Speaker 3>like these rabid media leads that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

886
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:33.850
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's close to the trump people.</v>

887
00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:35.410
<v Speaker 3>We must try to destroy him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

888
00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:36.130
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

889
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.300
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

890
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 3>and the hatred for this man is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is uncalled for.</v>

891
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.230
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything that he's doing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not happy with?</v>

892
00:39:44.231 --> 00:39:45.310
<v Speaker 4>So I'll give you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you this.</v>

893
00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:47.500
<v Speaker 4>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you something that just in the</v>

894
00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:48.334
<v Speaker 4>last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think you know what you're gonna </v>

895
00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.350
<v Speaker 4>say and I'll probably agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

896
00:39:50.351 --> 00:39:53.260
<v Speaker 4>So in the last 10 days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he basically instructed Jeff sessions</v>

897
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.190
<v Speaker 4>we're going to agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

898
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 4>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>states' rights,</v>

899
00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:58.144
<v Speaker 4>if you care about that constitution that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said he loves so much and all of </v>

900
00:40:00.371 --> 00:40:01.204
<v Speaker 4>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the states should be able to make laws </v>

901
00:40:02.831 --> 00:40:03.664
<v Speaker 4>that they want and the federal </v>
<v Speaker 4>government should not impede on that </v>

902
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.873
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have something called the 10th </v>

903
00:40:06.491 --> 00:40:07.181
<v Speaker 4>amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>

904
00:40:07.181 --> 00:40:09.220
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in a case like this,</v>

905
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.133
<v Speaker 4>what's happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is there such a disconnect between </v>

906
00:40:12.611 --> 00:40:13.444
<v Speaker 4>the ideas of freedom that you laid out </v>
<v Speaker 4>so eloquently and then what sessions is </v>

907
00:40:17.201 --> 00:40:18.190
<v Speaker 4>doing in practice?</v>

908
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:19.251
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

909
00:40:19.251 --> 00:40:21.590
<v Speaker 3>I can't explain it well and I won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend it because I don't agree with it.</v>

910
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big defender of individual freedom</v>

911
00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:26.960
<v Speaker 3>and liberty and I get a lot of hate from</v>
<v Speaker 3>my social skin are conservative friends.</v>

912
00:40:26.961 --> 00:40:28.820
<v Speaker 3>When I argued for decriminalization of </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>

913
00:40:28.821 --> 00:40:30.620
<v Speaker 3>I've never done drugs in my life and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't plan to,</v>

914
00:40:30.621 --> 00:40:32.600
<v Speaker 3>but someone wants to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool,</v>

915
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.453
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever,</v>

916
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.393
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put whatever you want to put in your </v>

917
00:40:34.851 --> 00:40:36.320
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as it doesn't harm someone else.</v>

918
00:40:36.321 --> 00:40:39.710
<v Speaker 3>So this is something that I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually not making the correct decision</v>

919
00:40:39.711 --> 00:40:40.760
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>

920
00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've said it publicly and you know,</v>

921
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.473
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I find someone like jeff sessions </v>

922
00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:48.200
<v Speaker 3>who's gets most of the stuff right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been great on guns.</v>

923
00:40:48.201 --> 00:40:49.430
<v Speaker 3>He's been great on some of the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

924
00:40:49.431 --> 00:40:51.980
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think he's correct on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this marijuana.</v>

925
00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.813
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think he's correct </v>

926
00:40:52.881 --> 00:40:53.714
<v Speaker 3>politically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the majority of Americans </v>

927
00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:55.874
<v Speaker 3>don't agree on this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to go after people that are </v>

928
00:40:58.191 --> 00:41:01.280
<v Speaker 3>peacefully doing business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really what they're going after.</v>

929
00:41:01.281 --> 00:41:03.910
<v Speaker 3>This is the financial transaction side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

930
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.753
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not on the correct side of </v>

931
00:41:06.141 --> 00:41:08.000
<v Speaker 3>economic freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>

932
00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Disagreement is a healthy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

933
00:41:10.311 --> 00:41:13.790
<v Speaker 3>And we need to challenge our cabinet </v>
<v Speaker 3>officials and challenge our leaders when</v>

934
00:41:13.791 --> 00:41:14.624
<v Speaker 3>we don't see eye to eye with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is something that I </v>

935
00:41:16.071 --> 00:41:20.450
<v Speaker 3>think runs in the face of some of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>core beliefs and tenants.</v>

936
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.363
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just seems like so ideologically </v>

937
00:41:22.721 --> 00:41:23.554
<v Speaker 4>inconsistent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fighting for states' </v>

938
00:41:25.361 --> 00:41:27.020
<v Speaker 4>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been fighting for states' rights in</v>

939
00:41:27.021 --> 00:41:27.854
<v Speaker 4>that look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even now you've got people on the left </v>

940
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.380
<v Speaker 4>fighting for states' rights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous.</v>

941
00:41:32.381 --> 00:41:33.800
<v Speaker 4>It makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they're,</v>

942
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to defend sanctuary </v>
<v Speaker 4>cities.</v>

943
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:37.180
<v Speaker 4>So now their phones work doesn't change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

944
00:41:37.181 --> 00:41:38.510
<v Speaker 4>It's going against the federal </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

945
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:39.344
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

946
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.280
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

947
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.860
<v Speaker 3>I will say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of it is stemmed from this</v>

948
00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:43.694
<v Speaker 3>kind of old holdover war on drugs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ronald Reagan declared in the 1980s </v>

949
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:49.340
<v Speaker 3>which was an abysmal and total failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

950
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:51.110
<v Speaker 3>The statistics speak for themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

951
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.113
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war on recreational marijuana has </v>

952
00:41:54.051 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 3>not been a net benefit for the taxpayer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for such society in general.</v>

953
00:41:57.471 --> 00:42:00.020
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come from the general worldview at the</v>

954
00:42:00.021 --> 00:42:00.854
<v Speaker 3>greatest change does not come through </v>
<v Speaker 3>government policy or through gum and </v>

955
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Speaker 3>bureaucrats and sort of be </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually consistent.</v>

956
00:42:05.721 --> 00:42:09.080
<v Speaker 3>I want the fend penalizing people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are peacefully selling,</v>

957
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:10.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabis to other people,</v>

958
00:42:10.881 --> 00:42:13.130
<v Speaker 3>whether it be for medically or </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreationally and,</v>

959
00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:13.964
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want it to high school in northwest </v>

960
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:17.000
<v Speaker 3>suburbs of Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the story I always tell people,</v>

961
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.020
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie,</v>

962
00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:18.854
<v Speaker 3>your concern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how can you possibly hold his </v>

963
00:42:19.461 --> 00:42:19.790
<v Speaker 3>position?</v>

964
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.230
<v Speaker 3>You know that it's always at these tea </v>
<v Speaker 3>party groups,</v>

965
00:42:21.231 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 3>which I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the tea party.</v>

966
00:42:22.341 --> 00:42:23.210
<v Speaker 3>I love these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

967
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.340
<v Speaker 3>But they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

968
00:42:24.341 --> 00:42:26.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called them like the hardcore group,</v>

969
00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:28.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're the Alex Jones,</v>

970
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:29.294
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flag carry and people that are really </v>

971
00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:32.870
<v Speaker 3>hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really big in the conspiracy and</v>

972
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:33.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

973
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:34.520
<v Speaker 3>they're always asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie,</v>

974
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.030
<v Speaker 3>how can you possibly be on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 3>decriminalization of marijuana?</v>

975
00:42:38.031 --> 00:42:38.864
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

976
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.700
<v Speaker 3>I went to high school in the northwest </v>
<v Speaker 3>suburbs of Chicago.</v>

977
00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember after football games,</v>

978
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 3>like kids had backpacks full of </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

979
00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Now marijuana is illegal in Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marijuana is illegal in Cook County.</v>

980
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:50.450
<v Speaker 3>And there were cops in our halls looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it all the time.</v>

981
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.300
<v Speaker 3>It was not working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

982
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.220
<v Speaker 3>let's just put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kids who wanted it found it.</v>

983
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:56.930
<v Speaker 3>The kids like me who didn't want you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with it,</v>

984
00:42:56.931 --> 00:42:58.270
<v Speaker 3>just walked away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

985
00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.530
<v Speaker 3>what other better illustration of </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom than that?</v>

986
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.780
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to engage with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just walk away,</v>

987
00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.540
<v Speaker 3>find somewhere else to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't need to pay,</v>

988
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.553
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dea or FBI units to go do locker </v>

989
00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:13.280
<v Speaker 3>room rates is something that kids were </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreationally and peacefully doing.</v>

990
00:43:13.281 --> 00:43:14.114
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a proponent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would support a charity to try to </v>

991
00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 3>educate students not to do it cause I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think at root,</v>

992
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.153
<v Speaker 3>you know had a net negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why is it government's role to </v>

993
00:43:20.781 --> 00:43:21.614
<v Speaker 3>social engineer us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's a nonlethal </v>

994
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.750
<v Speaker 3>substance.</v>

995
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:25.583
<v Speaker 4>I always think it's so interesting like </v>
<v Speaker 4>look I now I'm in California where it's </v>

996
00:43:28.381 --> 00:43:33.210
<v Speaker 4>now now recreationally legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have a medical marijuana card.</v>

997
00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:35.490
<v Speaker 4>Got To hurt my knee playing basketball a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of years ago.</v>

998
00:43:35.491 --> 00:43:36.324
<v Speaker 4>The places right over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to walk you in there just to </v>

999
00:43:38.071 --> 00:43:38.904
<v Speaker 4>see what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then before it like you're not going to </v>

1000
00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:42.930
<v Speaker 4>persuade me to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's fine.</v>

1001
00:43:42.931 --> 00:43:43.764
<v Speaker 4>Like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think it would be fun to go in </v>

1002
00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:45.624
<v Speaker 4>there with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1003
00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.493
<v Speaker 4>That would be what was going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>camp where my mango hat that would not </v>

1004
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 4>go well in La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1005
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:58.410
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's funny because anytime </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I ever bought weed illegally,</v>

1006
00:43:58.411 --> 00:43:59.244
<v Speaker 4>like when I lived in New York City and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just get it from whoever the weed guy </v>

1007
00:44:01.231 --> 00:44:02.064
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know who the weed guy when </v>

1008
00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.293
<v Speaker 4>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I never once in 15 years or </v>

1009
00:44:05.521 --> 00:44:07.290
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never had the guy selling.</v>

1010
00:44:07.291 --> 00:44:08.400
<v Speaker 4>We'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1011
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:10.520
<v Speaker 4>you want to buy crack?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to buy coke you.</v>

1012
00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.340
<v Speaker 4>And yet we can go to prescription play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can go to a psychiatrist,</v>

1013
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.370
<v Speaker 4>push every button rug and it's a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 4>times worse.</v>

1014
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:18.800
<v Speaker 3>And it's an and it's chemically </v>
<v Speaker 3>addictive.</v>

1015
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:19.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1016
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:20.503
<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know plenty of people that have had </v>

1017
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.030
<v Speaker 3>stories to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie,</v>

1018
00:44:23.031 --> 00:44:23.864
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't for medicinal marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have gone to narco substances </v>

1019
00:44:27.711 --> 00:44:29.690
<v Speaker 3>and I would have been a really a worse </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1020
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so fine.</v>

1021
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:32.123
<v Speaker 3>But that's the core tenant of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what you're seeing here is </v>

1022
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.530
<v Speaker 3>most of our turning point followers </v>
<v Speaker 3>would find sympathy with my argument.</v>

1023
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 3>And this is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a natural change and a political</v>

1024
00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:42.750
<v Speaker 3>movement as time goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1025
00:44:42.751 --> 00:44:43.260
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1026
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.180
<v Speaker 3>the fact that jeff sessions holds that </v>
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>

1027
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 3>maybe he has an experience that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't experienced,</v>

1028
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:50.100
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is really personal to him.</v>

1029
00:44:50.101 --> 00:44:51.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1030
00:44:51.571 --> 00:44:52.404
<v Speaker 3>marijuana do something horrible to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>family member or people in local </v>

1031
00:44:54.661 --> 00:44:55.560
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alabama.</v>

1032
00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I'll disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably not right.</v>

1033
00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.590
<v Speaker 3>But you just have like whatever.</v>

1034
00:44:58.590 --> 00:44:59.423
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to give the benefit of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>doubt because I think he's generally a </v>

1035
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:02.034
<v Speaker 3>good person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always tried to give the benefit of </v>

1036
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:04.500
<v Speaker 3>the doubt when people hold these </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions.</v>

1037
00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's not the right policy,</v>

1038
00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:07.464
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 20 years you're going to see the </v>

1039
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:13.020
<v Speaker 3>conservative libertarian majority </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to rand Paul advocate for this.</v>

1040
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:15.600
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll be able to point out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypocrisy of the left.</v>

1041
00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:16.051
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1042
00:45:16.051 --> 00:45:16.884
<v Speaker 3>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're cool with people being able </v>

1043
00:45:19.231 --> 00:45:20.390
<v Speaker 3>to sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to sell it long.</v>

1044
00:45:20.391 --> 00:45:21.224
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't harm someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you trying to tell me I can't </v>

1045
00:45:23.161 --> 00:45:25.170
<v Speaker 3>frack this oil field and the Permian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Basin?</v>

1046
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1047
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.753
<v Speaker 3>If you want to have like an intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be intellectually </v>

1048
00:45:28.471 --> 00:45:29.281
<v Speaker 3>consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1049
00:45:29.281 --> 00:45:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1050
00:45:30.241 --> 00:45:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I want to do one other thing on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>social stuff and then we'll move over to</v>

1051
00:45:32.551 --> 00:45:33.190
<v Speaker 3>some I'm cool with.</v>

1052
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:34.290
<v Speaker 3>So I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1053
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:35.280
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1054
00:45:35.281 --> 00:45:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I never had like I guess agreements that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you immediately sat down.</v>

1055
00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:39.180
<v Speaker 3>You're like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go.</v>

1056
00:45:39.181 --> 00:45:40.980
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously challenged me here we are.</v>

1057
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:41.993
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I don't think this one will be too </v>

1058
00:45:43.081 --> 00:45:44.900
<v Speaker 3>much of a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's an interesting shirt.</v>

1059
00:45:44.901 --> 00:45:47.210
<v Speaker 3>It just shows how things have shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1060
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.083
<v Speaker 3>so at the Republican convention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter Teal and openly gay man spoke </v>

1061
00:45:51.691 --> 00:45:53.700
<v Speaker 3>before trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1062
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:56.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm a proud gay man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a standing ovation.</v>

1063
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.890
<v Speaker 3>Then trump gets up there and talks about</v>
<v Speaker 3>points,</v>

1064
00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.990
<v Speaker 3>amount trow right points him and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1065
00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:01.824
<v Speaker 3>it makes me very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the exact quote he said because </v>

1066
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.600
<v Speaker 3>he makes me very happy that they with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hand,</v>

1067
00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:08.880
<v Speaker 3>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

1068
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.000
<v Speaker 3>that the fact that there's been such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wholesale shift in that,</v>

1069
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.073
<v Speaker 3>that even right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ted Cruz or the guys that you might </v>

1070
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:17.430
<v Speaker 3>consider a little more of the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives,</v>

1071
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:19.230
<v Speaker 3>which I'm one I could be.</v>

1072
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.651
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1073
00:46:19.651 --> 00:46:20.484
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so where you come from basically as far </v>

1074
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:24.114
<v Speaker 3>as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't really see this as an issue </v>

1075
00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:26.750
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a fair,</v>

1076
00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:27.723
<v Speaker 3>I think that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so let me dive deeper and also pose </v>

1077
00:46:30.451 --> 00:46:33.030
<v Speaker 3>a hypothetical to some of the leftest </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching this.</v>

1078
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:34.163
<v Speaker 3>Peter Teal openly gay man gets a </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing ovation at the Republican </v>

1079
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.340
<v Speaker 3>National Convention and then pointed as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1080
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:38.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1081
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:39.623
<v Speaker 3>pointed out by the candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that an evangelical pastor </v>

1082
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.590
<v Speaker 3>that was pro Israel that might be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrat would have even been allowed to</v>

1083
00:46:46.591 --> 00:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>speak at the Democratic national </v>
<v Speaker 3>convention or giving a standing ovation?</v>

1084
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.280
<v Speaker 3>They booed God when he was doing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was when it was mentioned.</v>

1085
00:46:53.281 --> 00:46:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They literally,</v>

1086
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:55.383
<v Speaker 3>what is the shift here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shift is the Republican Party is </v>

1087
00:46:58.291 --> 00:46:59.910
<v Speaker 3>beginning to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1088
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.070
<v Speaker 3>we're the party of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1089
00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:04.110
<v Speaker 3>it's cool if you want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's,</v>

1090
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:07.350
<v Speaker 3>it's a real sea change because even if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see ran Paul big,</v>

1091
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:08.340
<v Speaker 3>getting to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1092
00:47:08.341 --> 00:47:10.170
<v Speaker 3>endorse more of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1093
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:14.460
<v Speaker 3>favorable drug policy positions on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>side of freedom or gay marriage,</v>

1094
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:15.294
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're starting to see a sea change </v>

1095
00:47:16.711 --> 00:47:17.544
<v Speaker 3>where it's becoming the sole searching </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Republican Party as we don't under </v>

1096
00:47:20.641 --> 00:47:24.480
<v Speaker 3>the last 30 years is what's the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that ties our party together.</v>

1097
00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>

1098
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:26.873
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why you're starting </v>

1099
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:28.590
<v Speaker 3>to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the left,</v>

1100
00:47:28.591 --> 00:47:31.420
<v Speaker 3>they can't what ties them together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oppression.</v>

1101
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's the oppression Olympics.</v>

1102
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like who suffers more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1103
00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:39.690
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a really good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Segue to one final point is what I think</v>

1104
00:47:40.121 --> 00:47:40.954
<v Speaker 3>is the position that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulated better is I have no problem </v>

1105
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:44.530
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1106
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:45.430
<v Speaker 3>gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1107
00:47:45.431 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 3>like I believe marriage one man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one woman,</v>

1108
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:48.310
<v Speaker 3>that's my own personal position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1109
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 3>But I'm never going to tell government </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have someone live a life.</v>

1110
00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:52.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're married,</v>

1111
00:47:52.051 --> 00:47:52.884
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you should have all the same tax </v>

1112
00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 3>benefits adopt children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

1113
00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you feel the same way about you?</v>

1114
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:57.101
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

1115
00:47:57.101 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1116
00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:58.683
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's more of like a generational </v>

1117
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:00.334
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's where I think Republican </v>

1118
00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.610
<v Speaker 3>conservatives need to really fight hard.</v>

1119
00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:05.950
<v Speaker 3>And I think you agree as the religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberty stuff is,</v>

1120
00:48:05.951 --> 00:48:06.784
<v Speaker 3>are you going to force a Christian Baker</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a cake for a gay couple that is </v>

1121
00:48:11.621 --> 00:48:14.620
<v Speaker 3>not the same thing as being cool with </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay marriage.</v>

1122
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:18.040
<v Speaker 3>And the left is trying to make a moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>equivalency argument of the civil rights</v>

1123
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:18.874
<v Speaker 3>of the 1960s and someone would having to</v>
<v Speaker 3>violate their religious conscience to </v>

1124
00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:24.844
<v Speaker 3>make a cake for a gay couple because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to and they want to have </v>

1125
00:48:27.311 --> 00:48:28.144
<v Speaker 3>fascism where you can go into a private </v>
<v Speaker 3>company and so you have to produce it </v>

1126
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.660
<v Speaker 3>product or service because we have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain,</v>

1127
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle that's dangerous and wrong.</v>

1128
00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:38.283
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's where the fight needs</v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen and that's where I think we </v>

1129
00:48:40.901 --> 00:48:41.734
<v Speaker 3>can actually win conference over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think also the technology is the </v>

1130
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:46.870
<v Speaker 3>answer to some of those problems where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd kind of sucks that,</v>

1131
00:48:46.871 --> 00:48:47.704
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did in my prager u video from last </v>

1132
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.010
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was excellent.</v>

1133
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:50.843
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was the line that really </v>

1134
00:48:51.521 --> 00:48:52.354
<v Speaker 3>caught on because I don't want to force </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Baker to do something just as if </v>

1135
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:57.670
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1136
00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:58.563
<v Speaker 3>you could use any example here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if there was a Jewish artists who </v>

1137
00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:03.040
<v Speaker 3>had a website that they take commissions</v>
<v Speaker 3>for paintings,</v>

1138
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.160
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want the government forcing </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to paint neo Nazi paintings.</v>

1139
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the same thing.</v>

1140
00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And would you want to force,</v>

1141
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Muslim,</v>

1142
00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wedding hall to have to host,</v>

1143
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1144
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.430
<v Speaker 3>someone that is a great critic of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1145
00:49:18.431 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 3>That would violate one of the tenants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the pillars of Islam,</v>

1146
00:49:21.431 --> 00:49:22.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1147
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.863
<v Speaker 3>But for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left is way overstepping their </v>

1148
00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:26.314
<v Speaker 3>bounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the circuit court of California was </v>

1149
00:49:27.851 --> 00:49:28.684
<v Speaker 3>like lost their freaking mind seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where they don't realize the slippery </v>

1150
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:33.364
<v Speaker 3>slope that they're engaging in here </v>
<v Speaker 3>where if you have a private business </v>

1151
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.473
<v Speaker 3>with their own private conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should be allowed to accept and </v>

1152
00:49:40.571 --> 00:49:42.100
<v Speaker 3>denied business as they see fit.</v>

1153
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:42.933
<v Speaker 3>Especially if it's business that takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>preplanning like such as a wedding cake </v>

1154
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:48.303
<v Speaker 3>or photography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only argument they might make as if </v>

1155
00:49:50.951 --> 00:49:51.461
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1156
00:49:51.461 --> 00:49:53.440
<v Speaker 3>running a fast food restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what,</v>

1157
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.390
<v Speaker 3>if someone wants to be a racist or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigot,</v>

1158
00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:56.493
<v Speaker 3>they have that right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to go buy products from </v>

1159
00:49:58.661 --> 00:49:59.830
<v Speaker 3>them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1160
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:00.693
<v Speaker 3>That's how you win arguments without </v>
<v Speaker 3>having to use the government gun on </v>

1161
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:05.740
<v Speaker 3>people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which again,</v>

1162
00:50:05.741 --> 00:50:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the argument that we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make.</v>

1163
00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:10.000
<v Speaker 3>But if look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a gay couple wants to get married,</v>

1164
00:50:10.001 --> 00:50:11.080
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whatever.</v>

1165
00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:13.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the law of the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Move on to bigger battles like religious</v>

1166
00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:15.010
<v Speaker 3>liberty and freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1167
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:17.230
<v Speaker 3>let's shift a little bit to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>

1168
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.810
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are a Christian conservative.</v>

1169
00:50:19.811 --> 00:50:20.644
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just that phrase triggers a certain </v>

1170
00:50:23.411 --> 00:50:24.610
<v Speaker 3>amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first off,</v>

1171
00:50:24.611 --> 00:50:26.260
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is a Christian conservative?</v>

1172
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 3>Which always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which always stuns me.</v>

1173
00:50:28.131 --> 00:50:30.080
<v Speaker 3>So I do a lot of campus too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I'll tell you a quick story.</v>

1174
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:30.914
<v Speaker 3>A lot of campus tours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go through my litany of what I </v>

1175
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:35.360
<v Speaker 3>call hard truths told by Charlie Kirk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll say,</v>

1176
00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:36.423
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>socialism is the greatest killer of </v>

1177
00:50:37.281 --> 00:50:38.114
<v Speaker 3>humanity in the last 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll say free enterprise is the </v>

1178
00:50:40.281 --> 00:50:41.114
<v Speaker 3>greatest economic system ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'll say three words and it </v>

1179
00:50:43.071 --> 00:50:46.610
<v Speaker 3>drives them so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say God is real.</v>

1180
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 3>And it's like they just start shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the left,</v>

1181
00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:51.014
<v Speaker 3>they think they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know how to handle it and </v>

1182
00:50:52.131 --> 00:50:54.050
<v Speaker 3>half the place loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half the place hates it.</v>

1183
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why that's so triggering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm a Christian first and foremost.</v>

1184
00:50:58.071 --> 00:50:59.960
<v Speaker 3>I believe Jesus Christ is the son of </v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

1185
00:50:59.961 --> 00:51:01.610
<v Speaker 3>And he came down and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1186
00:51:01.611 --> 00:51:02.444
<v Speaker 3>he died for all our sins and we have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good documentation of that and we could </v>

1187
00:51:05.211 --> 00:51:06.290
<v Speaker 3>debate and discuss that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1188
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:07.670
<v Speaker 3>But as a Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1189
00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:08.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that,</v>

1190
00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:09.753
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are called to try to advance the </v>

1191
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:14.990
<v Speaker 3>Kingdom of God and the Ministry of Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ as many people as possible and as</v>

1192
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:16.460
<v Speaker 3>peacefully as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

1193
00:51:16.461 --> 00:51:17.294
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how I try to live my own </v>

1194
00:51:18.111 --> 00:51:21.470
<v Speaker 3>personal life and make my own personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions as a conservative,</v>

1195
00:51:21.471 --> 00:51:22.304
<v Speaker 3>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me go ahead.</v>

1196
00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't see you proselytizing religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>though in the public way.</v>

1197
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard you speak before.</v>

1198
00:51:28.431 --> 00:51:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've never heard you pushed that.</v>

1199
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 3>So I say it every so often when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when asked,</v>

1200
00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:35.900
<v Speaker 3>but I look at my speaking no different </v>
<v Speaker 3>than sometimes doing a job,</v>

1201
00:51:35.901 --> 00:51:37.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a plumber,</v>

1202
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:37.934
<v Speaker 3>electrician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not going to tell every person </v>

1203
00:51:39.051 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 3>he turns around the corner like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1204
00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:43.250
<v Speaker 3>have you heard the name of Jesus Christ?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1205
00:51:43.251 --> 00:51:44.084
<v Speaker 3>So you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be two offsetting and </v>

1206
00:51:45.501 --> 00:51:46.010
<v Speaker 3>off putting.</v>

1207
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:47.840
<v Speaker 3>But I also try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1208
00:51:47.841 --> 00:51:49.340
<v Speaker 3>through my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of my platforms,</v>

1209
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about my personal beliefs,</v>

1210
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:53.180
<v Speaker 3>no matter how triggering it might be to </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

1211
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.950
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like campus tours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to,</v>

1212
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>advance,</v>

1213
00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.650
<v Speaker 3>but of course I could probably do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better job of it.</v>

1214
00:51:57.651 --> 00:51:59.290
<v Speaker 3>But with that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1215
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:01.550
<v Speaker 3>I would consider myself more as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatorium,</v>

1216
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:05.120
<v Speaker 3>which I find to be a new breed of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1217
00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.740
<v Speaker 3>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you and I talked about.</v>

1218
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:09.620
<v Speaker 3>And some people have already been </v>
<v Speaker 3>labeling themselves as such.</v>

1219
00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:10.454
<v Speaker 3>And I find no contradiction between my </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian worldview and my political </v>

1220
00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:15.530
<v Speaker 3>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1221
00:52:15.531 --> 00:52:16.940
<v Speaker 3>I find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1222
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:18.040
<v Speaker 3>great amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1223
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:18.883
<v Speaker 3>synchrony actually between what I find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I believe theologically and what I </v>

1224
00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:24.350
<v Speaker 3>believe spiritually and religiously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1225
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:25.213
<v Speaker 3>to also what I advocate for politically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is essentially the nonaggression </v>

1226
00:52:28.611 --> 00:52:29.444
<v Speaker 3>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1227
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.373
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believing in productive people in free </v>

1228
00:52:32.181 --> 00:52:35.540
<v Speaker 3>societies should be able to make your </v>
<v Speaker 3>choices as you see fit as long as you're</v>

1229
00:52:35.541 --> 00:52:36.530
<v Speaker 3>not harming someone else.</v>

1230
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:42.010
<v Speaker 3>How did Christians and up as so much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the butt of what the left hates?</v>

1231
00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Because you can open up every day </v>
<v Speaker 3>another buzzfeed article mocking,</v>

1232
00:52:47.121 --> 00:52:47.890
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1233
00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:51.290
<v Speaker 3>Chris genomes and Mike and huff po and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1234
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.790
<v Speaker 3>they all love me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but boy,</v>

1235
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:53.803
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they must,</v>

1236
00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:54.890
<v Speaker 3>they must.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that I'm a,</v>

1237
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:56.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's nuts.</v>

1238
00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how did that happen?</v>

1239
00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.353
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think what happened is that </v>

1240
00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Christian conservatives fell for a trap </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they really should have rejected,</v>

1241
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:09.800
<v Speaker 3>which is we might hold these truths very</v>
<v Speaker 3>near and dear to our heart,</v>

1242
00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.220
<v Speaker 3>theologically and biblically and </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritually,</v>

1243
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.073
<v Speaker 3>religiously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think where the line was crossed </v>

1244
00:53:15.261 --> 00:53:16.094
<v Speaker 3>is in the sixties and seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties where we tried to impose those </v>

1245
00:53:19.401 --> 00:53:20.234
<v Speaker 3>beliefs through government policy where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people then inherently have a rejection </v>

1246
00:53:23.811 --> 00:53:24.441
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Similarly,</v>

1247
00:53:24.441 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 3>how people are the left and posing their</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy worldview upon us.</v>

1248
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.273
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was a big mistake because </v>

1249
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:32.700
<v Speaker 3>it created this kind of counter </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution,</v>

1250
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:33.534
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have to live the way </v>

1251
00:53:34.831 --> 00:53:36.870
<v Speaker 3>some Christian and Alabama wants me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

1252
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like it's,</v>

1253
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 3>it's the imposition of those values </v>
<v Speaker 3>through legislation and government,</v>

1254
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.920
<v Speaker 3>which is something I don't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>support,</v>

1255
00:53:43.921 --> 00:53:46.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I try to always advocate for everyone</v>

1256
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:47.214
<v Speaker 3>in my political positions through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>secular worldview because that is the </v>

1257
00:53:50.431 --> 00:53:52.500
<v Speaker 3>vast majority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the actual,</v>

1258
00:53:52.501 --> 00:53:54.490
<v Speaker 3>the government system that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you know,</v>

1259
00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.393
<v Speaker 3>decided to create,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do have a separation of church and </v>

1260
00:53:56.791 --> 00:53:59.640
<v Speaker 3>state and we should support that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With that being said,</v>

1261
00:53:59.641 --> 00:54:02.400
<v Speaker 3>I can still have my own personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions and my own personal,</v>

1262
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1263
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.553
<v Speaker 3>ways to go about changing public policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when we start to say we should </v>

1264
00:54:08.251 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 3>support this law because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian thing to do,</v>

1265
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.650
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think beginning that has turned people</v>

1266
00:54:13.651 --> 00:54:14.484
<v Speaker 3>off for the last 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it say also about Christians </v>

1267
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:17.671
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1268
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:21.240
<v Speaker 3>we talked about gay marriage before that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a shift.</v>

1269
00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There actually has been a shift.</v>

1270
00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Now you're basically arguing it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political shift or utilitarian.</v>

1271
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just,</v>

1272
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of giving me just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>realist argument.</v>

1273
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:30.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is there something else going on </v>

1274
00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:33.100
<v Speaker 3>there too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there is some,</v>

1275
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:33.961
<v Speaker 3>could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1276
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:36.000
<v Speaker 3>the tolerance to tolerance in the truest</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

1277
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:37.083
<v Speaker 3>And here this is the other problem with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians and me being a card carrying </v>

1278
00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:44.460
<v Speaker 3>member of this community and I try my </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardest and I fail is,</v>

1279
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:47.910
<v Speaker 3>and I'm around a lot of these Christians</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I sometimes fall into it.</v>

1280
00:54:47.911 --> 00:54:49.260
<v Speaker 3>It's this legalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1281
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.040
<v Speaker 3>is that I'm somehow better than you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a Christian.</v>

1282
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 3>And I really think that's done such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>disservice to the Christian community,</v>

1283
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:57.660
<v Speaker 3>especially the Christian conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

1284
00:54:57.930 --> 00:54:58.763
<v Speaker 3>It's the sanctimonious approach to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle that I find to be really off </v>

1285
00:55:02.401 --> 00:55:04.500
<v Speaker 3>putting to a lot of non believers.</v>

1286
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:05.790
<v Speaker 3>And people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1287
00:55:05.791 --> 00:55:07.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be a Christian because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're always going to talk down to me,</v>

1288
00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.330
<v Speaker 3>or they're gonna make me live by this </v>
<v Speaker 3>set of beliefs.</v>

1289
00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:12.420
<v Speaker 3>So they think they're better than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a number one critique I get.</v>

1290
00:55:12.421 --> 00:55:13.320
<v Speaker 3>It's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1291
00:55:13.321 --> 00:55:15.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe Jesus Christ is actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>the son of God,</v>

1292
00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:16.650
<v Speaker 3>or I don't believe the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1293
00:55:16.651 --> 00:55:18.870
<v Speaker 3>those are actually things I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be ironed out.</v>

1294
00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 3>It's more so like I've always been </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked down to or why when I was a young</v>

1295
00:55:22.411 --> 00:55:23.244
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Catholic school and they gave </v>

1296
00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:24.654
<v Speaker 3>me these 15 things I couldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of that I rebelled and </v>

1297
00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:29.430
<v Speaker 3>rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think this idea that actually Jesus</v>

1298
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Christ advocated for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1299
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.120
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dined with the tax collectors.</v>

1300
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:35.220
<v Speaker 3>I was best friends with the prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1301
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I never thought that they were any </v>
<v Speaker 3>better than the my disciples.</v>

1302
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:40.531
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1303
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:42.810
<v Speaker 3>and of course I don't live this out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best I should,</v>

1304
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:44.820
<v Speaker 3>but we're Christians have gotten it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1305
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Is this fierce fire and Brimstone </v>
<v Speaker 3>legalist,</v>

1306
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.130
<v Speaker 3>thou shall all homosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1307
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:51.480
<v Speaker 3>like that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1308
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:54.480
<v Speaker 3>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not what the,</v>

1309
00:55:54.481 --> 00:55:55.314
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the teachings and the evidence we have </v>

1310
00:55:56.581 --> 00:55:59.610
<v Speaker 3>of Jesus Christ's life ever taught us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was welcoming,</v>

1311
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:01.200
<v Speaker 3>he was tolerant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was accepting,</v>

1312
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.153
<v Speaker 3>he had standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was fierce when it came to eternity </v>

1313
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:05.214
<v Speaker 3>in the standards of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he wasn't afraid to go chill with </v>

1314
00:56:07.351 --> 00:56:08.184
<v Speaker 3>tax collectors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which were considered like the lowest </v>

1315
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:14.010
<v Speaker 3>form of individual possible in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Middle East during that time.</v>

1316
00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:17.130
<v Speaker 3>And so I think we as Christians can </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn a lot of that in modern society.</v>

1317
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.053
<v Speaker 3>And when we wrap this thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to go have lunch with some </v>

1318
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.880
<v Speaker 3>prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1319
00:56:20.881 --> 00:56:23.380
<v Speaker 3>if they want to hear about the good news</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Jesus Christ,</v>

1320
00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:25.590
<v Speaker 3>even so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1321
00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:27.250
<v Speaker 3>He's sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are like,</v>

1322
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.060
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1323
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:32.080
<v Speaker 3>but the point being is we should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we as Christians have to do a better job</v>

1324
00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:36.910
<v Speaker 3>of not being the sanctimonious moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>conjectures,</v>

1325
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.890
<v Speaker 3>which we get labeled at summit and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much</v>

1326
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:39.983
<v Speaker 4>so when you see a guy like Shapiro or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy like prager prager's more than my </v>

1327
00:56:43.681 --> 00:56:44.514
<v Speaker 4>heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prager basically a secular Jew at this </v>

1328
00:56:46.141 --> 00:56:47.910
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but grew up Orthodox Shapiro,</v>

1329
00:56:47.911 --> 00:56:49.770
<v Speaker 4>obviously observant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religious,</v>

1330
00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.560
<v Speaker 4>there've been orthodox Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys basically,</v>

1331
00:56:52.561 --> 00:56:53.394
<v Speaker 4>from what I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agree on pretty much everything </v>

1332
00:56:55.231 --> 00:56:57.540
<v Speaker 4>politically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're obviously more trump than then.</v>

1333
00:56:57.541 --> 00:56:59.910
<v Speaker 4>Shapiro isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's pretty on any given day,</v>

1334
00:56:59.911 --> 00:57:02.220
<v Speaker 4>prager definitely is more pro trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but does,</v>

1335
00:57:02.221 --> 00:57:04.590
<v Speaker 4>does any of your religious differences </v>
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>

1336
00:57:04.591 --> 00:57:06.720
<v Speaker 4>I know that doesn't matter to you in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of policy,</v>

1337
00:57:06.721 --> 00:57:07.554
<v Speaker 4>that's very obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just in terms of like your humanity </v>

1338
00:57:10.381 --> 00:57:13.200
<v Speaker 4>or the way your worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does any of that matter to you?</v>

1339
00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.473
<v Speaker 3>I've had wonderful discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Dennis prager about what he </v>

1340
00:57:17.781 --> 00:57:19.760
<v Speaker 3>believes theologically and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1341
00:57:19.761 --> 00:57:20.594
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Dennis prager is like the Yoda </v>

1342
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:24.860
<v Speaker 3>of the conservative movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like unbelievably brilliant.</v>

1343
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly.</v>

1344
00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:27.590
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1345
00:57:27.591 --> 00:57:29.300
<v Speaker 3>he's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And same with Ben.</v>

1346
00:57:29.301 --> 00:57:31.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listen to their stuff every single day</v>

1347
00:57:31.011 --> 00:57:34.790
<v Speaker 3>and prager university does a heroic job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't bother me at all.</v>

1348
00:57:34.791 --> 00:57:36.100
<v Speaker 3>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always challenged.</v>

1349
00:57:36.101 --> 00:57:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I challenge,</v>

1350
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:38.751
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1351
00:57:38.751 --> 00:57:42.350
<v Speaker 3>religious and observant Jews with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty good questions.</v>

1352
00:57:42.351 --> 00:57:43.184
<v Speaker 3>I think because I'm very big into </v>
<v Speaker 3>apologetics of the New Testament in the </v>

1353
00:57:45.861 --> 00:57:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1354
00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:49.280
<v Speaker 3>the evidence for Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ask questions,</v>

1355
00:57:49.281 --> 00:57:52.130
<v Speaker 3>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then do you believe Paul existed in,</v>

1356
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:54.800
<v Speaker 3>do you think Paula Saaris existed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll say,</v>

1357
00:57:54.801 --> 00:57:56.300
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it doesn't do anything.</v>

1358
00:57:56.301 --> 00:57:57.134
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like weird that a Roman Jew</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped his whole amazing lifestyle and </v>

1359
00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:04.910
<v Speaker 3>like went all in for this Jesus Christ </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and then got persecuted,</v>

1360
00:58:04.911 --> 00:58:05.744
<v Speaker 3>put in jail six times and then reverse </v>
<v Speaker 3>crucified like with someone do that if </v>

1361
00:58:08.541 --> 00:58:10.160
<v Speaker 3>they actually didn't believe this.</v>

1362
00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:12.020
<v Speaker 3>That's a provocative question obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1363
00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:14.540
<v Speaker 3>But I love that and I love that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1364
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion and look,</v>

1365
00:58:16.461 --> 00:58:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Paul said very clearly in the New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Testament,</v>

1366
00:58:18.231 --> 00:58:19.160
<v Speaker 3>blessed the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1367
00:58:19.161 --> 00:58:21.430
<v Speaker 3>these are your brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no new testament,</v>

1368
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:22.970
<v Speaker 3>the old testament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we agree,</v>

1369
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the Jewish people and all that.</v>

1370
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:25.543
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we need more Jews to actually </v>

1371
00:58:27.711 --> 00:58:28.544
<v Speaker 3>become more observant and to understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>the roots of the Torah and the roots of </v>

1372
00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:35.720
<v Speaker 3>what God commanded through Moses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>through David and the,</v>

1373
00:58:35.721 --> 00:58:36.554
<v Speaker 3>the major and minor prophets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have such great respect for them </v>

1374
00:58:39.051 --> 00:58:41.510
<v Speaker 3>because they've done a great job of I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think awakening,</v>

1375
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:43.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that there are,</v>

1376
00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.653
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish conservatives out there and it's </v>

1377
00:58:45.921 --> 00:58:47.090
<v Speaker 3>okay to believe these things.</v>

1378
00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:48.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting because there's someone</v>

1379
00:58:48.441 --> 00:58:50.960
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't come from this from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious perspective.</v>

1380
00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:54.200
<v Speaker 4>I agree with the wider principle that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're pushing here,</v>

1381
00:58:54.201 --> 00:58:56.330
<v Speaker 4>which is that some of these minority </v>
<v Speaker 4>communities.</v>

1382
00:58:56.331 --> 00:58:57.650
<v Speaker 4>So in this case you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jews,</v>

1383
00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:58.693
<v Speaker 4>but you referenced black people earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I want to talk a little bit about </v>

1384
00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:02.410
<v Speaker 4>capital working with candice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1385
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.490
<v Speaker 4>but now I see it with the Asian </v>
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

1386
00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:06.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you just saw it in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>last couple of days.</v>

1387
00:59:06.561 --> 00:59:11.420
<v Speaker 4>There's this email that got leaked from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Google where they basically were saying,</v>

1388
00:59:11.421 --> 00:59:12.254
<v Speaker 4>we're going to hire people but not white</v>
<v Speaker 4>men or Asian women will be treated like </v>

1389
00:59:15.921 --> 00:59:17.600
<v Speaker 4>white women or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something to that effect.</v>

1390
00:59:17.601 --> 00:59:22.060
<v Speaker 4>Like this lunacy horribly racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the real race</v>

1391
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 3>and racism though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this kind of like,</v>

1392
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.590
<v Speaker 3>it's just there's this ranking of </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppression.</v>

1393
00:59:27.591 --> 00:59:28.424
<v Speaker 3>Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some of your skin color makes you </v>

1394
00:59:29.571 --> 00:59:31.010
<v Speaker 3>somewhat more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1395
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.353
<v Speaker 3>worthy of a position in the company or </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a university because you've been </v>

1396
00:59:35.871 --> 00:59:36.704
<v Speaker 3>through more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because you look different or the </v>

1397
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:38.624
<v Speaker 3>scary part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for the Asian community is </v>

1398
00:59:39.951 --> 00:59:43.610
<v Speaker 3>that your skin color and the way you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look is it makes you less worthy because</v>

1399
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:44.444
<v Speaker 3>you're going to work real hard and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hack the right </v>

1400
00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:48.170
<v Speaker 3>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1401
00:59:48.171 --> 00:59:49.004
<v Speaker 3>make no mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like an anti Asian American </v>

1402
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:54.010
<v Speaker 3>worldview that the left has now </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially embraced.</v>

1403
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:54.321
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1404
00:59:54.321 --> 00:59:57.100
<v Speaker 3>they've been successful enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we must discriminate against them so</v>

1405
00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:58.530
<v Speaker 3>we can help the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's,</v>

1406
00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's lunacy.</v>

1407
01:00:00.021 --> 01:00:00.854
<v Speaker 3>But going back to your point of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian conservative kind of </v>

1408
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's a lot,</v>

1409
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of us that hold these </v>
<v Speaker 3>beliefs very personal.</v>

1410
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.823
<v Speaker 3>But also that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of where we draw the line </v>

1411
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:11.451
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1412
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:12.284
<v Speaker 3>we have these personal beliefs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna dictate how we want to </v>

1413
01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:14.864
<v Speaker 3>live individually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how do we advocate for a society </v>

1414
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:21.340
<v Speaker 3>that allows the most amount of people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>advocate for their own personal beliefs,</v>

1415
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:23.450
<v Speaker 3>whatever they might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as it doesn't harm someone else.</v>

1416
01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.850
<v Speaker 3>So your basic argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think you hit on this a little bit</v>

1417
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:26.684
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be that the part of the reason </v>

1418
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:31.750
<v Speaker 3>that Europe is crumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crumbling,</v>

1419
01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:33.890
<v Speaker 3>the West is crumbling except for </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

1420
01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.581
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1421
01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:35.750
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're taping this,</v>

1422
01:00:35.751 --> 01:00:38.570
<v Speaker 3>it's going to go up next week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're taping this today is the three</v>

1423
01:00:38.571 --> 01:00:42.040
<v Speaker 3>year anniversary of Charlie Hebdo was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of years ago,</v>

1424
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:42.883
<v Speaker 3>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But today was the day that they finally </v>

1425
01:00:43.911 --> 01:00:44.744
<v Speaker 3>caught the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there was the shooting at the </v>

1426
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Kosher supermarket entire summers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

1427
01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Today a different supermarket was burned</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1428
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.823
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1429
01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:54.350
<v Speaker 3>this is still happening in Paris right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1430
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is happening all across Europe.</v>

1431
01:00:56.211 --> 01:00:57.470
<v Speaker 3>We know what's going on in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this,</v>

1432
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:58.543
<v Speaker 3>your basic premise would be that if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had held on to some of their </v>

1433
01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:04.220
<v Speaker 3>judeochristian values instead of trading</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in,</v>

1434
01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:08.070
<v Speaker 3>or what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think is essentially statism</v>

1435
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:10.340
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yet you're also a secularist,</v>

1436
01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:12.020
<v Speaker 3>which is an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's not,</v>

1437
01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:12.913
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's contradictory because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would make an argument that actually </v>

1438
01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:18.050
<v Speaker 3>the separation of church and State found</v>
<v Speaker 3>in America has helped the church.</v>

1439
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.170
<v Speaker 3>We still have the highest churchgoing </v>
<v Speaker 3>greats rates in the west.</v>

1440
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.093
<v Speaker 3>We still have the highest levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>private philanthropy have more churches </v>

1441
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:24.734
<v Speaker 3>opening than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The evangelical community is growing in </v>

1442
01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:28.820
<v Speaker 3>most states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Alan Dershowitz would say,</v>

1443
01:01:28.821 --> 01:01:31.340
<v Speaker 3>the separation church and state has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best thing for the church.</v>

1444
01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.800
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not imposed upon people.</v>

1445
01:01:33.801 --> 01:01:36.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you and I both agree,</v>

1446
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:38.930
<v Speaker 3>when as soon as you start to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone to do something,</v>

1447
01:01:38.931 --> 01:01:40.550
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a lot less sexy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>appealing.</v>

1448
01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.160
<v Speaker 3>It actually want to rebel against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to reject it.</v>

1449
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.233
<v Speaker 3>I would argue Europe through their </v>
<v Speaker 3>social welfare programs have </v>

1450
01:01:47.391 --> 01:01:50.330
<v Speaker 3>deteriorated the church be as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they start to say,</v>

1451
01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:51.950
<v Speaker 3>government is going to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1452
01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.680
<v Speaker 3>government is going to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>important thing in your life.</v>

1453
01:01:54.681 --> 01:01:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Government's gonna fix these vastly </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex social problems.</v>

1454
01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Then all of a sudden the church and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual becomes far less significant.</v>

1455
01:02:02.481 --> 01:02:04.730
<v Speaker 3>As Dennis prager says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the larger the government,</v>

1456
01:02:04.731 --> 01:02:05.564
<v Speaker 3>the smaller the citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're seeing that play out in </v>

1457
01:02:06.951 --> 01:02:07.784
<v Speaker 3>France and Spain and Portugal and Italy </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have individual philanthropy </v>

1458
01:02:11.091 --> 01:02:13.010
<v Speaker 3>disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have business startups,</v>

1459
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 3>ness totally evaporate.</v>

1460
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.273
<v Speaker 3>And the final point is what it really </v>
<v Speaker 3>lends itself to is more dangerous </v>

1461
01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 3>ideologies to take forms such as radical</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>

1462
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:23.483
<v Speaker 3>which is I think one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous widespread ideological </v>

1463
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:29.490
<v Speaker 3>movements happening in the West that no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one is talking about.</v>

1464
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:31.040
<v Speaker 3>And here's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>

1465
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:32.070
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a gay guy.</v>

1466
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:32.963
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would probably be worried if I start </v>

1467
01:02:34.531 --> 01:02:35.340
<v Speaker 3>to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1468
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.680
<v Speaker 3>radical Islam start to take root in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe.</v>

1469
01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a Christian.</v>

1470
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:40.110
<v Speaker 3>I'd be worried too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1471
01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on that program.</v>

1472
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want us both that and my friend.</v>

1473
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1474
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:45.803
<v Speaker 3>and that's something I find to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>horribly inconsistent with the left as </v>

1475
01:02:49.021 --> 01:02:49.854
<v Speaker 3>they try to be the champions of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these minority groups and all these </v>

1476
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:53.123
<v Speaker 3>supposed to depress groups yet here they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are kind of joining forces with </v>

1477
01:02:55.921 --> 01:02:56.754
<v Speaker 3>countries and movements and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>theocratic fascists in the Middle East </v>

1478
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:04.230
<v Speaker 3>that give homosexuals flying lessons on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the top of buildings.</v>

1479
01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.930
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then how do we,</v>

1480
01:03:06.931 --> 01:03:07.764
<v Speaker 3>I spent I think a good chunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the first year of this show </v>

1481
01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:11.243
<v Speaker 3>trying to talk about radical Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making a distinction between radical </v>

1482
01:03:14.671 --> 01:03:18.930
<v Speaker 3>Islam and the nominal Muslim person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>practices in faith privately.</v>

1483
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:21.420
<v Speaker 3>However they do just like most sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1484
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:22.343
<v Speaker 3>I try to separate Islam as a set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas worthy of criticism as </v>

1485
01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Christianity is and you is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>republicanism and all of that.</v>

1486
01:03:29.971 --> 01:03:30.804
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Versus people versus criticizing people </v>

1487
01:03:32.761 --> 01:03:33.594
<v Speaker 3>and treating people differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people in our space </v>

1488
01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:37.044
<v Speaker 3>have tried to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you don't get a lot of credit for </v>

1489
01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but okay,</v>

1490
01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:41.070
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need bonus credit.</v>

1491
01:03:41.071 --> 01:03:45.840
<v Speaker 3>But how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we talk about radical Islam in an</v>

1492
01:03:45.841 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 3>honest way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do.</v>

1493
01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 3>There is a differentiation that needs to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be drawn,</v>

1494
01:03:49.081 --> 01:03:49.914
<v Speaker 3>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we also do need to talk about the </v>

1495
01:03:51.121 --> 01:03:54.420
<v Speaker 3>broader implementation of an oven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic government and world view,</v>

1496
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1497
01:03:55.050 --> 01:04:00.050
<v Speaker 3>So Islam as its core at its core has </v>
<v Speaker 3>always been and will always be tied into</v>

1498
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:02.190
<v Speaker 3>the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as they can demonstrate that</v>

1499
01:04:02.191 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 3>they can be a majority in a country and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not be a theocratic government,</v>

1500
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.220
<v Speaker 3>then I'll start to seed some territory </v>
<v Speaker 3>against that.</v>

1501
01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.750
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>

1502
01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:10.853
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you are a Christian in Saudi </v>

1503
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.773
<v Speaker 3>Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose your head.</v>

1504
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:14.910
<v Speaker 3>If you're a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll find your family and kill all of</v>

1505
01:04:14.911 --> 01:04:15.540
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1506
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1507
01:04:17.671 --> 01:04:20.580
<v Speaker 3>So I think we need to draw a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>critique of that same in Iran,</v>

1508
01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:22.990
<v Speaker 3>which is Shia and Saudi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1509
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.800
<v Speaker 3>which was Sunni.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's something really I think,</v>

1510
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:27.023
<v Speaker 3>not correct about in modern society that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have obviously a Muslim majority </v>

1511
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:31.734
<v Speaker 3>country and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no Christians and no Jews and </v>

1512
01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:34.824
<v Speaker 3>no churches and no synagogues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something very intolerant about </v>

1513
01:04:36.781 --> 01:04:37.230
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1514
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:39.900
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that want to reform Islam,</v>

1515
01:04:39.901 --> 01:04:41.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm your biggest advocates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1516
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:42.623
<v Speaker 3>People that want to go through </v>
<v Speaker 3>reformation of Islam and try to </v>

1517
01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:46.644
<v Speaker 3>differentiate that no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam does not have to be tied to the </v>

1518
01:04:49.141 --> 01:04:49.891
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yes,</v>

1519
01:04:49.891 --> 01:04:50.724
<v Speaker 3>Islam can be tolerant of Christians and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews and gays and the modern feminist </v>

1520
01:04:53.881 --> 01:04:56.420
<v Speaker 3>movement and they should be allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>vote and drive and you know,</v>

1521
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:59.550
<v Speaker 3>be able to make decisions that they see </v>
<v Speaker 3>fit and not have to wear a full his job.</v>

1522
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.880
<v Speaker 3>I want those Muslims at succeed </v>
<v Speaker 3>frightened that the more radical voices,</v>

1523
01:05:05.311 --> 01:05:08.070
<v Speaker 3>which are in the tens of millions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not hundreds of millions,</v>

1524
01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.520
<v Speaker 3>are actually getting more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of an audience.</v>

1525
01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.200
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're creating,</v>

1526
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:14.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sectors of Europe that are quite </v>

1527
01:05:16.051 --> 01:05:16.884
<v Speaker 3>troubling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are advocating for the advancement </v>

1528
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:20.254
<v Speaker 3>of these more dangerous ideologies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>support honor killings and don't think </v>

1529
01:05:22.811 --> 01:05:23.644
<v Speaker 3>women should have the right to drive or </v>
<v Speaker 3>to vote or to be able to have </v>

1530
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:28.720
<v Speaker 3>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sort of form of government.</v>

1531
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.823
<v Speaker 3>And so I think a broader critique of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam needs to be put forth because </v>

1532
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:36.040
<v Speaker 3>they've been doing it against </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity for the last 100 years.</v>

1533
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:37.173
<v Speaker 3>I walk into a lecture hall and I hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how incredibly intolerant </v>

1534
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Christians are and how they're terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>people find hard stop.</v>

1535
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:43.953
<v Speaker 3>You go to the Vatican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman is allowed to wear shorts and </v>

1536
01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cutoff tee shirt.</v>

1537
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:50.950
<v Speaker 3>You go to Mecca and you're a Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get your head cut off.</v>

1538
01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you literally can't go.</v>

1539
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you literally not allowed there.</v>

1540
01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.600
<v Speaker 3>They're literally not allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>

1541
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:56.523
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a discussion that needs to </v>

1542
01:05:57.191 --> 01:05:59.680
<v Speaker 3>happen where a broader reformation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary,</v>

1543
01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.980
<v Speaker 3>but the more radical voices of Islam are</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually succeeding.</v>

1544
01:06:02.981 --> 01:06:05.290
<v Speaker 3>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at the most viral,</v>

1545
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>members of the youtube community and the</v>

1546
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Sunni Saudi region,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're the ones that are advocating</v>

1547
01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:12.940
<v Speaker 3>for a holy war and the extermination of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians.</v>

1548
01:06:12.941 --> 01:06:14.440
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones that are really taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>root.</v>

1549
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.633
<v Speaker 3>We have to support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to reinforce and we have to </v>

1550
01:06:18.281 --> 01:06:22.630
<v Speaker 3>really encourage the more ref,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reformist Muslims to get a broader,</v>

1551
01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>platform.</v>

1552
01:06:24.491 --> 01:06:26.020
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just not seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1553
01:06:26.021 --> 01:06:27.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've tried to do the little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

1554
01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:28.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've done a great job,</v>

1555
01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.250
<v Speaker 4>some reformers and some ex Muslims and </v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that,</v>

1556
01:06:31.251 --> 01:06:32.084
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly undercut by their own </v>

1557
01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.460
<v Speaker 4>supposedly their own people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.810
<v Speaker 4>I left every time is one of them talks </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>

1559
01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:42.090
<v Speaker 4>They say you're a sellout or you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure evil or you know,</v>

1560
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.850
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It</v>

1561
01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:45.110
<v Speaker 3>does beg the question like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

1562
01:06:45.111 --> 01:06:49.150
<v Speaker 3>the center of their faith is the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>intolerant city in the world.</v>

1563
01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:50.373
<v Speaker 3>Like someone's got to take a broad stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>against that and maybe we'll see it in </v>

1564
01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:55.000
<v Speaker 3>the next hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how much had been some on,</v>

1565
01:06:55.001 --> 01:06:55.834
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new crown prince of Saudi Arabia is </v>

1566
01:06:56.681 --> 01:06:58.330
<v Speaker 3>trying to do some more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1567
01:06:58.331 --> 01:06:59.164
<v Speaker 3>modern changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're also seeing extraordinary </v>

1568
01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:04.300
<v Speaker 3>radical voices in Saudi Arabia </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually rise up.</v>

1569
01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.340
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing protests in a ran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great,</v>

1570
01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:07.443
<v Speaker 3>but then you're seeing a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>western world not stand with these </v>

1571
01:07:08.951 --> 01:07:09.784
<v Speaker 3>protests or see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>president trump has done a great job of </v>

1572
01:07:10.931 --> 01:07:12.730
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama who was totally silent.</v>

1573
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:14.860
<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam in general.</v>

1574
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1575
01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:16.693
<v Speaker 3>there's wonderful Muslim friends that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have and productive members of the </v>

1576
01:07:19.241 --> 01:07:20.074
<v Speaker 3>American community that embrace this </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that you can hold your beliefs </v>

1577
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.150
<v Speaker 3>without having to have them push through</v>
<v Speaker 3>estate,</v>

1578
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.500
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>

1579
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.990
<v Speaker 3>But you're also seeing the exact </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite with the,</v>

1580
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:29.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Muslim Brotherhood taking further </v>

1581
01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:32.950
<v Speaker 3>root in Egypt and in Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing,</v>

1582
01:07:32.951 --> 01:07:33.784
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia want to continue its </v>

1583
01:07:34.631 --> 01:07:36.250
<v Speaker 3>influence throughout the Arabian </v>
<v Speaker 3>peninsula.</v>

1584
01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.980
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be a conflict of ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the largest religion,</v>

1585
01:07:38.981 --> 01:07:40.510
<v Speaker 3>I believe in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct me if I'm wrong.</v>

1586
01:07:40.511 --> 01:07:41.344
<v Speaker 3>1.2</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion people Christianity's right up </v>

1587
01:07:42.911 --> 01:07:43.744
<v Speaker 3>against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would argue that Islam has a lot </v>

1588
01:07:44.741 --> 01:07:46.810
<v Speaker 3>more power in countries and Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

1589
01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:47.843
<v Speaker 3>It's a reformation that needs to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is the demographic time bomb and in </v>

1590
01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it already too late?</v>

1591
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.060
<v Speaker 3>It's troubling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very troubling.</v>

1592
01:07:55.061 --> 01:07:55.894
<v Speaker 3>So as a byproduct of supporting social </v>
<v Speaker 3>welfare programs and the sixties and </v>

1593
01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:03.580
<v Speaker 3>seventies that deteriorated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the influence of the Catholic Church and</v>

1594
01:08:03.581 --> 01:08:07.030
<v Speaker 3>in protestantism throughout Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and really just kind of making people so</v>

1595
01:08:07.031 --> 01:08:10.870
<v Speaker 3>apathetic towards private philanthropy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apathetic towards value creation,</v>

1596
01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:11.704
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurship rates disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you really created a lazy European </v>

1597
01:08:13.811 --> 01:08:14.290
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

1598
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.123
<v Speaker 3>Hate to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are not highly productive </v>

1599
01:08:16.431 --> 01:08:17.990
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take the month of August off,</v>

1600
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.600
<v Speaker 3>they have very little ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're okay being average.</v>

1601
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:22.010
<v Speaker 3>That's not the society I want to live </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1602
01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:24.770
<v Speaker 3>America's always been aspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been the most productive.</v>

1603
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:26.590
<v Speaker 3>We've been the risk takers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been the,</v>

1604
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.820
<v Speaker 3>we've been the entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because of that,</v>

1605
01:08:28.821 --> 01:08:29.654
<v Speaker 3>they've laid themselves to be remarkably</v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable to a takeover culturally and </v>

1606
01:08:33.561 --> 01:08:35.780
<v Speaker 3>demographically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're starting to see that with the</v>

1607
01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:36.614
<v Speaker 3>millions of relocations from the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>East of people that don't hold these </v>

1608
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:39.884
<v Speaker 3>views that the Europeans hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And honestly they come from a </v>

1609
01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:42.674
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it be Syria or Jordan or Yemen </v>

1610
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:45.381
<v Speaker 3>or Oman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yemen,</v>

1611
01:08:45.381 --> 01:08:47.120
<v Speaker 3>there's a huge humanitarian crisis </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

1612
01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:50.450
<v Speaker 3>They've known nothing but government </v>
<v Speaker 3>being Islamic.</v>

1613
01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:51.643
<v Speaker 3>And so they inherently support that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they want to go through a </v>

1614
01:08:54.151 --> 01:08:56.150
<v Speaker 3>reformation and they can demonstrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can do that.</v>

1615
01:08:56.151 --> 01:08:56.740
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1616
01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:57.290
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1617
01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:58.123
<v Speaker 3>I'm not seeing that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing vast demographic clashes </v>

1618
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.730
<v Speaker 3>happening all throughout Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also an interesting generational</v>

1619
01:09:04.731 --> 01:09:06.740
<v Speaker 3>piece to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that you find that a lot of the</v>

1620
01:09:06.741 --> 01:09:09.980
<v Speaker 3>older people that came from those </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>

1621
01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years ago,</v>

1622
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:12.583
<v Speaker 3>they actually are more westernized in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their total drain are now they're sort </v>

1623
01:09:15.711 --> 01:09:16.544
<v Speaker 3>of making up that there was something </v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginarily great about Saddam that's </v>

1624
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Out where their parents and we need to,</v>

1625
01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:22.484
<v Speaker 3>we need to reform the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you rebuild the califate and very </v>

1626
01:09:25.401 --> 01:09:26.510
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1627
01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:27.344
<v Speaker 3>And so you look at the reformation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity right rightfully went </v>

1628
01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:34.430
<v Speaker 3>through in the 1500 and 1,617</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds it's as soon as you embrace the</v>

1629
01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:35.264
<v Speaker 3>idea of personal freedom and individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberty and you try to restrict the </v>

1630
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:39.260
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So put your,</v>

1631
01:09:39.261 --> 01:09:41.090
<v Speaker 3>put yourself in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1632
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.013
<v Speaker 3>in the seat of the founding fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They intentionally removed any sort of </v>

1633
01:09:46.191 --> 01:09:49.010
<v Speaker 3>mention of Christian dumb in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitution,</v>

1634
01:09:49.011 --> 01:09:50.930
<v Speaker 3>which ended up being the best thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>

1635
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:52.880
<v Speaker 3>which created the most Christian nation </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

1636
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.980
<v Speaker 3>It does America think about how ironic </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

1637
01:09:54.981 --> 01:09:57.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Europe didn't always do that.</v>

1638
01:09:57.081 --> 01:10:00.920
<v Speaker 3>They actually created these theocratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>governments that led way to,</v>

1639
01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible conflict and you know,</v>

1640
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:06.560
<v Speaker 3>ethno nationalism and eventually in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties and seventies like I mentioned,</v>

1641
01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:09.200
<v Speaker 3>the huge proliferation of the welfare </v>
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>

1642
01:10:09.201 --> 01:10:11.330
<v Speaker 3>which was the worst decision Europe ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>

1643
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:15.050
<v Speaker 3>They turned a highly productive people </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a mediocre,</v>

1644
01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Lazy Society that rejected all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and any sort of,</v>

1645
01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:20.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>connection to higher being and has now </v>

1646
01:10:22.401 --> 01:10:25.490
<v Speaker 3>led themselves to a demographic takeover</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think is the worst.</v>

1647
01:10:25.491 --> 01:10:28.220
<v Speaker 3>Some people think it's for the better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't see any evidence of that.</v>

1648
01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:30.040
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing,</v>

1649
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>

1650
01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.433
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get criticized as being a racist and </v>

1651
01:10:32.751 --> 01:10:33.584
<v Speaker 3>all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about a set of ideas </v>

1652
01:10:35.811 --> 01:10:39.890
<v Speaker 3>that when implemented through the state </v>
<v Speaker 3>have proven to be extremely dangerous to</v>

1653
01:10:39.891 --> 01:10:40.724
<v Speaker 3>human rights and economic productivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and private property rights and really </v>

1654
01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:45.441
<v Speaker 3>cumin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1655
01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:46.250
<v Speaker 3>human dignity.</v>

1656
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:48.950
<v Speaker 3>So when you've mentioned the phrase </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppression Olympics a couple of times,</v>

1657
01:10:48.951 --> 01:10:51.620
<v Speaker 3>which obviously I totally buy in on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is from your video,</v>

1658
01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:52.790
<v Speaker 3>I stole it from you by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1659
01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:53.653
<v Speaker 3>I think I stole it from Faisal site on </v>
<v Speaker 3>guitars and he probably stole it from </v>

1660
01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how these ideas get around.</v>

1661
01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.900
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of this,</v>

1662
01:10:59.901 --> 01:11:02.210
<v Speaker 3>this intersectional nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is all nonsense,</v>

1663
01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.153
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that the average left </v>

1664
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:09.300
<v Speaker 3>person in America that says they're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminist and therefore,</v>

1665
01:11:09.301 --> 01:11:10.134
<v Speaker 3>what do you think that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize any of the stuff that just </v>

1666
01:11:13.261 --> 01:11:14.094
<v Speaker 3>said about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously don't talk about it or they </v>

1667
01:11:15.761 --> 01:11:16.470
<v Speaker 3>might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might,</v>

1668
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Speaker 3>they might recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might know about it.</v>

1669
01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:20.760
<v Speaker 3>They might be able to answer it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trivial pursuit game.</v>

1670
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:23.370
<v Speaker 3>But the question is here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your,</v>

1671
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:25.350
<v Speaker 3>there's the international feminist </v>
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>

1672
01:11:25.351 --> 01:11:27.630
<v Speaker 3>which is growing huge on campus and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>always challenge them.</v>

1673
01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:28.883
<v Speaker 3>They advocate for women's rights across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and then they're like right </v>

1674
01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:33.780
<v Speaker 3>next to like the Muslim student </v>
<v Speaker 3>association,</v>

1675
01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:35.130
<v Speaker 3>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should be friends.</v>

1676
01:11:35.131 --> 01:11:35.964
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1677
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:36.833
<v Speaker 3>but why are they not demonstrating wide </v>
<v Speaker 3>said pr widespread protests against how </v>

1678
01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:40.194
<v Speaker 3>women are treated in Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the international feminist society </v>

1679
01:11:43.151 --> 01:11:46.290
<v Speaker 3>is protesting for against Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>

1680
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:48.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like because intersectionality,</v>

1681
01:11:48.091 --> 01:11:48.924
<v Speaker 3>it's like they have this weird construct</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we must advocate against Israel </v>

1682
01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:54.480
<v Speaker 3>because Israel is a friend of America </v>
<v Speaker 3>and America hates women.</v>

1683
01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:57.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

1684
01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I need like this big map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where they kind of try,</v>

1685
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:03.890
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but where is the outrage?</v>

1686
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:05.370
<v Speaker 3>They say there's outrage when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenged them.</v>

1687
01:12:05.371 --> 01:12:06.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're really outraged about it.</v>

1688
01:12:06.571 --> 01:12:07.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1689
01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:07.970
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

1690
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:08.491
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1691
01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:09.480
<v Speaker 3>where's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the,</v>

1692
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.310
<v Speaker 3>where's the Oprah Winfrey's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1693
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Where's the Hillary Clinton's who spoke </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple times and Saudi Arabia and took</v>

1694
01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:16.200
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars from them.</v>

1695
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're women can't drive where women can,</v>

1696
01:12:18.661 --> 01:12:21.090
<v Speaker 3>we now that can drive and that's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a real disaster,</v>

1697
01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:21.870
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1698
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:25.770
<v Speaker 3>it is because all of a sudden they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just wait for the moms to get your hands</v>

1699
01:12:25.771 --> 01:12:26.460
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hands up there.</v>

1700
01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:27.540
<v Speaker 3>The women are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

1701
01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:28.693
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're going to have a total </v>

1702
01:12:29.101 --> 01:12:29.934
<v Speaker 3>religious clash about this because Hamad</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been some say it's said by decree </v>

1703
01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:34.283
<v Speaker 3>that women can drive and there's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be all these religious </v>

1704
01:12:35.671 --> 01:12:36.504
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalists that are not gonna allow</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to happen and it's going to be a </v>

1705
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:39.623
<v Speaker 3>total conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were bragging that women are </v>

1706
01:12:40.471 --> 01:12:44.250
<v Speaker 3>allowed to go to movies now like that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>show you how medieval Saudi Arabia's,</v>

1707
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:44.971
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

1708
01:12:44.971 --> 01:12:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton made this like her </v>
<v Speaker 3>pinnacle,</v>

1709
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point of her campaign is like,</v>

1710
01:12:48.871 --> 01:12:50.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to really have good relations </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Saudi Arabia.</v>

1711
01:12:50.971 --> 01:12:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Her Foundation took tens of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

1712
01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Here was a woman that ran on the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like feminist representation.</v>

1713
01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:58.943
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she can't critique Saudi Arabia </v>

1714
01:13:00.901 --> 01:13:01.950
<v Speaker 3>once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1715
01:13:01.951 --> 01:13:04.260
<v Speaker 3>But she critiques Israel for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>settlements.</v>

1716
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:05.183
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's unbelievable </v>

1717
01:13:05.971 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 3>hypocrisy there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just Saudi Arabia,</v>

1718
01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:09.780
<v Speaker 3>which I'm focusing on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Egypt.</v>

1719
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a rant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Iraq,</v>

1720
01:13:11.491 --> 01:13:12.780
<v Speaker 3>which is changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Syria,</v>

1721
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.310
<v Speaker 3>it's Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's on mine.</v>

1722
01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:15.930
<v Speaker 3>It's Yemen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only countries that get it.</v>

1723
01:13:15.931 --> 01:13:16.764
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or Katar.</v>

1724
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe the UAE.</v>

1725
01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.950
<v Speaker 3>But you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a geographic dis,</v>

1726
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:21.813
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disposition of hundreds of millions of </v>

1727
01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:27.990
<v Speaker 3>square miles where women cannot vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women cannot own property.</v>

1728
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Women cannot start businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women cannot serve in government.</v>

1729
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:33.780
<v Speaker 3>Men have total and absolute control over</v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

1730
01:13:33.781 --> 01:13:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Gays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked [inaudible] shot.</v>

1731
01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:36.084
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

1732
01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:37.500
<v Speaker 3>how do you treat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't have it.</v>

1733
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:38.070
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1734
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.903
<v Speaker 3>How do you treat gays and your society?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do not have homosexuals in our </v>

1735
01:13:40.831 --> 01:13:41.330
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1736
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:42.840
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the,</v>

1737
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:46.350
<v Speaker 3>where's the LGBT international society </v>
<v Speaker 3>protesting against that,</v>

1738
01:13:46.351 --> 01:13:46.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like they have this kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>handshake,</v>

1740
01:13:48.931 --> 01:13:49.764
<v Speaker 3>like we're not going to mention this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all good that I can't stand </v>

1741
01:13:51.571 --> 01:13:52.890
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what?</v>

1742
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:53.724
<v Speaker 3>What country did they hate the most?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it's Israel where they were </v>

1743
01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:59.280
<v Speaker 3>days are open or openly productive </v>
<v Speaker 3>members of society.</v>

1744
01:13:59.281 --> 01:14:00.780
<v Speaker 3>I think they can marry in Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure,</v>

1745
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:01.883
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the West has been the best to women and </v>

1746
01:14:05.401 --> 01:14:09.330
<v Speaker 3>to gays and yet they want to destroy the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>

1747
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1748
01:14:12.041 --> 01:14:12.874
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned settlements a minute ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that Jesus guy you referenced </v>

1749
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:15.544
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived in a town called Bethlehem and </v>

1750
01:14:16.631 --> 01:14:19.380
<v Speaker 3>where he was born in that lands in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>West Bank.</v>

1751
01:14:19.381 --> 01:14:20.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1752
01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:22.480
<v Speaker 3>Jesus of Nazareth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Minor details here,</v>

1753
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:23.343
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1754
01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:25.420
<v Speaker 3>History though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just lost on people,</v>

1755
01:14:25.421 --> 01:14:25.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1756
01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:26.493
<v Speaker 3>Is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me that's one of the most horrible </v>

1757
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:28.603
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't know basics about history </v>

1758
01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:33.100
<v Speaker 3>and even it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the basics,</v>

1759
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:36.140
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like the ignorance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding the,</v>

1760
01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:39.820
<v Speaker 3>the blessings we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the live in western civilization and how</v>

1761
01:14:39.821 --> 01:14:40.654
<v Speaker 3>unique what we really have here as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>country and it's being taught in our </v>

1762
01:14:43.551 --> 01:14:46.040
<v Speaker 3>universities how America is a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>xenophobic,</v>

1763
01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 3>imperialist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible country,</v>

1764
01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:48.693
<v Speaker 3>and you really have to try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes effort to try to make that </v>

1765
01:14:50.891 --> 01:14:54.970
<v Speaker 3>argument because America has been one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest,</v>

1766
01:14:54.971 --> 01:14:55.804
<v Speaker 3>if not one of the greatest ideas ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>implemented in human history and civil </v>

1767
01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:01.270
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's had more respect for human rights.</v>

1768
01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:02.283
<v Speaker 3>Instead more economic productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have freed more people from serfdom </v>

1769
01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:09.850
<v Speaker 3>and from bondage in any other country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We voluntarily sent our citizens and our</v>

1770
01:15:09.851 --> 01:15:10.684
<v Speaker 3>civilians and our soldiers to die for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the freedoms of others not asking for </v>

1771
01:15:13.631 --> 01:15:14.620
<v Speaker 3>anything in return.</v>

1772
01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.240
<v Speaker 3>You look at the Korean War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we send,</v>

1773
01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our boys from Iowa,</v>

1774
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:18.664
<v Speaker 3>Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>South Carolina and Florida to go die in </v>

1775
01:15:19.871 --> 01:15:21.310
<v Speaker 3>the Korean Peninsula,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50,000</v>

1776
01:15:21.311 --> 01:15:22.144
<v Speaker 3>of them so that South Korea can exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We asked for nothing in return if we </v>

1777
01:15:24.761 --> 01:15:27.280
<v Speaker 3>were in pure lists where the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>imperialist ever.</v>

1778
01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:30.550
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so yet it takes the effort to really</v>

1779
01:15:30.551 --> 01:15:31.384
<v Speaker 3>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at history and say that we're a </v>

1780
01:15:32.381 --> 01:15:33.214
<v Speaker 3>horrible place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is what the modern American </v>

1781
01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:36.124
<v Speaker 3>left is trying to do is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember when I send the beginning of </v>

1782
01:15:37.991 --> 01:15:39.100
<v Speaker 3>the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a choice.</v>

1783
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:40.263
<v Speaker 3>We can either go the way of Europe and </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally fundamentally transform this </v>

1784
01:15:43.241 --> 01:15:45.280
<v Speaker 3>country and embrace a set of ideas we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>never had.</v>

1785
01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:46.323
<v Speaker 3>Or we can defend respect and advanced </v>
<v Speaker 3>American ideas here and really try to </v>

1786
01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:51.610
<v Speaker 3>make the 21st century the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>who've ever had.</v>

1787
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Is there an inherent risk in some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that though that yes,</v>

1788
01:15:55.031 --> 01:15:57.060
<v Speaker 3>there are things like South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that workout.</v>

1789
01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.290
<v Speaker 3>There's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's on foreign policy.</v>

1790
01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:01.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of instances we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

1791
01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.030
<v Speaker 3>we tried the kinds of blunders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'll,</v>

1792
01:16:03.031 --> 01:16:05.680
<v Speaker 3>rack war was a total mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a disaster.</v>

1793
01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:08.830
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's just the inherent risk in this</v>

1794
01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:09.880
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1795
01:16:09.881 --> 01:16:10.714
<v Speaker 3>That was sanctioned by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by Congress and the Senate and sure the </v>

1796
01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:13.600
<v Speaker 3>united,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't,</v>

1797
01:16:13.601 --> 01:16:16.300
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't actually an effect of war of </v>
<v Speaker 3>authorization.</v>

1798
01:16:16.301 --> 01:16:17.134
<v Speaker 3>It was a conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so what I meant there is a broader </v>

1799
01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:19.624
<v Speaker 3>point that throughout the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 3>America has stepped up and fought for </v>

1800
01:16:22.481 --> 01:16:24.880
<v Speaker 3>the freedom and liberty of others I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever asking for something in return.</v>

1801
01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I would argue that Iraq was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a horrible response to nine 11.</v>

1802
01:16:29.321 --> 01:16:30.154
<v Speaker 3>It had nothing to do with the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>existential threats against the </v>

1803
01:16:32.261 --> 01:16:34.360
<v Speaker 3>homeland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was George W.</v>

1804
01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Bush trying to rectify a mistake that </v>
<v Speaker 3>his father didn't actually make,</v>

1805
01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.170
<v Speaker 3>which was takeover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1806
01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:39.430
<v Speaker 3>Saddam Hussein's empire.</v>

1807
01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.890
<v Speaker 3>We got next to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We lost 30,000</v>

1808
01:16:41.891 --> 01:16:44.890
<v Speaker 3>American troops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We spent $2 trillion we didn't have,</v>

1809
01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.160
<v Speaker 3>and we helped create isis to boot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1810
01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.213
<v Speaker 3>so imposing American ideas worldwide is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not something that I would have ever </v>

1811
01:16:51.881 --> 01:16:53.560
<v Speaker 3>advocated for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but argue what,</v>

1812
01:16:53.561 --> 01:16:55.000
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the chips are down.</v>

1813
01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:56.140
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1814
01:16:56.141 --> 01:16:56.974
<v Speaker 3>in World War II and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nazi empire is on the March and </v>

1815
01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.920
<v Speaker 3>they're 16 miles away from Moscow and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1816
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Winston Churchill is on his hands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>knees begging FDR to send troops.</v>

1817
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Then we send,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1818
01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.880
<v Speaker 3>half million ground troops to go through</v>
<v Speaker 3>Normandy.</v>

1819
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:11.990
<v Speaker 3>We stepped up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1820
01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:15.320
<v Speaker 3>And we help push back European fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>

1821
01:17:15.321 --> 01:17:16.154
<v Speaker 3>there's been a lot of mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of our incursions in Central </v>

1822
01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:21.290
<v Speaker 3>America were total disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but net positive America's,</v>

1823
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:22.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1824
01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.470
<v Speaker 3>decisions throughout the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 3>have helped,</v>

1825
01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>advanced human freedom and,</v>

1826
01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.860
<v Speaker 3>and release people from bondage.</v>

1827
01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.753
<v Speaker 4>So to that end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must love what trump's dealing with </v>

1828
01:17:30.381 --> 01:17:31.100
<v Speaker 4>the UN,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1829
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:31.881
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fantastic.</v>

1830
01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:33.440
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really is a freaking all stars.</v>

1831
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I love about Nikki Haley to </v>
<v Speaker 3>my left is people watching this.</v>

1832
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:40.940
<v Speaker 3>How can you not recognize she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything you pretend to advocate for?</v>

1833
01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:41.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1834
01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.350
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she's,</v>

1835
01:17:42.351 --> 01:17:44.000
<v Speaker 3>she's a son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter of an immigrant.</v>

1836
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.990
<v Speaker 3>She's a minority and she's Indian like </v>
<v Speaker 3>from actual India.</v>

1837
01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is one of their,</v>

1838
01:17:49.101 --> 01:17:50.810
<v Speaker 3>I think oppression Olympics groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1839
01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:51.723
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you saw this thing like a couple of </v>

1840
01:17:51.951 --> 01:17:54.370
<v Speaker 4>weeks ago where they were trying to mock</v>
<v Speaker 4>her for using the name Nikki,</v>

1841
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.610
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what her parents call.</v>

1842
01:17:56.650 --> 01:17:57.483
<v Speaker 3>I know me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if a Republican said that </v>

1843
01:17:59.111 --> 01:18:01.840
<v Speaker 3>there'd be March.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's totally self made.</v>

1844
01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.600
<v Speaker 3>Her father literally owned convenience </v>
<v Speaker 3>stores,</v>

1845
01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:08.800
<v Speaker 3>started at as state senator ran as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>insurgent for governor twice elected,</v>

1846
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:11.860
<v Speaker 3>eradicated the confederate flag from her</v>
<v Speaker 3>State Capitol,</v>

1847
01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:12.933
<v Speaker 3>balanced the budget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>created South Carolina into this </v>

1848
01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:17.770
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably prosperous state in a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated political state.</v>

1849
01:18:17.771 --> 01:18:18.490
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1850
01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:19.151
<v Speaker 3>they always said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1851
01:18:19.151 --> 01:18:20.230
<v Speaker 3>the south is so racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1852
01:18:20.231 --> 01:18:22.170
<v Speaker 3>they help twice elected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1853
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:23.103
<v Speaker 3>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>minority governor of a state that you </v>

1854
01:18:25.241 --> 01:18:26.110
<v Speaker 3>call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1855
01:18:26.111 --> 01:18:27.100
<v Speaker 3>the new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1856
01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:28.120
<v Speaker 3>confederacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1857
01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.100
<v Speaker 3>Tim Scott Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1858
01:18:30.101 --> 01:18:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the only,</v>

1859
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:32.323
<v Speaker 3>there's only two African American </v>
<v Speaker 3>senators and one of them's from what </v>

1860
01:18:33.791 --> 01:18:35.380
<v Speaker 3>they call one of the most racist states </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the country.</v>

1861
01:18:35.381 --> 01:18:36.214
<v Speaker 3>That's beside the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:18:36.370 --> 01:18:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Then she gets selected by president </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump who supposedly hates women,</v>

1863
01:18:39.071 --> 01:18:39.904
<v Speaker 3>but he has a represent us in the UN to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go fiercely fight against all these </v>

1864
01:18:42.941 --> 01:18:46.330
<v Speaker 3>globalists forces at the UN cuts aid to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Pakistan.</v>

1865
01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.790
<v Speaker 3>She is what the left is supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>

1866
01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is the,</v>

1867
01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:53.920
<v Speaker 3>she is this absolute bodymind of modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>day feminism.</v>

1868
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:55.103
<v Speaker 3>Yet they hate her.</v>

1869
01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.970
<v Speaker 4>Did you see this tweet the other day by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the at Democrats?</v>

1870
01:18:57.971 --> 01:18:58.920
<v Speaker 4>You know the official,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1871
01:18:58.921 --> 01:19:01.870
<v Speaker 4>well all the check marks women have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>qualified woman.</v>

1872
01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:03.850
<v Speaker 4>But the bet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that of course that's the,</v>

1873
01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.720
<v Speaker 4>that's like the blanket response but the</v>
<v Speaker 4>best was so it was like,</v>

1874
01:19:07.721 --> 01:19:09.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do minority women and Brown women,</v>

1875
01:19:09.821 --> 01:19:12.880
<v Speaker 4>but the amount of people who just wrote </v>
<v Speaker 4>it all right,</v>

1876
01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:14.860
<v Speaker 4>you're endorsing Nikki Haley and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1877
01:19:14.861 --> 01:19:15.880
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys,</v>

1878
01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:17.960
<v Speaker 4>this is what you idiots have created.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1879
01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.021
<v Speaker 3>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>

1880
01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:19.854
<v Speaker 3>And I can't tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting because so many </v>

1881
01:19:21.681 --> 01:19:23.960
<v Speaker 3>of our turning point members and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>turning points students,</v>

1882
01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.160
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you conservative?</v>

1883
01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:26.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm a student.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not concerned because of the left.</v>

1884
01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.393
<v Speaker 3>I left the left because the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they have lost their freaking </v>

1885
01:19:31.581 --> 01:19:32.414
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they were just like normal </v>

1886
01:19:33.951 --> 01:19:34.784
<v Speaker 3>democrats and didn't say the stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and an intersectionality politics </v>

1887
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:40.880
<v Speaker 3>and like they argued like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we can run govern better,</v>

1888
01:19:40.881 --> 01:19:43.010
<v Speaker 3>but free enterprise is a good thing but </v>
<v Speaker 3>flawed and we need pr.</v>

1889
01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.290
<v Speaker 3>We need to perfect it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1890
01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:46.124
<v Speaker 3>if they actually had some humility for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it instead of just like embracing </v>

1891
01:19:48.411 --> 01:19:50.960
<v Speaker 3>cultural Marxism and doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppression Olympics,</v>

1892
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I think you might still be on the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead they created the greatest gift.</v>

1893
01:19:55.641 --> 01:19:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Thank you liberals for doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftist.</v>

1894
01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:58.413
<v Speaker 3>Cause now we have like former Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sanders supporters running our chapters </v>

1895
01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:02.023
<v Speaker 3>because they are now cultural marxists </v>
<v Speaker 3>that look at people at the color of </v>

1896
01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:07.650
<v Speaker 3>their skin by how much value they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world or how great can understand</v>

1897
01:20:07.651 --> 01:20:08.550
<v Speaker 3>someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1898
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:09.420
<v Speaker 3>v,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1899
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.253
<v Speaker 3>degree of suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is everything that Martin Luther </v>

1900
01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:13.643
<v Speaker 3>King argued against,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is everything that is </v>

1901
01:20:14.821 --> 01:20:16.620
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally created this country.</v>

1902
01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.350
<v Speaker 3>And so thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Left us for helping create this movement</v>

1903
01:20:19.351 --> 01:20:21.540
<v Speaker 3>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are there any good Democrats left?</v>

1904
01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:22.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1905
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:23.123
<v Speaker 3>I have my issues with plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans and I'd be more should of a </v>

1906
01:20:25.141 --> 01:20:28.930
<v Speaker 3>rand Paul Republican and a libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>on board join the,</v>

1907
01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:29.370
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1908
01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:30.203
<v Speaker 3>I call it on the sif evil empire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could join the resist the real </v>

1909
01:20:32.431 --> 01:20:33.630
<v Speaker 3>results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real resistance.</v>

1910
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:34.523
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look for the stuff that I like about </v>

1911
01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Rand Abi at Rand Paul obviously has all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Libertarians of course,</v>

1912
01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:41.610
<v Speaker 3>sadly in that collection of 18 people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were running against trump,</v>

1913
01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:42.563
<v Speaker 3>he was seemingly on the wrong stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the party had nothing to do </v>

1914
01:20:45.331 --> 01:20:46.920
<v Speaker 3>with that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he wanted.</v>

1915
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.390
<v Speaker 3>Even if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you've said before,</v>

1916
01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.233
<v Speaker 3>trump may be doing a lot of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things right now we show you how </v>

1917
01:20:51.741 --> 01:20:54.140
<v Speaker 3>complex this whole very convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1918
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:56.340
<v Speaker 3>the question I think you had was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1919
01:20:56.370 --> 01:20:57.780
<v Speaker 3>but the new generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like who do I need?</v>

1920
01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.970
<v Speaker 3>Good Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there anyone now that you can,</v>

1921
01:20:59.971 --> 01:21:00.860
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1922
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:01.703
<v Speaker 3>I'm still looking for that kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>blue dog Democrat to rise up and be </v>

1923
01:21:04.501 --> 01:21:05.910
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1924
01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:08.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is pro choice,</v>

1925
01:21:08.401 --> 01:21:10.770
<v Speaker 3>which I disagree with whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1926
01:21:10.771 --> 01:21:11.604
<v Speaker 3>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I still think America's a great </v>

1927
01:21:13.261 --> 01:21:17.190
<v Speaker 3>country and we need to like rid our con,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our country of Antifa.</v>

1928
01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:19.500
<v Speaker 3>Alan Dershowitz is probably the only one</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could think of right now.</v>

1929
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.393
<v Speaker 3>Who was built the way he's getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked out of the Democrat party buddy </v>

1930
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:23.143
<v Speaker 3>abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's taking them saying this every week </v>

1931
01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:26.940
<v Speaker 3>since when has it been a bad thing to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alan Dershowitz?</v>

1932
01:21:26.941 --> 01:21:28.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy is freaking brilliant.</v>

1933
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:29.663
<v Speaker 3>You might disagree with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's like the smartest lawyer and </v>

1934
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:34.740
<v Speaker 3>human rights attorney that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly find.</v>

1935
01:21:34.741 --> 01:21:35.574
<v Speaker 3>And now the Democrats have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's our cues being paid by the trump </v>

1936
01:21:37.951 --> 01:21:38.560
<v Speaker 3>camp parenting.</v>

1937
01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>

1938
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.063
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's brilliant and they're kicking them </v>

1939
01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.830
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that man.</v>

1940
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:45.390
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some good Democrats out there,</v>

1941
01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:46.283
<v Speaker 3>Charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect we could do this for a couple </v>

1942
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:49.830
<v Speaker 3>of more hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm only going to ask you one.</v>

1943
01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I want this on the record,</v>

1944
01:21:51.511 --> 01:21:53.070
<v Speaker 3>on this show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when it happens,</v>

1945
01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be that I asked at first,</v>

1946
01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.100
<v Speaker 3>you're going to run for Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1947
01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:01.440
<v Speaker 3>not for political office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>

1948
01:22:01.441 --> 01:22:06.441
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a commentator and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement driver.</v>

1949
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Does that have anything to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clown show that that running?</v>

1950
01:22:10.411 --> 01:22:11.244
<v Speaker 3>Is that a guy like you who you obviously</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a great understanding of the </v>

1951
01:22:13.681 --> 01:22:14.514
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a consistent line of thought </v>

1952
01:22:16.051 --> 01:22:17.880
<v Speaker 3>whether I agree with you on every far </v>
<v Speaker 3>too principled.</v>

1953
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.823
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something to be said for </v>

1954
01:22:20.521 --> 01:22:20.931
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1955
01:22:20.931 --> 01:22:24.220
<v Speaker 3>So I mean that goes to what coworker </v>
<v Speaker 3>said about he's the broker,</v>

1956
01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:24.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1957
01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.750
<v Speaker 3>But in all reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love what I got to do.</v>

1958
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:28.703
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like every day I get to create a </v>

1959
01:22:30.271 --> 01:22:31.890
<v Speaker 3>movement and helps facilitate a moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1960
01:22:31.891 --> 01:22:32.724
<v Speaker 3>create and say what I want to say and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to have conversations with you on </v>

1961
01:22:36.901 --> 01:22:37.734
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met very few Congress people or </v>

1962
01:22:40.321 --> 01:22:43.260
<v Speaker 3>senators or governors that actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy what they do seriously.</v>

1963
01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:44.483
<v Speaker 3>And it's always about meeting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>lobbyists or cow towing to leadership </v>

1964
01:22:46.741 --> 01:22:47.574
<v Speaker 3>and fundraising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just makes me sick to my stomach </v>

1965
01:22:48.781 --> 01:22:51.510
<v Speaker 3>thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let's pretend it was a great gig,</v>

1966
01:22:51.511 --> 01:22:52.344
<v Speaker 3>which some of them seem to like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why they liked the </v>

1967
01:22:54.961 --> 01:22:55.794
<v Speaker 3>corruption or something I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that really a place where I can do </v>

1968
01:22:58.171 --> 01:23:00.080
<v Speaker 3>the most amount of good for my </v>
<v Speaker 3>worldview?</v>

1969
01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:01.470
<v Speaker 3>And I would say probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1970
01:23:01.471 --> 01:23:03.060
<v Speaker 3>I'd say look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turning points,</v>

1971
01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:05.070
<v Speaker 3>doing a great service for the country.</v>

1972
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I think right now I love what I get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1973
01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.290
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1974
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 3>have some influence in helping shape </v>
<v Speaker 3>this policy in this agenda.</v>

1975
01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.080
<v Speaker 3>And that doesn't seem like fun to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1976
01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:16.840
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like that would maximize</v>
<v Speaker 3>my amount of happiness.</v>

1977
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1978
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:19.870
<v Speaker 3>well it's on the record now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on the record.</v>

1979
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:20.704
<v Speaker 3>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope I don't talk like a politician </v>

1980
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:25.580
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1981
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I think we're doing a gig together in </v>
<v Speaker 3>New Hampshire.</v>

1982
01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be fine.</v>

1983
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Not too long from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll,</v>

1984
01:23:29.751 --> 01:23:31.820
<v Speaker 3>when we get in canvas will be there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Canada's Owens.</v>

1985
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real quick.</v>

1986
01:23:33.101 --> 01:23:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1987
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Let's just finish talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>candidate I backhand is for a moment.</v>

1988
01:23:35.651 --> 01:23:37.810
<v Speaker 3>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I met you that day,</v>

1989
01:23:37.811 --> 01:23:39.910
<v Speaker 3>I referenced that and literally a minute</v>
<v Speaker 3>before you had,</v>

1990
01:23:39.911 --> 01:23:42.760
<v Speaker 3>I saw it from a distance you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can just talk for about two minutes.</v>

1991
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:44.410
<v Speaker 3>And then she walked over to me and she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1992
01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I just got a job with turning point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie wants me to,</v>

1993
01:23:47.351 --> 01:23:48.184
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>help talk to the black community and </v>

1994
01:23:49.151 --> 01:23:49.361
<v Speaker 3>Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1995
01:23:49.361 --> 01:23:50.194
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's quickly becoming an all star in </v>

1996
01:23:52.151 --> 01:23:52.984
<v Speaker 3>this space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she escaped some of the Youtube </v>

1997
01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:55.653
<v Speaker 3>Madness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm somewhat aware of and you may </v>

1998
01:23:57.341 --> 01:23:59.860
<v Speaker 3>have seen my insane debate with her and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Blair white and blah,</v>

1999
01:23:59.861 --> 01:24:00.694
<v Speaker 3>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's quickly becoming a real </v>

2000
01:24:02.531 --> 01:24:07.531
<v Speaker 3>powerhouse hodel voice because the black</v>
<v Speaker 3>community has needed more p,</v>

2001
01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:08.533
<v Speaker 3>you know the Thomas Souls that Larry </v>
<v Speaker 3>Elders and David Webb's and who have </v>

2002
01:24:12.551 --> 01:24:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Allen West,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever else there,</v>

2003
01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:14.643
<v Speaker 3>it's a different generation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's coming at it from the firm at </v>

2004
01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:18.250
<v Speaker 3>young place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of beautiful.</v>

2005
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:19.243
<v Speaker 3>She's unbelievably talented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm spent a considerable amount of time </v>

2006
01:24:21.941 --> 01:24:24.310
<v Speaker 3>with her now minus the five minutes I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hired her,</v>

2007
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.670
<v Speaker 3>but she's a passionate driven person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look broader than that.</v>

2008
01:24:27.850 --> 01:24:28.683
<v Speaker 3>She like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all of us on our team believe and </v>

2009
01:24:31.511 --> 01:24:32.344
<v Speaker 3>understand there is a movement happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country and it's something the </v>

2010
01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:36.404
<v Speaker 3>media will not report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something palpable when you </v>

2011
01:24:37.961 --> 01:24:39.370
<v Speaker 3>experience it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw it in Florida.</v>

2012
01:24:39.371 --> 01:24:40.720
<v Speaker 3>There's something happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

2013
01:24:40.721 --> 01:24:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2014
01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:42.673
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost squaws I spiritual </v>

2015
01:24:45.011 --> 01:24:45.640
<v Speaker 3>political.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2016
01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:46.473
<v Speaker 3>there's something happening because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left has tried for far too long to </v>

2017
01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:53.440
<v Speaker 3>suppress the movement of ideas and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>free speech and dialog and discussion.</v>

2018
01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:56.110
<v Speaker 3>But what candace believes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm in full support of,</v>

2019
01:24:56.111 --> 01:24:57.730
<v Speaker 3>and I want to help her in every way </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>

2020
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
<v Speaker 3>is that the African American community </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been totally,</v>

2021
01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:02.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dis served,</v>

2022
01:25:02.410 --> 01:25:03.243
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better term by the modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party and that they are </v>

2023
01:25:06.071 --> 01:25:06.904
<v Speaker 3>disproportionately more poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're disproportionally in worse </v>

2024
01:25:08.951 --> 01:25:12.070
<v Speaker 3>circumstances than people of every other</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethnic or racial group.</v>

2025
01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:12.933
<v Speaker 3>But why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not because Americans are more </v>

2026
01:25:14.471 --> 01:25:16.840
<v Speaker 3>racist country then we were in the 1960s</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

2027
01:25:16.841 --> 01:25:17.674
<v Speaker 3>no one with a straight face could </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly say that yet African Americans </v>

2028
01:25:19.751 --> 01:25:21.640
<v Speaker 3>are poor today than they were in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>1960s.</v>

2029
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.580
<v Speaker 3>So what happened to use a Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton term?</v>

2030
01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:28.570
<v Speaker 3>America did not get more racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>America got significantly less racist.</v>

2031
01:25:28.571 --> 01:25:29.404
<v Speaker 3>There's still racism in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of it has been eradicated if </v>

2032
01:25:31.721 --> 01:25:32.554
<v Speaker 3>not reversed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened is that we as Americans </v>

2033
01:25:36.091 --> 01:25:38.770
<v Speaker 3>supported one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2034
01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I would say contentious political and </v>
<v Speaker 3>social programs,</v>

2035
01:25:41.801 --> 01:25:42.634
<v Speaker 3>which was the great society where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>deincentivize the black community from </v>

2036
01:25:45.601 --> 01:25:46.434
<v Speaker 3>making good choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We incentivized women to say single and </v>

2037
01:25:49.661 --> 01:25:50.494
<v Speaker 3>have babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We destroyed public sector education by </v>

2038
01:25:53.831 --> 01:25:54.664
<v Speaker 3>reinforcing the public sector,</v>
<v Speaker 3>teacher unions and disallowing school </v>

2039
01:25:57.791 --> 01:25:58.624
<v Speaker 3>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm rewarding bad teachers and keeping </v>

2040
01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:02.800
<v Speaker 3>communities perpetually poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2041
01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.590
<v Speaker 3>we I think really did a disservice by </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2042
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:08.720
<v Speaker 3>starting this war on police in the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of years,</v>

2043
01:26:08.721 --> 01:26:09.554
<v Speaker 3>which most police officers are there for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the betterment of the communities that </v>

2044
01:26:11.871 --> 01:26:12.704
<v Speaker 3>they police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we have started this narrative that </v>

2045
01:26:14.361 --> 01:26:15.194
<v Speaker 3>America somehow an inherently racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>country and African Americans are poor </v>

2046
01:26:17.841 --> 01:26:19.010
<v Speaker 3>because we're a racist country.</v>

2047
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:22.340
<v Speaker 3>The data does not reflect that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because we have created a,</v>

2048
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:23.383
<v Speaker 3>a set of government policies and ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have not incentivized African </v>

2049
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:28.423
<v Speaker 3>Americans to continue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like make good choices that breakout of </v>

2050
01:26:30.021 --> 01:26:31.700
<v Speaker 3>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as Ben Shapiro says,</v>

2051
01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:35.630
<v Speaker 3>you make these three choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get married before you have kids,</v>

2052
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.280
<v Speaker 3>you graduate high school and you get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

2053
01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.740
<v Speaker 3>You can break out of poverty in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country and we,</v>

2054
01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.450
<v Speaker 3>and you can look to all three of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2055
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:42.583
<v Speaker 3>We have government programs that either </v>
<v Speaker 3>discouraged or deincentivize every one </v>

2056
01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:47.084
<v Speaker 3>of those choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for African American </v>

2057
01:26:48.291 --> 01:26:52.840
<v Speaker 3>community and candace growing up from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the poor family growing up as a,</v>

2058
01:26:52.841 --> 01:26:53.674
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>African American woman in this culture </v>

2059
01:26:54.971 --> 01:26:57.170
<v Speaker 3>and the society can talk about it a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>better than I can.</v>

2060
01:26:57.171 --> 01:26:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I can only talk about it from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>outsider.</v>

2061
01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:01.580
<v Speaker 3>She's an insider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in today's time unfortunately buys</v>

2062
01:27:01.581 --> 01:27:03.110
<v Speaker 3>you a lot more institutional </v>
<v Speaker 3>credibility,</v>

2063
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:04.220
<v Speaker 3>which it really shouldn't.</v>

2064
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:05.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the irony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2065
01:27:05.631 --> 01:27:06.464
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of using identity politics </v>

2066
01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:09.530
<v Speaker 3>against itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you almost half,</v>

2067
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:11.510
<v Speaker 3>which you almost have to do it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2068
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:12.620
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always say this,</v>

2069
01:27:12.621 --> 01:27:15.440
<v Speaker 3>if I say free enterprise is the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to solve poverty,</v>

2070
01:27:15.650 --> 01:27:16.483
<v Speaker 3>and candace says it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make it any more or less are </v>

2071
01:27:17.841 --> 01:27:19.640
<v Speaker 3>true just because she's a black woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2072
01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Truth is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter who says it,</v>

2073
01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:23.510
<v Speaker 3>but the left somehow has a value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2074
01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.433
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot higher of certain people saying </v>

2075
01:27:25.701 --> 01:27:26.450
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what,</v>

2076
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:28.370
<v Speaker 3>if identity politics is what we have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>play,</v>

2077
01:27:28.371 --> 01:27:30.770
<v Speaker 3>then so be it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And candace understands that,</v>

2078
01:27:30.771 --> 01:27:31.604
<v Speaker 3>especially on college campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black students will listen to her a lot </v>

2079
01:27:33.561 --> 01:27:34.394
<v Speaker 3>more likely than they'll listen to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I believe that she can continually </v>

2080
01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:38.084
<v Speaker 3>build a movement around these core set </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ideas and values and principles and </v>

2081
01:27:40.581 --> 01:27:41.150
<v Speaker 3>she gets it.</v>

2082
01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Cause she used to be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She used to be a leftist.</v>

2083
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:44.323
<v Speaker 3>She understands who these people are and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she understands how to fight them and </v>

2084
01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:46.994
<v Speaker 3>how to persuade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're lucky to have her as our </v>

2085
01:27:48.561 --> 01:27:50.690
<v Speaker 3>director of urban engagement at turning </v>
<v Speaker 3>point USA.</v>

2086
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:54.230
<v Speaker 3>I know you don't like drug references,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I had her on I said,</v>

2087
01:27:54.231 --> 01:27:56.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it was like the red pill is like,</v>

2088
01:27:56.481 --> 01:28:01.481
<v Speaker 3>I was like slowly drinking it like tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said she snorted it all the power to</v>

2089
01:28:02.931 --> 01:28:03.764
<v Speaker 3>hurt you as long as done in the harm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone else do whatever you want to do </v>

2090
01:28:05.631 --> 01:28:06.464
<v Speaker 3>with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want it to end with you in a slightly </v>

2091
01:28:08.121 --> 01:28:09.380
<v Speaker 3>awkward position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

2092
01:28:09.381 --> 01:28:10.790
<v Speaker 3>One of your employees that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>

2093
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:13.400
<v Speaker 3>It's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing great stuff.</v>

2094
01:28:13.401 --> 01:28:14.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking forward to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2095
01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:17.690
<v Speaker 3>getting out on the road with you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing.</v>

2096
01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:21.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm awesome at the end of that week </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you were smiling.</v>

2097
01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:22.460
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally,</v>

2098
01:28:22.461 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 3>at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could not smile anymore.</v>

2099
01:28:24.171 --> 01:28:24.830
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2100
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:26.270
<v Speaker 3>we're in our students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just great.</v>

2101
01:28:26.271 --> 01:28:27.104
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just,</v>

2102
01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:29.120
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking of standing ovations,</v>

2103
01:28:29.121 --> 01:28:30.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>candice got a massive,</v>

2104
01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.890
<v Speaker 3>massive ovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should be about a cent.</v>

2105
01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:34.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>

2106
01:28:34.190 --> 01:28:37.730
<v Speaker 3>that's the diversity of ideas is we will</v>
<v Speaker 3>give a standing ovation of people,</v>

2107
01:28:37.731 --> 01:28:41.150
<v Speaker 3>even if we don't agree with what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to say completely.</v>

2108
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:42.230
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2109
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:43.970
<v Speaker 3>the left won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2110
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:45.470
<v Speaker 3>get out of my room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of mice,</v>

2111
01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:46.940
<v Speaker 3>get out of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2112
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:48.200
<v Speaker 3>lecture hall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2113
01:28:48.201 --> 01:28:49.034
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a movement around true tolerance </v>

2114
01:28:50.630 --> 01:28:52.760
<v Speaker 3>and true discussion of ideas and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to win.</v>

2115
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.961
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
