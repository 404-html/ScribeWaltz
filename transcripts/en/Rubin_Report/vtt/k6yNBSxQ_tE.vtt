<v Speaker 1>use his studio today and the reason we </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do some stuff with you guys </v>

7
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>today is because I have Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gad Saad here.</v>

8
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:22.284
<v Speaker 1>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor of marketing at Concordia </v>

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.673
<v Speaker 1>University in Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada and he's the research chair in </v>

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary behavioral sciences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian consumption.</v>

11
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I normally don't use a teleprompter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I needed it for that get.</v>

12
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>

13
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

14
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

15
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.033
<v Speaker 1>First off Gad said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is my pronunciation of your last </v>

16
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:42.444
<v Speaker 1>name is Arabic and Arabic as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is a Hebrew name and sad as an </v>

17
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:48.654
<v Speaker 1>Arabic name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people can't say the guttural </v>

18
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>sounds and so it just gets an extended </v>
<v Speaker 1>ace.</v>

19
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you do it on your own videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>on youtube and you don't even do it with</v>

21
00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:59.830
<v Speaker 1>the guttural sound because I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to intimidate the viewers.</v>

22
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>That sound so a Hebrew first name Arabic</v>
<v Speaker 1>last night.</v>

23
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you must be very conflicted.</v>

24
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

25
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Lebanon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of the Jewish faith.</v>

26
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason that I wanted to bring you</v>

27
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>in and the timing of this really is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect,</v>

28
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.403
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because we connected sort of in the </v>

29
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.093
<v Speaker 1>last year and a half or so on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find ourselves often in the same </v>

30
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>twitter wars with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:25.134
<v Speaker 1>the atheists and the new atheists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the far left and the people on the </v>

32
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:28.764
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone that's always battling on </v>

33
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>twitter and we're usually on the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

34
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really what started this whole thing</v>

35
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:34.854
<v Speaker 1>was when Sam Harris was on real time </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Bill Maher and he and Ben Affleck </v>

36
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:41.424
<v Speaker 1>and bill got into a big frack is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at the clip and </v>

37
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>then we'll go from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

38
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.023
<v Speaker 2>So the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to talk about the courses that </v>

39
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:49.210
<v Speaker 2>you and I have been trying to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

40
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 2>I think I have any way that liberals </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to stand up for liberal principles.</v>

41
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.780
<v Speaker 2>This is what I stood on last week's </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

42
00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:56.614
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I got a lot of hate for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all I'm saying is that liberal </v>

43
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:00.694
<v Speaker 2>principles like freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom to practice any religion you </v>

44
00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:07.150
<v Speaker 2>want without fear of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom to leave a religion,</v>

45
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 2>equality for women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a quality for minorities,</v>

46
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.770
<v Speaker 2>including homosexuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are bit</v>

47
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 3>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>applaud for,</v>

48
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 3>but then when you done</v>

49
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 2>say in the Muslim world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's lacking,</v>

50
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 2>then they get upset.</v>

51
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.041
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

52
00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberals have really failed on the topic</v>

53
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 4>of theocracy that they'll criticize </v>
<v Speaker 4>white theocracy.</v>

54
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.963
<v Speaker 4>They'll criticize Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll still get agitated over the </v>

55
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:38.560
<v Speaker 4>abortion clinic bombing that happened in</v>
<v Speaker 4>1984,</v>

56
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.693
<v Speaker 4>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you want to talk about the </v>

57
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.244
<v Speaker 4>treatment of women and homosexuals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>free thinkers and public intellectuals </v>

58
00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:46.414
<v Speaker 4>in the Muslim world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would argue that the liberals have </v>

59
00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:51.070
<v Speaker 4>failed us and the crucial point</v>

60
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 3>confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 3>Thank God you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

62
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 3>the crucial point of confusion is is</v>

63
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.913
<v Speaker 4>that that we have been sold this meme of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Islamophobia where every criticism of </v>

64
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 4>the doctrine of Islam gets conflated </v>
<v Speaker 4>with bigotry toward Muslims as people.</v>

65
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 4>That is intellectually ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even.</v>

66
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.703
<v Speaker 4>It gets so hold on who that person who </v>
<v Speaker 4>understands the officially codified </v>

67
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.050
<v Speaker 4>doctrine of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>

68
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.903
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is actually well educated on this </v>

69
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.450
<v Speaker 4>topic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm asking you.</v>

70
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 4>You're saying if I criticize the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that Islamophobia is not a</v>

71
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 4>real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if you're critical of something,</v>

72
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.920
<v Speaker 4>it's not a real thing when we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

73
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 4>It's really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not denying that that certain people</v>

74
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.730
<v Speaker 4>are bigoted against Muslims as people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a problem big have you.</v>

75
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.800
<v Speaker 4>But the gross,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's racist and it's not.</v>

76
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 4>It's but it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

77
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.750
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like saying those years shifty.</v>

78
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 4>You're absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are saying you guys are saying if you</v>

79
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 4>want to be liberals believe in liberal </v>
<v Speaker 4>principles,</v>

80
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 4>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom of speech,</v>

81
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are endowed by our forefathers of the</v>

82
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 4>low trek.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All men are created new fan.</v>

83
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.930
<v Speaker 4>We have to be able to criticize bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

84
00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that clip goes on for about 10 </v>

85
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:01.974
<v Speaker 1>minutes and I showed you about two </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes right there and I think Sam hit </v>

86
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:08.490
<v Speaker 1>the point right at the end that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to criticize bad ideas.</v>

87
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:09.324
<v Speaker 1>And to me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a real schism and people on </v>

88
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:13.440
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm obviously on the left,</v>

89
00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I stand for liberal principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

90
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.663
<v Speaker 1>but this schism and this idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't criticize ideas without somehow </v>

91
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:25.980
<v Speaker 1>condemning a whole group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is a big point of contention</v>

92
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:27.300
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you walk us through that?</v>

93
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.333
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that people have </v>

94
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.160
<v Speaker 1>difficulty criticizing ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a specific idea,</v>

95
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:32.994
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see it everyday in my exchanges on </v>

96
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:37.410
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I criticize some Jewish practice,</v>

97
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I get many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many likes on facebook.</v>

98
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.080
<v Speaker 1>If I criticize some Hick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Republican senator about his,</v>

99
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.020
<v Speaker 1>his position on evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get tons of likes.</v>

100
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>But if I dare criticize something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

101
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:53.601
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a very quick example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put up a clip of a Iraqi scientist,</v>

102
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.403
<v Speaker 1>an astronomer who was arguing that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth is flat because it says so in the </v>

103
00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Koran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I received,</v>

104
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.140
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my facebook friends are academics</v>

105
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I received from a white sort of guilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>within academic from,</v>

106
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.190
<v Speaker 1>from California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a note saying,</v>

107
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:11.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

108
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.400
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you ganging up on these folks?</v>

109
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.383
<v Speaker 1>So she wasn't offended by the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Iraqi scientists was holding an </v>

110
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.313
<v Speaker 1>astonishingly outrageous view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was annoyed that I would actually </v>

111
00:05:22.861 --> 00:05:23.694
<v Speaker 1>point to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you think people have trouble </v>

112
00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:27.024
<v Speaker 1>making this distinction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very obvious to me as as an </v>

113
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.620
<v Speaker 1>outsider of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at,</v>

114
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I look at the book,</v>

115
00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:34.164
<v Speaker 1>you can say whatever you want about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and all the awful things that are </v>

116
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:38.190
<v Speaker 1>in the Old Testament and the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>testament or the Koran.</v>

117
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really read any of them.</v>

118
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their books,</v>

119
00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:43.320
<v Speaker 1>their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

120
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.183
<v Speaker 1>Why do people seem unable to detach </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two things because I think </v>

121
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

122
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.403
<v Speaker 1>the misinformation associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that if you criticize Islam in </v>

123
00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:54.564
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bigoted because Islam is a </v>

124
00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:57.114
<v Speaker 1>religion of Brown people and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore there are simply unable to </v>

125
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:01.904
<v Speaker 1>decouple the criticism of a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tenets from the people who may practice </v>

126
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 1>those tenets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>

127
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher sorta hit the maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger point here,</v>

128
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>which is that for people on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for liberals,</v>

129
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>we have to stand up consistently for </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal principles,</v>

130
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.074
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly what I try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stand up for women's rights and gay </v>

131
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:21.074
<v Speaker 1>rights and freedom of religion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic equality and all of those </v>

132
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:24.490
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was this weird,</v>

133
00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:25.324
<v Speaker 1>liberals have really failed and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>they fail is by invoking cultural and </v>

134
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>moral relativism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

135
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.353
<v Speaker 1>So who are we to judge that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women in some far away land there </v>

136
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Clarissa's are being cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

137
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Who are we to impose our cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>hegemony on other folks?</v>

138
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.483
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how they're able to still </v>
<v Speaker 1>be liberal and yet not criticize these </v>

139
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 1>one particular sets of beliefs by </v>
<v Speaker 1>invoking cultural relativism.</v>

140
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.583
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a real disconnect in reality </v>

141
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 1>there because in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a weird way,</v>

142
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.930
<v Speaker 1>liberals should be the most for helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>these pieces on,</v>

143
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:58.783
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because these are the principles they </v>

144
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:00.314
<v Speaker 1>believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much of this actually I really </v>

145
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:02.804
<v Speaker 1>hadn't thought until just now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess a lot of this we could sort </v>

146
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>of blame the footsteps of George W Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>for going into the wrong war.</v>

147
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:09.734
<v Speaker 1>We're now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this feeling in America like we </v>

148
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do anything ever because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>did the wrong thing.</v>

149
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Clearly interacting now it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a far worse mess than even before.</v>

150
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some of the blame is on us,</v>

151
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

152
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:22.304
<v Speaker 1>how far do you go back unfolding history</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you find the villain of your </v>

153
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.403
<v Speaker 1>choice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

154
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about the Israel Palestine</v>

155
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:33.500
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are always able to unfold history</v>

156
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 1>until the starting point that they feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy about.</v>

157
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>And then that's the point where we start</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clock,</v>

158
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:38.963
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where should we start the clock on </v>

159
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 1>that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the Islam issue in Israel.</v>

160
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Palestine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole other thing.</v>

162
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole lot of effect if we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into it if you want.</v>

163
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.143
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem there is that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to abrahamic religions that hold </v>

165
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rigid positions.</v>

166
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.360
<v Speaker 1>And as long as it's going to be les than</v>
<v Speaker 1>would religion,</v>

167
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it's never going to be resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a weird way.</v>

168
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

169
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.873
<v Speaker 1>that liberals don't want to criticize </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam because there's this idea that a </v>

170
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 1>lot of Islamic people have brown skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are plenty of Moroccan Jews.</v>

171
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Lebanese Jew,</v>

172
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.663
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

173
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 1>there are plenty of Christians that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraqi.</v>

174
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 1>There's not that many anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

175
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So even that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a weird way you could say that that's</v>

176
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 1>actually bigoted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

177
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:23.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that concept is big.</v>

178
00:08:23.431 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 1>And how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

179
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>as a dark skinned a Jew you feel about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

180
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.113
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually am able to get away with more </v>

181
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>stuff precisely because I invoke the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that I have dark skin.</v>

182
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:37.150
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I'm from the Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

183
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.113
<v Speaker 1>I use this victimology game against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warriors basically </v>

184
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:41.781
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

185
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:43.430
<v Speaker 1>be careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you criticize me?</v>

186
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Because then you'd be engaging our </v>
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>

187
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.870
<v Speaker 1>our phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fattism.</v>

188
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.103
<v Speaker 1>I actually did the privilege score and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>scored off the chart and my non </v>

189
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.003
<v Speaker 1>privilege.</v>

190
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 1>So I'm untouchable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were completely unimaginable.</v>

191
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>So the next part of this that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly interesting,</v>

192
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:01.704
<v Speaker 1>and this is really where we met because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the twitter thing that I referenced </v>

193
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.063
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there has been sort of an endless </v>

194
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 1>onslaught on Sam Harris since this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

195
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Sam is a philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a neuroscientist.</v>

196
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 1>I've read this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read some books.</v>

197
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.280
<v Speaker 1>He's not a political person per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He writes a little bit about politics,</v>

198
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:20.214
<v Speaker 1>but not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there has been this endless </v>

199
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>onslaught and I think slandering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smearing him,</v>

200
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.983
<v Speaker 1>coming from the left from people that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cases I admire partly some people </v>

201
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:29.920
<v Speaker 1>that I've worked with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about from,</v>

202
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.803
<v Speaker 1>from Glenn Greenwald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who obviously has done great stuff with </v>

203
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>the NSA and Reza Aslan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my former boss,</v>

204
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Janky younger people that are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>distorting his views.</v>

205
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:37.794
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to show a tweet that I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>last night that I think kind of sums up </v>

206
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

207
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.290
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the tweet.</v>

208
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this had nothing.</v>

209
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't tweeting about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has nothing to do with anything.</v>

210
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>And someone tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zap me questioning for Ruben report,</v>

211
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:48.474
<v Speaker 1>how exactly are we better than Isis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we knew the Middle East killing </v>

212
00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 1>millions of civilians like Sam Harris </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest.</v>

213
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.100
<v Speaker 1>And then Sam Harris later wrote back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

214
00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 1>you really believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually suggested that.</v>

215
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that tweet right there.</v>

216
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:02.244
<v Speaker 1>The reason I wanted to use it is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's a perfect example of </v>

217
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>how this discussion that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about has been so far derail.</v>

218
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Now of course Sam Harris doesn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuke them in the Middle East.</v>

219
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.653
<v Speaker 1>He had one page in his book that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly about philosophy and religion </v>

220
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.673
<v Speaker 1>where he's talking about how in the Cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>War we had a mutual assurance is </v>

221
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:21.654
<v Speaker 1>basically with Russia because you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational actors basically that wouldn't </v>

222
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:26.770
<v Speaker 1>nuke each other because then they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid they were going to get new.</v>

223
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.463
<v Speaker 1>Now this has nothing to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never said nuke the Middle East or any </v>

224
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these people keep implying it.</v>

225
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 1>They keep retweeting memes of selective </v>
<v Speaker 1>quotes.</v>

226
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.450
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these.</v>

227
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 1>These are pretty respected people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some that I know personally,</v>

228
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 1>which is why I struggle with this so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

229
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the battle of ideologies that people </v>

230
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 1>that you want to go after are not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who've got big muscles,</v>

231
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 1>but the people who have big brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are sort of totalitarian ideology.</v>

232
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Ideology is always go after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals first.</v>

233
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.823
<v Speaker 1>They want to purge them because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want anybody to counter their </v>

234
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 1>narrative and so this is exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to guys like Sam Harris.</v>

235
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 1>He has a huge following that he can't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally beheaded because we don't live</v>

236
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:05.244
<v Speaker 1>in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could certainly try my darnedest </v>

237
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.883
<v Speaker 1>to be head his reputation and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that by engaging in endless miss </v>

238
00:11:11.351 --> 00:11:12.184
<v Speaker 1>information so that people can distance </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves from him and he's just a </v>

239
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>

240
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a warmonger,</v>

241
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:17.544
<v Speaker 1>he's a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's part of a Zionist conspiracy and </v>

242
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:22.050
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you'll kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget Neocon,</v>

243
00:11:22.051 --> 00:11:22.884
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's new economy part of Halliburton </v>

244
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>and so on and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

245
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:26.364
<v Speaker 1>and the way I behead him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I silence him as by smearing </v>

246
00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:30.781
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

247
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:32.640
<v Speaker 1>So isn't that really the crazy part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

248
00:11:32.641 --> 00:11:33.510
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're saying,</v>

249
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:35.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.293
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris is in the same neo-con group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Bill Maher's and the same neo-con </v>

251
00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:41.004
<v Speaker 1>group as Dick Cheney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher has never talked about all </v>

252
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 1>the time he wants our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have 30,000</v>

253
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:47.590
<v Speaker 1>trench or something in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing there?</v>

254
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.130
<v Speaker 1>But this is literally the reverse of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>neo con.</v>

255
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these,</v>

256
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>these slurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are slanders,</v>

257
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:54.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

258
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:55.534
<v Speaker 1>I mean is that while these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these false equivalences are everywhere </v>

259
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 1>within this discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

260
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:03.910
<v Speaker 1>if you take some feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll argue that,</v>

261
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bikini is a patriarchal tool of </v>

262
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 1>oppression.</v>

263
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.453
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Burka is a liberating thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it removes the male gaze from </v>

264
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:15.184
<v Speaker 1>the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

265
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.940
<v Speaker 1>So while the Bikini clad women is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>visually raped by men,</v>

266
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:19.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you,</v>

267
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.240
<v Speaker 1>once you don the burka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is liberated.</v>

268
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Speaker 1>So these types of equivalencies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>astonishing,</v>

269
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 1>but they're everywhere right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As backwards as I may think that is,</v>

270
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

271
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:30.094
<v Speaker 1>You can believe that if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it should be up to the woman to </v>

272
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 1>decide where in most of those countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>where women are wearing burgers,</v>

273
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 1>they don't really have the choice not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear.</v>

274
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:37.864
<v Speaker 1>Of course now I'm more critical at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point and where I'm at of the left </v>

275
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:43.150
<v Speaker 1>because I'm part of the left and I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left to be better.</v>

276
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I've long given up on trying to fix the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right right here.</v>

277
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 1>That's that know I'm not going to fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tea party,</v>

278
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 1>but I can at least I think try to change</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the better.</v>

279
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.930
<v Speaker 1>The part that I'm with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why this is so disappointing.</v>

280
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.813
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of this idea that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the far left is attacking atheists </v>

281
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 1>have of all groups of people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's astonishing.</v>

282
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.113
<v Speaker 1>I mean what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess one of the reasons why they </v>

283
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:07.760
<v Speaker 1>attacked the atheist is because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be some of the most philosophers,</v>

284
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 1>a group of of people that are critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>of religion in general,</v>

285
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:13.024
<v Speaker 1>but Islam in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so to the extent that the </v>

286
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:18.490
<v Speaker 1>progressives don't like criticism of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam and to the extent that many of the</v>

287
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:21.850
<v Speaker 1>most famous atheists are quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>vociferous in their criticism of Islam,</v>

288
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:22.684
<v Speaker 1>then we have to go after them and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess this goes back to what you were </v>

289
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:25.054
<v Speaker 1>saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't seem to be able to make </v>

290
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:27.334
<v Speaker 1>the distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Bill Maher relentlessly attacked </v>

291
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody calls him a Christian of.</v>

292
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

293
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

294
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>he made a documentary where he attacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big three religions relentlessly.</v>

295
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had prompts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the processing of information is</v>

296
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:41.800
<v Speaker 1>a big cognitive bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

297
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:42.634
<v Speaker 1>So I will only pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that supports my position </v>

298
00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.620
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly what the progressives</v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing.</v>

299
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.000
<v Speaker 1>They're ignoring the endless times that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill Maher attacks other religions,</v>

300
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.030
<v Speaker 1>but they only tune in when he criticizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

301
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I would bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone can check this for us,</v>

302
00:13:57.131 --> 00:13:57.964
<v Speaker 1>but I would bet that Bill Maher has </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent far more time attacking </v>

303
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:00.784
<v Speaker 1>Christianity because he attacks things </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country far more than than </v>

304
00:14:03.781 --> 00:14:04.614
<v Speaker 1>attacking Islam or Judaism or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of how much hatred </v>

305
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.430
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be towards atheists at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment because I see all these poles</v>

306
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.413
<v Speaker 1>and on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times we've done how atheists are </v>

307
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:16.600
<v Speaker 1>the most underrepresented group in </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

308
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.433
<v Speaker 1>Barney frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was in Congress for 30 something </v>

309
00:14:19.541 --> 00:14:20.374
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was able to come out as gay in the </v>

310
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:22.803
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not as an atheist until he retired </v>

311
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.170
<v Speaker 1>from Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

312
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because atheist hold no power.</v>

313
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Have not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our people are atheist,</v>

314
00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:33.410
<v Speaker 1>killing people that I don't know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>my.</v>

315
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.363
<v Speaker 1>My feeling is that there is a coupling </v>
<v Speaker 1>of atheism and immorality in the minds </v>

316
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:41.290
<v Speaker 1>of most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so most people believe that.</v>

317
00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:43.090
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter which religion you </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow,</v>

318
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 1>as long as you are religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you somehow have a moral compass by</v>

319
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:47.914
<v Speaker 1>which you live your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By however atheists go around beheading </v>

320
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 1>and then raping them for in the minds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those folks.</v>

321
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.183
<v Speaker 1>And so an atheist is not to be trusted </v>
<v Speaker 1>because how else working he get his </v>

322
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:00.650
<v Speaker 1>morality if it's not from some Bronze </v>
<v Speaker 1>Age book.</v>

323
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.320
<v Speaker 1>So I think what you just told me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complete nonsense.</v>

324
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 1>It is complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless I mean it,</v>

325
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:06.080
<v Speaker 1>could it be anything other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

326
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:06.914
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because atheist simply aren't doing any </v>

327
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.250
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

328
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.093
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complete lunacy political </v>

329
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:11.924
<v Speaker 1>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is completely running </v>

330
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>rampant across America right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live within it as an academic,</v>

331
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 1>as an academic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to swim in it,</v>

332
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:20.160
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

333
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's start there then.</v>

334
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.240
<v Speaker 1>So to the college part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

335
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:24.950
<v Speaker 1>you know Jerry Seinfeld about a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

336
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the most apolitical comic.</v>

337
00:15:27.251 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know everything about Jerry Seinfeld.</v>

338
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any of his political </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>

339
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea if he's for abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the death penalty.</v>

340
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.453
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has any idea what he thinks he </v>
<v Speaker 1>now is saying the college campuses have </v>

341
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:40.760
<v Speaker 1>gone too politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politically correct.</v>

342
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock has backed him on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

343
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of comedians have said </v>

344
00:15:46.311 --> 00:15:49.520
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on on college campuses.</v>

345
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a powerful personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>anecdote.</v>

346
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.143
<v Speaker 1>A last year I gave a talk at Wellesley </v>
<v Speaker 1>college and all women's college about </v>

347
00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 1>the thought police and how it regulates </v>
<v Speaker 1>the free exchange of ideas.</v>

348
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.890
<v Speaker 1>After my lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a student came up to me and said,</v>

349
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.183
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of a professor at the </v>

350
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 1>start of class pulling 100 students </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how you should address them.</v>

351
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.450
<v Speaker 1>So even though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

352
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin is my student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I clearly see you as a male at the start</v>

353
00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:15.434
<v Speaker 1>of every lecture I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you do gender identify as male or </v>

354
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:19.544
<v Speaker 1>female because that will deter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I looked at her and in true </v>

355
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:22.394
<v Speaker 1>astonishment I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really see this as a viable way </v>

356
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:25.874
<v Speaker 1>by which society would be organized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where every single time we interact we </v>

357
00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:29.504
<v Speaker 1>should first preempt any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any greeting with what do you self </v>

358
00:16:33.621 --> 00:16:34.430
<v Speaker 1>identify as?</v>

359
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.360
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely,</v>

360
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:36.194
<v Speaker 1>because that way you wouldn't be hurting</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody by placing them in the wrong </v>

361
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's astonishing.</v>

362
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:42.141
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

363
00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:43.760
<v Speaker 1>So what's the most dangerous part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

364
00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Because to me it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you went ahead and did that.</v>

365
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.383
<v Speaker 1>You taught this class exactly as sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social justice warriors would want </v>

366
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:51.944
<v Speaker 1>you to teach it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the world doesn't operate like </v>

367
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:54.651
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

368
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:58.280
<v Speaker 1>So then are you actually then setting up</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids,</v>

369
00:16:58.281 --> 00:17:03.281
<v Speaker 1>these college kids for a huge awakening </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the day they graduate college,</v>

370
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.230
<v Speaker 1>but they're not well trained to face </v>
<v Speaker 1>that real world,</v>

371
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.133
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so tentative and the way they </v>

372
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.020
<v Speaker 1>express themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

373
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.390
<v Speaker 1>They're so afraid to step outside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>herd.</v>

374
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity on campuses,</v>

375
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.590
<v Speaker 1>which is very much related to what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

376
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>it's breathtaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

377
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Canadian so I don't care.</v>

378
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Republican or Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a dog in that fight,</v>

379
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.700
<v Speaker 1>but there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get this straight.</v>

380
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Jus Heron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian man,</v>

381
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:30.560
<v Speaker 1>atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheists and brown skin.</v>

382
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really do have a lot.</v>

383
00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:33.884
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

384
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:34.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there,</v>

385
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 1>there were studies that were done </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the political affiliations of</v>

386
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.480
<v Speaker 1>professors at Major American </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

387
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:46.040
<v Speaker 1>whether they're republican or Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the numbers are just astonishing and</v>

388
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:46.874
<v Speaker 1>they get worse and worse in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ratio as a function of the softness of </v>

389
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:50.784
<v Speaker 1>the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the humanities and sociology and </v>

390
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 1>gender studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something like 40 1:44</v>

391
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 1>to one ratio of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for some issues,</v>

392
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political lens doesn't matter,</v>

393
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:04.200
<v Speaker 1>but for others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

394
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 1>as the death penalty appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should be our fiscal policy?</v>

395
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.143
<v Speaker 1>Should we be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we be foreign policy </v>

396
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.310
<v Speaker 1>interventionists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

397
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:12.144
<v Speaker 1>your political lens effects these </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions and to have all academia </v>

398
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:22.050
<v Speaker 1>being represented by one side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political spectrum as horrifying.</v>

399
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

400
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:28.790
<v Speaker 1>even though I may in most cases agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that end of academia,</v>

401
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 1>not certainly not the political correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

402
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 1>but I might agree with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophically on a lot of the points.</v>

403
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.640
<v Speaker 1>How do you balance that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Thomas Solo,</v>

404
00:18:36.641 --> 00:18:39.380
<v Speaker 1>who's a very famous conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists,</v>

405
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.060
<v Speaker 1>a set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to botch the exact quote,</v>

406
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.230
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a intellectual diversity is diversity on</v>

407
00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:49.380
<v Speaker 1>campuses as great as long as it's sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation,</v>

408
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.390
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic diversity,</v>

409
00:18:51.391 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 1>racial diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the one diversity that should really</v>

410
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:55.950
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual diversity,</v>

411
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.440
<v Speaker 1>we condemn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

412
00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 1>what we need to do is just a thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is thought exactly.</v>

413
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.193
<v Speaker 1>And what we need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was to find ways to create greater </v>

414
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:07.320
<v Speaker 1>diversity on campus is to allow both </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides of any position to speak.</v>

415
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:08.963
<v Speaker 1>Do you think a lot of this has to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the way our culture has changed in </v>

416
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of years?</v>

417
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Like where are you can't bully a kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

418
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:15.474
<v Speaker 1>I'm not for bullying of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that this concept where we keep </v>

419
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.720
<v Speaker 1>making everything that no one can ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>be offended by anything else.</v>

420
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:23.581
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

421
00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 1>they took after the confederate flag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the shooting in Charleston.</v>

422
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Now they took dukes of hazzard off </v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

423
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys were not,</v>

424
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.930
<v Speaker 1>they were not somehow southern white </v>
<v Speaker 1>supremacists.</v>

425
00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:34.750
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

426
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.480
<v Speaker 1>they took that off television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

427
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to defend cosby who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my comedy heroes growing up,</v>

428
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.940
<v Speaker 1>but they took the cosby show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

429
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.110
<v Speaker 1>we're starting to censor ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in a way that's going to lead to</v>

430
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:46.944
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

431
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 1>every time I watched Seinfeld now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every episode,</v>

432
00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:50.154
<v Speaker 1>I think in 10 years they're gonna say </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was racist and massage every </v>

433
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.083
<v Speaker 1>literally every single episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salon did a piece a couple of weeks ago </v>

434
00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:57.220
<v Speaker 1>about trouble.</v>

435
00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Some episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes of Seinfeld.</v>

436
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.750
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do to combat that?</v>

437
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive's pray at the altar.</v>

438
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.960
<v Speaker 1>They self flagellate at the altar of non</v>
<v Speaker 1>offense.</v>

439
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's their,</v>

440
00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.700
<v Speaker 1>their motto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

441
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.880
<v Speaker 1>we need to find a way to break through </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thought.</v>

442
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

443
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.163
<v Speaker 1>Give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I used to be a very competitive </v>

444
00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:17.460
<v Speaker 1>soccer player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to today,</v>

445
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 1>look at the trash talking that went on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the soccer fields between players,</v>

446
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then everybody would be arrested today.</v>

447
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would be sent to a hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

448
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:28.321
<v Speaker 1>Try again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

449
00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:29.154
<v Speaker 1>Because you mean because of racist stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and homophobic on everything under the </v>

450
00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:32.314
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

451
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.443
<v Speaker 1>guess what I heard camel jockey grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up playing soccer and I lived </v>

452
00:20:37.011 --> 00:20:38.310
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to love again,</v>

453
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's called life grow a pair.</v>

454
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do we,</v>

455
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.440
<v Speaker 1>what do we do about that because that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like what do we do to grow a pair</v>

456
00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:49.900
<v Speaker 1>for the country or for Canada or.</v>

457
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are many different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

458
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture of narcissism is,</v>

459
00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not helping the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The culture of entitlement,</v>

460
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should get an a plus.</v>

461
00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should get their medal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should get a trophy.</v>

462
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's several different movements that</v>

463
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:07.270
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>

464
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.133
<v Speaker 1>pussified the west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be happy with you </v>

465
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:11.670
<v Speaker 1>for that if that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring.</v>

466
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:12.923
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk a little bit about some of </v>

467
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

468
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 1>some of the machinations I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

469
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 1>of things that are going on on college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger warnings and some of these other</v>

470
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.001
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were sort of,</v>

471
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:23.500
<v Speaker 1>you sort of talked about this a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit earlier.</v>

472
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Safe spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe spaces,</v>

473
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:26.883
<v Speaker 1>safe spaces is a place where I can go so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm protected from things that </v>

474
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:33.130
<v Speaker 1>might make me go into a fetal position </v>
<v Speaker 1>and suck my thumb.</v>

475
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.930
<v Speaker 1>So give me one for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

476
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.160
<v Speaker 1>why would you go to a site?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would someone in college go to it?</v>

477
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.583
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's going to be a speaker </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to talk something about pro </v>

478
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:43.774
<v Speaker 1>Israel and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be a student who is very much </v>

479
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:47.404
<v Speaker 1>against Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that makes me feel very </v>

480
00:21:48.821 --> 00:21:53.821
<v Speaker 1>threatened at University of Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to simply show,</v>

481
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.540
<v Speaker 1>was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it called sniper?</v>

482
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:57.390
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie American sniper.</v>

483
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.633
<v Speaker 1>And that made a lot of the students feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unsafe simply because that movie </v>

484
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 1>was going to be shown on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's astonishing.</v>

485
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

486
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher was being asked to give the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commencement speech at Berkeley,</v>

487
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the bastion,</v>

488
00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:14.773
<v Speaker 1>the home of free speech in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of the kids there didn't want </v>

489
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.710
<v Speaker 1>him to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ended up doing it,</v>

490
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.880
<v Speaker 1>but he had a guest.</v>

491
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.713
<v Speaker 1>I forget her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually in the audience that </v>

492
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.873
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a guest who said that he </v>

493
00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:29.470
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do it because he's against </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>

494
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's on her.</v>

495
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 1>She's on his show using her right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>

496
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.750
<v Speaker 1>So there's like a a cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>disconnect.</v>

497
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:38.584
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an article where I have </v>

498
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Huffington post where I talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger warnings and I listed all of the</v>

499
00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:45.844
<v Speaker 1>different concepts that necessitate </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger warnings pretty much everything </v>

500
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:51.130
<v Speaker 1>under the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

501
00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 1>literally life requires a trigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning.</v>

502
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Is this why everyone's medicated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much,</v>

503
00:22:57.221 --> 00:22:58.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're onto something.</v>

504
00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.293
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think there is a connection </v>

505
00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:00.611
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

506
00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:03.040
<v Speaker 1>if you do all this stuff right and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>give every year,</v>

507
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:05.050
<v Speaker 1>everyone is the trigger warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give them safe spaces.</v>

508
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:07.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't let them hear from contrarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>views and all this stuff.</v>

509
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Then you throw them out in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>where none of this stuff is real because</v>

510
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:11.523
<v Speaker 1>you get out to the world and it's pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty and you're know you're going to </v>

511
00:23:13.421 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 1>have a boss that might be sexist or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor that might be homophobic.</v>

512
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.553
<v Speaker 1>That is why then everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medicaid's because then they're not </v>

513
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.140
<v Speaker 1>given the tools to deal in reality life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

514
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.630
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behavioral Sciences.</v>

515
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.870
<v Speaker 1>That's rather nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pop Psychology.</v>

516
00:23:26.871 --> 00:23:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was pretty good.</v>

517
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the Internet is helping or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting?</v>

518
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.681
<v Speaker 1>A bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

519
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:33.514
<v Speaker 1>I think to the extent that the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>serves as a vehicle for meme </v>

520
00:23:37.091 --> 00:23:39.610
<v Speaker 1>propagation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can get their message out,</v>

521
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.860
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they might have difficulty </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so.</v>

522
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.380
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that some of the ones who</v>

523
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:46.214
<v Speaker 1>hurled the greatest amount of venom are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who really are against the </v>

524
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:50.290
<v Speaker 1>free exchange of ideas.</v>

525
00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 1>So the social justice warriors that come</v>
<v Speaker 1>after guys.</v>

526
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.713
<v Speaker 1>Luckily I've actually been free of most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these guys maybe because I'm quite </v>

527
00:23:56.991 --> 00:23:58.490
<v Speaker 1>reserved than my positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

528
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

529
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.150
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but make sure they come after yesterday.</v>

530
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll send some of my people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that on average a bit of both</v>

531
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.290
<v Speaker 1>good in that you allow people to express</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves bad and that there's one camp</v>

532
00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:15.800
<v Speaker 1>of folks that is a lot more vested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>shutting down free exchange.</v>

533
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.663
<v Speaker 1>So is that the challenge then of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist community or the secular </v>

534
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 1>community or the rational community is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't yell as loud,</v>

535
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.433
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we then line up in a way </v>

536
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Speaker 1>versus versus the trolls versus the </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry mob?</v>

537
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.770
<v Speaker 1>How do you get sane people to band </v>
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>

538
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the very least,</v>

539
00:24:34.881 --> 00:24:35.714
<v Speaker 1>and I often a admonish my academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues for this who don't </v>

540
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:41.630
<v Speaker 1>participate in this and this great </v>
<v Speaker 1>public discourse,</v>

541
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

542
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.960
<v Speaker 1>They're very interested in doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very narrow research,</v>

543
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.500
<v Speaker 1>but yet they are shy away from talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about these bigger issues.</v>

544
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Even though their professors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

545
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.920
<v Speaker 1>you're all about meme propagation if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a professor.</v>

546
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.013
<v Speaker 1>And so what I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least what I do at my limited sphere </v>

547
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:56.324
<v Speaker 1>of influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to try to get my colleagues to weigh </v>

548
00:24:58.341 --> 00:24:59.174
<v Speaker 1>in on these issues so that we could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>academics weighing in and not just the </v>

549
00:25:02.361 --> 00:25:04.710
<v Speaker 1>trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that work very well?</v>

550
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been very successful because </v>
<v Speaker 1>most are terrified of their shadows.</v>

551
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that say then?</v>

552
00:25:10.851 --> 00:25:14.010
<v Speaker 1>That it's not just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's coming from every angle,</v>

553
00:25:14.011 --> 00:25:14.844
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming from politicians and it's </v>

554
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:19.840
<v Speaker 1>coming from the media people and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from the professors,</v>

555
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:20.683
<v Speaker 1>not just what I would add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would add cowardice as part of the </v>

556
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:23.960
<v Speaker 1>seven deadly sins.</v>

557
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.240
<v Speaker 1>I would make it a deadly sins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice.</v>

558
00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.910
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm astonished at how cowardly,</v>

559
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:29.933
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are there and I even get </v>

560
00:25:31.851 --> 00:25:33.410
<v Speaker 1>people who come to me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

561
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:33.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

562
00:25:33.811 --> 00:25:35.090
<v Speaker 1>you do great science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

563
00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a non scientist.</v>

564
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Why do you weigh in on these issues?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I can't help it because it's,</v>

565
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I feel that it's my job to weigh in on </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that are nonsensical.</v>

566
00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Like the ones we discussed earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of my job description.</v>

567
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

568
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I think when I'm,</v>

569
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:50.743
<v Speaker 1>when I'm tweeting about this stuff or </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm writing about or whatever it </v>

570
00:25:52.641 --> 00:25:53.474
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I wish I didn't have the right </v>

571
00:25:55.451 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Speaker 1>to talk about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

572
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 1>in a weird way because it's so obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

573
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

574
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.790
<v Speaker 1>that the atheist and the seculars that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

575
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.720
<v Speaker 1>we're on the right side of letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
