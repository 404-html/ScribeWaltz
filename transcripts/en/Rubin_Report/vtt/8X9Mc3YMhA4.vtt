1
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.903
<v Speaker 1>We're continuing our partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn liberty this week and joining me </v>

2
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>today as a senior fellow at the Mercatus</v>
<v Speaker 1>Center at George Mason University,</v>

3
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>as well as a professor of economics at </v>
<v Speaker 1>George Mason.</v>

4
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Don Boudreaux,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Happy to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am glad you are here.</v>

6
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I saw you speak about a year ago in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dallas.</v>

7
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I want to get the exact title of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech right.</v>

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was called,</v>

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>can we bring sound economic thinking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington?</v>

10
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a year ago and uh,</v>

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.493
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's much sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic thinking or sound thinking and </v>

12
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget economics for a second.</v>

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>These things don't seem to go together </v>
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>

14
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington seems to repel something.</v>

15
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>It attracts unsound thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it was always that way,</v>

17
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>or are we in unique times?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

18
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>We're definitely a unique talent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique time.</v>

19
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.943
<v Speaker 1>So I was born in 1958,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I came of age right when Ronald </v>

20
00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.603
<v Speaker 1>Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at the end of the Carter </v>

21
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when even Carter's pushing for direct,</v>

22
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.523
<v Speaker 1>at least accepting deregulation taxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>were being cut airline to being </v>

23
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>deregulated surface transportation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being deregulated.</v>

24
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Reagan gets elected in 1980.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman has this popular show on</v>

25
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:19.041
<v Speaker 1>pbs called free to choose a Thomas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned about Thomas Soul.</v>

26
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Everything seems great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was,</v>

27
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Speaker 1>this world is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

28
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.293
<v Speaker 1>so in my life in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a period in the past when the </v>

29
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>thinking was more sound quibble with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but compared to today it was,</v>

30
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>it was outstanding because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely,</v>

31
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely declined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

32
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.843
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to imagine even that around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time of Jimmy Carter that </v>

33
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>deregulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

34
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>that Democrats could have had anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with that.</v>

35
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>And yet the Ted Kennedy was a major </v>
<v Speaker 1>force behind airline deregulation.</v>

36
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was something,</v>

37
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what it was exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something in the air,</v>

38
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting in the late seventies.</v>

39
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>I was a young man then I just took it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for granted,</v>

41
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.901
<v Speaker 1>this is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>we were winning and then it culminates </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1989 with the collapse of the,</v>

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Iron Curtain in 1991,</v>

44
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of the Soviet Union.</v>

45
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And then here we are 2018 and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense is back on the front burner.</v>

46
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.403
<v Speaker 1>Nonsense is back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's jump back though to the </v>

47
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>seventies for a second because I watched</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interview with you this morning.</v>

48
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Something happened to you I believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1977 that,</v>

49
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.783
<v Speaker 1>that woke you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it sort of is a nice entry </v>

50
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:32.830
<v Speaker 1>into everything else that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.541
<v Speaker 1>I know what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I said is most important to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to you in 1977?</v>

53
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>You can come up with a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>

54
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The date was,</v>

55
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was January 24th,</v>

56
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>1977.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was a um,</v>

57
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in college.</v>

58
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I went to police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother,</v>

59
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.690
<v Speaker 1>my plan was to drink beer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chase girls.</v>

60
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of the former,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't successful with the ladder,</v>

61
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.583
<v Speaker 1>but I was then I was going to drop out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of college and work at the shipyard </v>

62
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.343
<v Speaker 1>where my parents worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I needed a class to fit my schedule </v>

63
00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>and needed the Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday,</v>

64
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Friday class.</v>

65
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>So take this class called economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know what it was,</v>

66
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.363
<v Speaker 1>took it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great teacher and so she drew </v>

67
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>supply and demand curves on the board </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she said,</v>

68
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:12.814
<v Speaker 1>look what happens when the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevents the price of something from </v>

69
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>rising to its market level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it creates a shortage.</v>

70
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.753
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember the gasoline shortages of </v>

71
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.300
<v Speaker 1>1973.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

72
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.523
<v Speaker 1>I was in those and I just thought the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty of this economic explanation for </v>

73
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>the gasoline shortage was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular.</v>

74
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to learn more about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

75
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>And so in very short order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fell in love with economics.</v>

76
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm still in love with it to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>So tell me what happened after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you have your spar and what,</v>

78
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.843
<v Speaker 1>what sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what academic procedures did you have </v>

79
00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>that got you to where you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was very lucky.</v>

80
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.533
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a really good teacher and it </v>

81
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a famous economist at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a very good teacher.</v>

82
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>She took a great interest in her </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

83
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.493
<v Speaker 1>She taught economics as if it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something relevant to the real world </v>

84
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:58.550
<v Speaker 1>rather than just a mathematical puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

85
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>and there was another guy at my I went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to puts called Nicholls State University</v>

86
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 1>and Tibideau Louisiana and it says it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very small school,</v>

87
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>but I had another professor there who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was into Milton Friedman into high Eq,</v>

88
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>into Ludwig von mises into James </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buchanan,</v>

89
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>who later became my colleague at George </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mason.</v>

90
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:18.490
<v Speaker 1>So I would go to his office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name is bill field,</v>

91
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.893
<v Speaker 1>and he would give me these books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I remember just really just </v>

92
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>tearing through these books and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>made so much sense to me.</v>

93
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I realized in reading these books that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all my life,</v>

94
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't give much thought to politics.</v>

95
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Not much conscious thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all my life,</v>

96
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.023
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think somewhere deep inside of me was </v>

97
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.634
<v Speaker 1>a classical liberal or libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who believed that is basically </v>

98
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>impolite to button to other people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

99
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

100
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.180
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

101
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

102
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 1>and not only impolite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

103
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 1>it's downright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's downright offensive to do so.</v>

104
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just said to him,</v>

105
00:04:51.561 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>my buzz phrases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so classical,</v>

106
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 1>liberal and Libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

107
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>one of the questions I get most because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I define,</v>

108
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I say that I am a classical liberal if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>

109
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>if I need a label on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I am.</v>

110
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>And people will always say to me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about many of the things that you</v>

111
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>teach about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about free markets and all that stuff,</v>

112
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that freedom is the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>way for humans to flourish.</v>

113
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.641
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

114
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>you're really a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just holding onto this definition</v>

115
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>of liberalism from 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

116
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you see a meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you define each one and do you</v>

117
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>see a meaningful distinction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see much of a distinction.</v>

118
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Depends on who you talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people see,</v>

119
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.020
<v Speaker 1>see distinctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what they both have in common,</v>

120
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.883
<v Speaker 1>maybe distinctions that the margin </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarians maybe tend to be a little </v>

121
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>bit more radical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

123
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

124
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:36.783
<v Speaker 1>what distinguishes classical liberals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Libertarians as broadly from almost </v>

125
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:42.900
<v Speaker 1>any other political group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

126
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 1>is the consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

127
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.763
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that any exercise of power by </v>

128
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>the state must meet a huge burden of </v>
<v Speaker 1>proof.</v>

129
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.203
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

130
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.771
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

131
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:54.604
<v Speaker 1>the burden of proof is not upon the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual to make the case his or her </v>

132
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's upon the state to make the case,</v>

133
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>to Intro to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to override that freedom.</v>

134
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>And I believe in libertarian or </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical liberals as I think of them,</v>

135
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>believed that that burden is a real one </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a heavy one.</v>

136
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it can be met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but too often the reverse is in place.</v>

137
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>People believe that you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the burden is on those of us who,</v>

138
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 1>who defend freedom to make the case for </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

139
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.013
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically you view it as sort of a </v>

140
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:26.624
<v Speaker 1>bottom up way of looking at things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the individual first and the </v>

141
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 1>government is not giving you your </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

142
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>It can take it away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

143
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:36.700
<v Speaker 1>by instituting all sorts of policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

144
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in this case,</v>

145
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:38.864
<v Speaker 1>I am A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think John Locke was right in John </v>

146
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.253
<v Speaker 1>Locke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the only person he put John Lott </v>

147
00:06:42.851 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 1>most famously in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made the argument in this,</v>

148
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 1>in the secondary of some government </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

149
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have rights and human </v>

151
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:56.290
<v Speaker 1>beings delegate to the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

152
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.650
<v Speaker 1>powers that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

153
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.543
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who do the delegation believe are </v>

154
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 1>appropriate for the government to defend</v>
<v Speaker 1>those rights.</v>

155
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can quibble about how historically </v>

156
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:10.000
<v Speaker 1>accurate that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like,</v>

157
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that perspective is </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophically correct.</v>

158
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.083
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no government gives me or you rights </v>

159
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 1>governments are excellent at offending </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and taking them away.</v>

160
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

161
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.163
<v Speaker 1>but just because government is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect your rights doesn't mean he </v>

162
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.613
<v Speaker 1>gives us rights just because farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we couldn't live without </v>

163
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 1>farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if no one grew food and,</v>

164
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and did ranching,</v>

165
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:36.074
<v Speaker 1>we would all starve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that we owe our lives </v>

166
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>to farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

167
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the great things about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>society that we live in is that it's a,</v>

168
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.033
<v Speaker 1>it was called the great society to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguished from when the Johnson's </v>

169
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 1>great society and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a society of many,</v>

170
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:53.330
<v Speaker 1>many individuals each specialized in </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing various things.</v>

171
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 1>We're all coordinated by the price </v>
<v Speaker 1>system in,</v>

172
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>by the rule of law.</v>

173
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:57.683
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so each of us makes a contribution </v>

174
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:03.881
<v Speaker 1>to the welfare of others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one of us is utterly essential.</v>

175
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

176
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to talk more about hiking a </v>

177
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:12.680
<v Speaker 1>little bit because you do run the cafe </v>
<v Speaker 1>high Eq blog.</v>

178
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:13.763
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned the burden of proof that </v>

179
00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:15.734
<v Speaker 1>the government has to meet to say when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right to actually infringe on some </v>

180
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 1>of your rights or basically do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.163
<v Speaker 1>So this is where I would say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical liberal and Libertarian </v>

182
00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>positions that are a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

183
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:28.244
<v Speaker 1>I see some utility for the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'd usually want it done at </v>

184
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:31.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the state level,</v>

185
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:32.804
<v Speaker 1>not the federal level and libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of hard to pin on when it's </v>

186
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you alluded to that when you talk to</v>

187
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:40.580
<v Speaker 1>libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get to a place where,</v>

188
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 1>where it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:43.094
<v Speaker 1>I always make the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like eventually you'll just be in </v>

190
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 1>mad max or the true anarcho capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I enjoy talking to,</v>

191
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>but I view it as more of an intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise than a practical.</v>

192
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

193
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:54.243
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sympathetic anarcho and </v>

194
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>philosophically I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

195
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a,</v>

196
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

197
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>a blow things up kind of guy and I'm way</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much of a hierarchy.</v>

198
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And to understand that you just can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>replace social institutions.</v>

199
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Wholesale Society has to evolve to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it's going to be from March,</v>

200
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>from being a realist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

201
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.540
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't blow it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

202
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

203
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:15.984
<v Speaker 1>yes you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But history has a lot of really telling </v>

204
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:19.734
<v Speaker 1>examples about attempts to blow up </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies wholesale in those examples </v>

205
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:25.910
<v Speaker 1>have never turned out well in practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

206
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 1>let me say among the people who will </v>
<v Speaker 1>call themselves classical liberals,</v>

207
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of them are ever at a w,</v>

208
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:35.763
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>express any sympathy for animal </v>

209
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 1>capitalism among Libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them will say,</v>

210
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:40.734
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

211
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's a role for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

212
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 1>but you do it.</v>

213
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 1>People who classify themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians who say,</v>

214
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

215
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.173
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the society could exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>without any formal institution have </v>

216
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.570
<v Speaker 1>monopolized coercion and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am in that latter latter.</v>

217
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be the one classical liberal who</v>

218
00:09:58.771 --> 00:09:59.710
<v Speaker 1>will do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe that.</v>

219
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Maybe by that definition I'm a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>more libertarian,</v>

220
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

221
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

222
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.373
<v Speaker 1>it's really sort of the narcissism of </v>
<v Speaker 1>small differences in exactly in this </v>

224
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 1>little place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

225
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:11.270
<v Speaker 1>so what are some of the basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles?</v>

226
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.203
<v Speaker 1>You're a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the basic principles that </v>

227
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 1>people should know about economics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm giving you a wide one there,</v>

228
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 1>but for someone watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's waiting for their 19,</v>

229
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>77 moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in no particular order,</v>

230
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

231
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 1>scarcity is unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a world of scarce resources,</v>

232
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 1>which means that if you use some </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources to do this good thing,</v>

233
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 1>you take resources away from the ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do other good things.</v>

234
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.823
<v Speaker 1>They both good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to choose do we want to do </v>

235
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 1>this good thing or do we want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

236
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:41.784
<v Speaker 1>Good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second thing to note in order to make </v>

237
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:45.160
<v Speaker 1>that decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

238
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 1>we want the people involved who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be affected both by the loss of</v>

239
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 1>that which is not done and by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit of that which is done to express</v>

240
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:55.450
<v Speaker 1>their opinions honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

241
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.333
<v Speaker 1>how valuable is this thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>propose to do and how valuable is this </v>

242
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>thing that we propose to give up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to do this first thing?</v>

243
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to do that,</v>

244
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.251
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

245
00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:06.084
<v Speaker 1>you need people on the ground who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually affected by these decisions to </v>

246
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meaningful say.</v>

247
00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't want a third party looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>down making declarations.</v>

248
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should have that.</v>

249
00:11:16.171 --> 00:11:18.240
<v Speaker 1>And I think you should not have had </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

250
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.073
<v Speaker 1>So any social mechanism that gives each </v>
<v Speaker 1>of us as much of a say as possible in </v>

251
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.210
<v Speaker 1>how we use resources and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

252
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.060
<v Speaker 1>and make the evaluations about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

253
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.330
<v Speaker 1>what will happen if we use resources in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this way and what will give up if we use</v>

254
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 1>resources in this way that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

255
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Unintended consequences is another </v>
<v Speaker 1>important concept.</v>

256
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.271
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

257
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:46.104
<v Speaker 1>Adam Smith in the wealth of nations </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is rightly considered to be the </v>

258
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.620
<v Speaker 1>start starting point of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific economics.</v>

259
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:53.763
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he famously talked about the invisible </v>

260
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:56.104
<v Speaker 1>hand and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this the sort of an unintended </v>

261
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:02.260
<v Speaker 1>consequences kind of explanations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not from the benevolence of the butcher,</v>

262
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 1>the brewer there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baker that we expect our dinner,</v>

263
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:05.970
<v Speaker 1>but from their regard to their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests,</v>

264
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.150
<v Speaker 1>they don't dislike you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They value as a customer,</v>

265
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 1>but they are doing their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not primarily to help you.</v>

266
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.460
<v Speaker 1>They're doing their jobs to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and you are buying from them,</v>

267
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:19.294
<v Speaker 1>not primarily to help them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but primarily to help you and your </v>

268
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:22.240
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that way,</v>

269
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.313
<v Speaker 1>everyone's either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a good unintended </v>

270
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 1>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have,</v>

271
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 1>you have bad unintended consequences as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as one of my favorite examples of a</v>

272
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>bad unintended consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The minimum wage raise the minimum wage.</v>

273
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 1>It looks like you helping low skill </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers if you might help some of them,</v>

274
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:37.144
<v Speaker 1>but in fact you putting other low </v>
<v Speaker 1>skilled workers out of jobs and you're </v>

275
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 1>keeping them out of the job market for </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

276
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.490
<v Speaker 1>And so economists think what makes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good economist,</v>

277
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.623
<v Speaker 1>which distinguishes a good economist </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a bad economist or non economist </v>

278
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.623
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a consistency and asking questions </v>

279
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 1>always asking as compared to what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As compared to what,</v>

280
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 1>where did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to pay for that?</v>

281
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.370
<v Speaker 1>What did this cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

282
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will be the longterm consequences </v>

283
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 1>down the road beyond the immediate ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

284
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.070
<v Speaker 1>that everyone can see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a,</v>

285
00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:10.330
<v Speaker 1>it's just a consistency and asking those</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

286
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:10.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

287
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 1>as you're answering the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps making me think,</v>

288
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:15.424
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shows you why politics is so </v>

289
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:17.614
<v Speaker 1>screwed up because they get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all politicians on either side </v>

290
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:23.290
<v Speaker 1>and they either say $15 minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie or trump,</v>

291
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to cut taxes on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they,</v>

292
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they loved their bumper sticker stuff,</v>

293
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's ever said unintended </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences in a presidential debate.</v>

294
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 1>So how frustrating less that be as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>economist,</v>

295
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.193
<v Speaker 1>listening to people who are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists who really aren't experts in </v>

296
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:39.094
<v Speaker 1>much of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that Bernie has ever </v>

297
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:40.774
<v Speaker 1>created a business or made anyone make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar off and I'm not aware of it </v>

298
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.483
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>

299
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.463
<v Speaker 1>But that must be incredibly frustrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear non pros talk about the things </v>

300
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 1>that you're a pro at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is Dave and you know,</v>

301
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:56.620
<v Speaker 1>it's especially frustrating about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not rocket science.</v>

302
00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love economics.</v>

303
00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:00.454
<v Speaker 1>I love my profession and I really admire</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best among my professional </v>

304
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 1>colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman and high Eq.</v>

305
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.983
<v Speaker 1>But it's not rocket science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this consistency of always </v>

306
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:16.120
<v Speaker 1>understanding that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences beyond the immediate,</v>

307
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

308
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>that there's always a cost to something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

309
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.410
<v Speaker 1>that no matter how beneficial something </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

310
00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:26.800
<v Speaker 1>it has to be weighed against that cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these simple,</v>

311
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.673
<v Speaker 1>a simple understanding and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistency and applying that </v>

312
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:33.550
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not difficult,</v>

313
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 1>but so few people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is,</v>

314
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.830
<v Speaker 1>it is frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

315
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Years ago I stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

316
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I joke that I stopped watching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evening.</v>

317
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.720
<v Speaker 1>People my age used to watch the evening </v>
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>

318
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

319
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some recollection,</v>

320
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.110
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop watching the news.</v>

321
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I was always threatened to throw my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes through the,</v>

322
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 1>through the screen because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporters,</v>

323
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.820
<v Speaker 1>they would very much like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

324
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 1>they would report on the immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

325
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage is going to rise.</v>

326
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.360
<v Speaker 1>That that means that workers will get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise of whatever the amount is as well.</v>

327
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 1>What it does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that for some workers,</v>

328
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 1>but it means also other workers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna lose their jobs.</v>

329
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.523
<v Speaker 1>Some jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of those jobs are going to </v>

330
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:14.624
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Employers aren't just going to sit back </v>

331
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:16.371
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

332
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:17.810
<v Speaker 1>well we've got to pay higher minimum </v>
<v Speaker 1>wages,</v>

333
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 1>so let's just be higher minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's that money coming from?</v>

334
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Where are those resources coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to come from somewhere.</v>

335
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically your argument would be that</v>

336
00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:25.904
<v Speaker 1>the government's only role in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy is to make sure we're not </v>

337
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 1>killing each other pretty much.</v>

338
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.183
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it really it's a total laissez </v>

339
00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 1>faire at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

340
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:35.443
<v Speaker 1>I am a very laissez faire guy if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if property rights are well defined and </v>

341
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:40.184
<v Speaker 1>secure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a strong case of government </v>

342
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:43.723
<v Speaker 1>plays a role of Ken play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a role in helping to define and </v>

343
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.570
<v Speaker 1>certainly helping to secure property </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

344
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.453
<v Speaker 1>So that's where your contract rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where you're not in Oracle </v>

345
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.650
<v Speaker 1>capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

346
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:54.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

347
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm close to being right.</v>

348
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:56.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

349
00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing.</v>

350
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to admit that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gradually giving that to Devon.</v>

351
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to admit that anarcho </v>

352
00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:06.500
<v Speaker 1>capitalism might not be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

353
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately a defensible position.</v>

354
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I am not willing to admit that free </v>
<v Speaker 1>markets are an indefensible position.</v>

355
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.750
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>property rights come to be.</v>

356
00:16:17.751 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are defined,</v>

357
00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:20.234
<v Speaker 1>however they are enforced when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>secure private property rights and </v>

358
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.113
<v Speaker 1>freedom of contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which includes importantly the freedom </v>

359
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.873
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

360
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I have the freedom to not contract.</v>

361
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:32.703
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people are led to pursue their </v>

362
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.430
<v Speaker 1>people in pursuing their own interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are obliged to help others out.</v>

363
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's how this great society that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in and it is great,</v>

364
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.283
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to grow and become more </v>

365
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:48.410
<v Speaker 1>prosperous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

366
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 1>So I mentioned to you right before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started that,</v>

367
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.943
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a political awakening of sorts </v>

368
00:16:53.301 --> 00:16:55.130
<v Speaker 1>and I always say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really move,</v>

369
00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:55.964
<v Speaker 1>but the left went so bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up being friends with all these </v>

370
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians and conservatives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

371
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.750
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even for the differences we may have,</v>

372
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:03.584
<v Speaker 1>but one place I have shifted is that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>am much more aware you are economically </v>

373
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:08.084
<v Speaker 1>now and partly that's because I now run </v>
<v Speaker 1>my own business and have employees and </v>

374
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:12.854
<v Speaker 1>have to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just wrote to obscene lehigh </v>

375
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:17.540
<v Speaker 1>checks for taxes for the year.</v>

376
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are in California.</v>

377
00:17:18.711 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to know him like that one</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in the federal loans even worse,</v>

378
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you're more successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the harder I work,</v>

379
00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:25.604
<v Speaker 1>the more they want to take from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tweeted something about that on </v>

380
00:17:28.161 --> 00:17:30.530
<v Speaker 1>tax day and a lot of people were angry </v>
<v Speaker 1>at me and said,</v>

381
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.663
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

382
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the price to pay for success.</v>

383
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather be poor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't want to go on a major tweet</v>

384
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:39.580
<v Speaker 1>storm and you wisely or not on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but could you,</v>

385
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.290
<v Speaker 1>could you give me something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I ever get in that fight again,</v>

386
00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I can say to people why that's not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right way to think.</v>

387
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.940
<v Speaker 1>So let me start off with just asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

388
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard the story about George </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcgovern when he retired from politics?</v>

389
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.670
<v Speaker 1>He a big sale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please say,</v>

390
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 1>so George Mcgovern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he retired from politics.</v>

391
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I think I have the details right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He certainly had the major part of it.</v>

392
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.630
<v Speaker 1>He started the BNB,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

393
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

394
00:18:02.151 --> 00:18:03.470
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his home state already.</v>

395
00:18:03.471 --> 00:18:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Like where this is going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

396
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.113
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

397
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 1>then he encounters all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations,</v>

398
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor regulations,</v>

399
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:12.240
<v Speaker 1>safety regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

400
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 1>and he admits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember now to whom he admitted</v>

401
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:16.400
<v Speaker 1>as a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

402
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.101
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he admits,</v>

403
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:17.431
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

404
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I've spent all my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quoting him,</v>

405
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going from memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I spent all my life pushing for these</v>

406
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:23.574
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sufficiently attentive to the </v>

407
00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:28.550
<v Speaker 1>downside of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

408
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.380
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these taxes and these regulations.</v>

409
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.590
<v Speaker 1>And so it's easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 1>to sit in Sacramento to sit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington dc to sit in some,</v>

411
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local government,</v>

412
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.000
<v Speaker 1>a office building and tell other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to live and to tell other people how</v>

413
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 1>much money they have to give to you.</v>

414
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.010
<v Speaker 1>And you can be well intentioned in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best sense of the term,</v>

415
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.473
<v Speaker 1>but you are not those other people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those other people are bearing </v>

416
00:18:54.061 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 1>consequences and they know of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't understand.</v>

417
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

418
00:18:58.411 --> 00:18:59.180
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

419
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.400
<v Speaker 1>on the tax thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like what,</v>

420
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Ed Crane said about,</v>

421
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.213
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the famous quotation that is above the </v>

422
00:19:08.431 --> 00:19:13.431
<v Speaker 1>door of the IRS building in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a quotation from justice Oliver,</v>

423
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Wendell Holmes who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this exact quotation,</v>

424
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.570
<v Speaker 1>taxation is the price you pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

425
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:19.980
<v Speaker 1>And Crane says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

426
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.083
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taxation is the price we pay for being </v>

427
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.570
<v Speaker 1>insufficiently civil law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Civilization is,</v>

428
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.050
<v Speaker 1>is when we cooperate peacefully to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

429
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.383
<v Speaker 1>And so even if we grant that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>some role for government and once you </v>

430
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:34.974
<v Speaker 1>granted some role for government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to not see that </v>

431
00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:38.454
<v Speaker 1>there's some appropriate level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxation to fund that role for </v>

432
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.230
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

433
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much that may be true that we need,</v>

434
00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:50.160
<v Speaker 1>that it represents a failure of us as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>society to become fully civilized.</v>

435
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:50.994
<v Speaker 1>We've somehow not managed to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to cooperate peacefully and </v>

436
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:54.774
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily in those matters in ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have managed to discover how to </v>

437
00:19:58.951 --> 00:19:59.784
<v Speaker 1>cooperate peacefully and voluntarily and</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what we're doing here today and </v>

438
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:02.634
<v Speaker 1>going to the supermarket and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermarket dealing with the various </v>

439
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 1>suppliers that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it has.</v>

440
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.740
<v Speaker 1>None of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is funded with taxation,</v>

441
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.630
<v Speaker 1>so all funded with voluntary voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>payments.</v>

442
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.613
<v Speaker 1>That is civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I liked the notion that the taxation </v>

443
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.460
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

444
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.373
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a measure of how little we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are civilized or how far we have to go </v>

445
00:20:22.551 --> 00:20:25.390
<v Speaker 1>to be completely civilized to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not killing each other.</v>

446
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

447
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

448
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.243
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get back to a couple things </v>

449
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:30.750
<v Speaker 1>you said there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first.</v>

450
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that I know that the minimum wage</v>

451
00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:33.600
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a big one for you.</v>

452
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:34.434
<v Speaker 1>And even just this morning I write </v>
<v Speaker 1>another story about how Bernie wants </v>

453
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:37.104
<v Speaker 1>this $15 minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The anecdote that I keep using or </v>

454
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:41.600
<v Speaker 1>anecdote that I keep using is that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep traveling,</v>

455
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.170
<v Speaker 1>traveling all over the country right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

456
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>and in almost every airport you go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast food places and they don't have</v>

457
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.080
<v Speaker 2>people anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have ipads.</v>

458
00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:50.914
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now perhaps if you could pay people </v>

459
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:54.520
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would have jobs.</v>

460
00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be the greatest job in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

461
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 2>but it would be the way it's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked.</v>

462
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:58.803
<v Speaker 2>Now we are literally replacing people </v>
<v Speaker 2>with robots that may be inevitable no </v>

463
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:02.794
<v Speaker 2>matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to say that you have to pay people </v>

464
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even from my own business here,</v>

465
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I get people offering to work for me for</v>
<v Speaker 2>free all the time.</v>

466
00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I want to pay people appropriately and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do pay all our people.</v>

467
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:13.883
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that the government would </v>

468
00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:19.510
<v Speaker 2>force me to pay someone x amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems completely bananas.</v>

469
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

470
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.290
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

471
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.730
<v Speaker 1>puts low many low skill workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>auto jobs.</v>

472
00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.773
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

473
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.833
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a teenager is not worth $7 and twenty </v>

474
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.753
<v Speaker 1>five cents per hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>employers who are not in the charity </v>

475
00:21:33.411 --> 00:21:36.320
<v Speaker 1>business are not going to hire that </v>
<v Speaker 1>teenager at that price,</v>

476
00:21:36.321 --> 00:21:39.450
<v Speaker 1>that teenager will go without a job or </v>
<v Speaker 1>go without a job in the,</v>

477
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.423
<v Speaker 1>in the above ground economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make find a job paying more in the </v>

478
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.370
<v Speaker 1>underground economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a different set of problems.</v>

479
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.713
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that is the major unintended </v>

480
00:21:49.371 --> 00:21:51.770
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the minimum wage there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are others,</v>

481
00:21:51.771 --> 00:21:52.850
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the big one.</v>

482
00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

483
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:56.571
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

484
00:21:56.571 --> 00:21:58.070
<v Speaker 1>what people like Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

485
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.913
<v Speaker 1>because I speak to proponents of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage all the time with most of </v>

486
00:22:02.901 --> 00:22:03.734
<v Speaker 1>them do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just stopped the analysis at the </v>

487
00:22:08.061 --> 00:22:09.230
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

488
00:22:09.231 --> 00:22:11.610
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be better to be paid $15 an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and said,</v>

489
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.530
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

490
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.570
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to get to the unintended</v>

491
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:19.580
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think because I think because most</v>

492
00:22:19.581 --> 00:22:20.414
<v Speaker 1>of them believe that they just had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of employers as being a really </v>

493
00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:28.130
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a highly profitable operations.</v>

494
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.680
<v Speaker 1>And so if you raise the minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh sure,</v>

495
00:22:30.681 --> 00:22:31.514
<v Speaker 1>it has a cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cost that's going to be born </v>

496
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:35.510
<v Speaker 1>exclusively by employers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fact.</v>

497
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Most low skilled workers work in highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive industries.</v>

498
00:22:39.081 --> 00:22:40.880
<v Speaker 1>They work in food retail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.270
<v Speaker 1>they work at lawn care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

500
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work in,</v>

501
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.400
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

502
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.940
<v Speaker 1>in supermarkets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants.</v>

503
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.390
<v Speaker 1>These are highly competitive industries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no big profit margin.</v>

504
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.323
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you raise the minimum wage is </v>

505
00:22:52.281 --> 00:22:54.290
<v Speaker 1>not coming out of the profits of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>employers.</v>

506
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.610
<v Speaker 1>It has to come out of some change in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way the employers do their business.</v>

507
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.340
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with automation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

508
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a,</v>

509
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a proper amount of automation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you raise the minimum wage,</v>

510
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.080
<v Speaker 1>you get too much automation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

511
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.020
<v Speaker 1>because you put and too few human </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers.</v>

512
00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.270
<v Speaker 1>And here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to make this clear,</v>

513
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.030
<v Speaker 1>here's another unintended consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage.</v>

514
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.043
<v Speaker 1>And not only does it deny income to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those workers who lose their jobs worse </v>

515
00:23:22.491 --> 00:23:23.324
<v Speaker 1>in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it denies those workers would what's </v>

516
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.600
<v Speaker 1>even more valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely the opportunity to get that first</v>

517
00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.493
<v Speaker 1>piece of job experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the 16 year old who otherwise </v>

518
00:23:33.561 --> 00:23:37.130
<v Speaker 1>would have gotten the job without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage becomes a 17 year old or 18</v>

519
00:23:37.131 --> 00:23:40.100
<v Speaker 1>year old who's still a never employed </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

520
00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Whereas otherwise they would have had </v>
<v Speaker 1>job experience.</v>

521
00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:43.950
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

522
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.840
<v Speaker 1>it swells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>officially swells the ranks of,</v>

523
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of unskilled workers.</v>

524
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.113
<v Speaker 1>Would there be a direct correlation then</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have this whole set of people </v>

525
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:54.014
<v Speaker 1>at this imaginary $15 minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are also going to raise prices on </v>

526
00:23:56.871 --> 00:23:57.920
<v Speaker 1>basic things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

527
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a direct correlation?</v>

528
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Price prices may rise a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you get,</v>

529
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:03.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy's a little bit less </v>

530
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:06.800
<v Speaker 1>efficient and so you get a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>less output,</v>

531
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.760
<v Speaker 1>but the price increases aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't the major problem.</v>

532
00:24:10.761 --> 00:24:15.761
<v Speaker 1>The major problem is employers will find</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to satisfy their customers,</v>

533
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.943
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at slightly higher cost to the </v>

534
00:24:18.231 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 1>employers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at huge cost to those workers who,</v>

535
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 1>who lose their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you've talked to kind of miss on</v>

536
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:27.890
<v Speaker 1>the left that disagree with you on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get what you're saying,</v>

537
00:24:27.891 --> 00:24:28.724
<v Speaker 1>that they're not taking that next step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's someone out there that </v>

538
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:33.500
<v Speaker 1>has made a sound argument that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with you.</v>

539
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:39.920
<v Speaker 1>So there is one sound argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one sound theoretically,</v>

540
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.540
<v Speaker 1>one theoretically coherent argument for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage.</v>

541
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:48.870
<v Speaker 1>And that is if employers have what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called monopsony power vent,</v>

542
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.940
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going need you to find that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

543
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monopsony power.</v>

544
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like monopoly power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except so monopolist is the only seller.</v>

545
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.270
<v Speaker 1>A monopsony says the only buyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

546
00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you're the only buyer of low skill</v>
<v Speaker 1>workers in the market,</v>

547
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:06.020
<v Speaker 1>but you as an employer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you then can be easily shown.</v>

548
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.220
<v Speaker 1>You can keep wages lower than they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise be too low.</v>

549
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.293
<v Speaker 1>And given that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be then shown that if the </v>

550
00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:15.730
<v Speaker 1>government comes in and sets a minimum </v>
<v Speaker 1>wage right,</v>

551
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.220
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

552
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.553
<v Speaker 1>the employer will in fact pay the higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage and no employees will be </v>

553
00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:26.150
<v Speaker 1>harmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a very,</v>

554
00:25:26.151 --> 00:25:31.130
<v Speaker 1>very strict criteria are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strict.</v>

555
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.263
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that that Walmart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's and Burger King and KFC and </v>

556
00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:38.174
<v Speaker 1>all the mom and pop restaurants and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>made services and lawn care services </v>

557
00:25:42.171 --> 00:25:43.790
<v Speaker 1>that we have throughout the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

558
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:44.683
<v Speaker 1>the idea that any one of these is a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone monopoly buyer of low skill </v>

559
00:25:50.001 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 1>workers is just absurd.</v>

560
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.423
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that you write </v>

561
00:25:52.881 --> 00:25:57.881
<v Speaker 1>about a lot is that the idea of middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>class stagnation is actually wrong.</v>

562
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.143
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hear this all the time from </v>

563
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:04.850
<v Speaker 1>politicians for I think my whole life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was ever caring about politics.</v>

564
00:26:04.851 --> 00:26:05.684
<v Speaker 1>It's always that the middle class is </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrinking and the extremes are getting </v>

565
00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:09.260
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

566
00:26:09.261 --> 00:26:10.094
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you actually take a different </v>

567
00:26:11.301 --> 00:26:12.070
<v Speaker 1>position on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

568
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.903
<v Speaker 1>This middle class stagnation thesis is </v>
<v Speaker 1>stated as if it's an established fact </v>

569
00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:17.560
<v Speaker 1>with no arguments against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

570
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:18.463
<v Speaker 1>it's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you were born in the mid </v>

571
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:20.450
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

572
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Seventy six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

573
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So according to this thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

574
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.290
<v Speaker 1>It was right around that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid seventies when.</v>

575
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

576
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.833
<v Speaker 1>It was your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the American middle class had been </v>

577
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:34.910
<v Speaker 1>chugging along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upward hits the mid seventies,</v>

578
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:36.620
<v Speaker 1>and then it's been stagnant ever since.</v>

579
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.453
<v Speaker 1>So ordinary Americans today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so goes the thesis lived no better than </v>

580
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>ordinary Americans lived when Gerald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ford was in the Oval Office.</v>

581
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I think this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

582
00:26:45.721 --> 00:26:46.410
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

583
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

584
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:47.863
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate old enough to remember the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies and although one zone </v>

585
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.750
<v Speaker 1>personal experiences shouldn't be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis for scientific conclusions,</v>

586
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:55.643
<v Speaker 1>they're not irrelevant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I come from a working class US </v>

587
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.773
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember how we lived in the </v>

588
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.270
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember what cars were like.</v>

589
00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I remember when television was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what healthcare was like,</v>

590
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.240
<v Speaker 1>things are a lot better today for </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary Americans.</v>

591
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.530
<v Speaker 1>And so a number of years ago just </v>
<v Speaker 1>started looking into this,</v>

592
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.820
<v Speaker 1>this thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

593
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.803
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our data that you can find that the </v>

594
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:20.100
<v Speaker 1>people who propose this thesis a point </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

595
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

596
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.620
<v Speaker 1>that lends some superficial credence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thesis.</v>

597
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.470
<v Speaker 1>But here's just some of the problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these data.</v>

598
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:29.573
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they adjust for inflation in ways that </v>

599
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.253
<v Speaker 1>vastly overestimate the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation that we've had since the mid </v>

600
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.750
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mean vastly under counting the growth</v>

601
00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:43.020
<v Speaker 1>in real incomes since the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these data,</v>

602
00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:46.310
<v Speaker 1>we'll look at household incomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

603
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:47.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

604
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:47.843
<v Speaker 1>the typical population of the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>household has fallen since the mid 19 </v>

605
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:53.550
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today it didn't sound like much,</v>

606
00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:57.830
<v Speaker 1>but today it's about 11 percent lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it was in 1975 a.</v>

607
00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.820
<v Speaker 1>But that's actually a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant.</v>

608
00:27:59.821 --> 00:28:00.654
<v Speaker 1>So the same amount of income and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>household and it was spread over fewer </v>

609
00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:03.924
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the individual individual people </v>

610
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.193
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

611
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.440
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are richer,</v>

612
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.710
<v Speaker 1>meaning we're just not having as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids that we're not having as many kids.</v>

613
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:11.773
<v Speaker 1>We were becoming wealthier so that now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe not in the last 10 years or </v>

614
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:17.520
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for much of this period,</v>

615
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:18.643
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger people I've been able to move </v>

616
00:28:19.681 --> 00:28:22.380
<v Speaker 1>out of their family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their parents homes at a younger age and</v>

617
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:25.460
<v Speaker 1>start the households younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

618
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.363
<v Speaker 1>older people are able to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live by themselves rather than moving </v>

619
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.300
<v Speaker 1>with their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their children.</v>

620
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:37.010
<v Speaker 1>The quality of goods and the variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>goods and services that Americans,</v>

621
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.633
<v Speaker 1>ordinary Americans have access to today </v>
<v Speaker 1>is astonishing compared to what it was </v>

622
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:43.764
<v Speaker 1>just 40 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually spent a lot of time looking </v>

623
00:28:46.231 --> 00:28:49.400
<v Speaker 1>at catalogs from the mid 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

624
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.880
<v Speaker 1>sears roebuck catalogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can look@sears.com</v>

625
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:58.350
<v Speaker 1>today and you can look at the prices </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we charge back that course.</v>

626
00:28:58.351 --> 00:28:59.184
<v Speaker 1>Nominally they will lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you just take those prices and </v>

627
00:29:01.681 --> 00:29:06.210
<v Speaker 1>you divide them by the wage that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>average American earned back then and do</v>

628
00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:07.044
<v Speaker 1>the same thing for the prices today and </v>
<v Speaker 1>divided by the wage of the average </v>

629
00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:14.070
<v Speaker 1>American owns today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you find in almost all cases is</v>

630
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:14.904
<v Speaker 1>that the amount of time it takes to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to earn enough income to buy a </v>

631
00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:20.400
<v Speaker 1>pair of jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shirt,</v>

632
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.593
<v Speaker 1>a washer and dryer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an airplane ticket is dramatically </v>

633
00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:26.430
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>

634
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:27.061
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

635
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:27.894
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to work as much today as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we did back then in order to get the </v>

636
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:31.860
<v Speaker 1>things that make our standard of living </v>
<v Speaker 1>as high as it is.</v>

637
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.720
<v Speaker 1>So did they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the people that believe in this,</v>

638
00:29:33.721 --> 00:29:35.370
<v Speaker 1>that they just do a great sell job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

639
00:29:35.371 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 1>how did this meme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did this idea get out there?</v>

640
00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:38.364
<v Speaker 1>Because you hear this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the few things that you </v>

641
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.730
<v Speaker 1>hear on both sides of the aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

642
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

643
00:29:43.901 --> 00:29:44.734
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

644
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

645
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.133
<v Speaker 1>I think the Paul Krugman says it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>says it all the time and I think in a </v>

646
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:53.290
<v Speaker 1>way kind of backfire when people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left because they keep saying it.</v>

647
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.124
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that's one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped the drum ups popular support for </v>

648
00:29:58.211 --> 00:29:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

649
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 1>middle class Americans have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>stagnating.</v>

650
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:02.020
<v Speaker 1>So let's do something about it.</v>

651
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.853
<v Speaker 1>Let's electronic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an interesting psychological </v>

652
00:30:04.331 --> 00:30:08.410
<v Speaker 1>thing there because I think maybe most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think they're in the middle,</v>

653
00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:10.570
<v Speaker 1>like they probably think it no matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

654
00:30:10.571 --> 00:30:11.404
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're not destitute and if they're </v>

655
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:14.890
<v Speaker 1>not worth $20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million bucks,</v>

656
00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you probably think basically you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>

657
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a way of making it,</v>

658
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 1>about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's actually not the case.</v>

659
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.233
<v Speaker 1>Your question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not sure exactly exactly why it </v>

660
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:28.564
<v Speaker 1>caught by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this myth caught on and it has held on </v>

661
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:33.670
<v Speaker 1>with such tenacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This myth has been going,</v>

662
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.960
<v Speaker 1>has been around now for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It started in the mid 19 nineties and it</v>

663
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 1>was actually an economist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's now at southern,</v>

664
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.343
<v Speaker 1>at Smu in Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was at the time at an economist at </v>

665
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:43.744
<v Speaker 1>the Dallas Fed guy named Mike Cox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's the first one who really </v>

666
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:47.950
<v Speaker 1>started looking into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

667
00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:48.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

668
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

669
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.850
<v Speaker 1>let's look at various measures of living</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>

670
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:53.683
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at how much ordinary people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are consuming today compared to in the </v>

671
00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.260
<v Speaker 1>mid seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will kind of,</v>

672
00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:58.931
<v Speaker 1>let's let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

673
00:30:58.931 --> 00:30:59.764
<v Speaker 1>let's look at what happens when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust for income using better </v>

674
00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:03.300
<v Speaker 1>inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adjusters come,</v>

675
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:04.523
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Cox Found that my work is </v>

676
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:11.830
<v Speaker 1>derivative of my cox is that once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start doing this,</v>

677
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:16.270
<v Speaker 1>this whole middle class stagnation thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>just crumbled into dust.</v>

678
00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:17.104
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not to say that there are no </v>

679
00:31:20.231 --> 00:31:21.064
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not to say that the middleclass </v>

680
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.160
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be even wealthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had not had,</v>

681
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.003
<v Speaker 1>they'd been better policies in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you think those policies might </v>

682
00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:31.420
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is to say that it's just crazy to</v>

683
00:31:31.421 --> 00:31:32.254
<v Speaker 1>believe that an ordinary American or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary American family in 2018 has a </v>

684
00:31:36.251 --> 00:31:37.084
<v Speaker 1>standard of living that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from that of an </v>

685
00:31:38.591 --> 00:31:40.750
<v Speaker 1>ordinary American family in 1975.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

686
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.733
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what basically the economics</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like if you're considered in the </v>

687
00:31:45.701 --> 00:31:46.534
<v Speaker 1>middle class right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the economics there really like </v>

688
00:31:48.911 --> 00:31:50.800
<v Speaker 1>numbers that you look at on both sides </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

689
00:31:50.801 --> 00:31:51.634
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what middle class is because I </v>

690
00:31:52.751 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 1>think that's part of the problem.</v>

691
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 1>It is this sort of a morphis term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

692
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

693
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that they are the,</v>

694
00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.820
<v Speaker 1>the Census Bureau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Among others,</v>

695
00:32:00.821 --> 00:32:04.060
<v Speaker 1>they will divide household income into </v>
<v Speaker 1>quintiles.</v>

696
00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't recall what those numbers are at</v>

697
00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:07.894
<v Speaker 1>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a common definition should take the </v>

698
00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:12.580
<v Speaker 1>three middle quintile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd get rid of the top 20 percent.</v>

699
00:32:12.581 --> 00:32:14.740
<v Speaker 1>You were at the bottom 20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the middle 60 percent.</v>

700
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the middle class and upper </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>

701
00:32:17.231 --> 00:32:17.681
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>

702
00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:18.514
<v Speaker 1>lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

703
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.393
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Census Bureau does something </v>

704
00:32:20.411 --> 00:32:21.244
<v Speaker 1>interesting from time to time it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it divides household income and two </v>

705
00:32:26.651 --> 00:32:28.560
<v Speaker 1>different categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than 15,000,</v>

706
00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.020
<v Speaker 1>15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 25,000</v>

707
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.903
<v Speaker 1>on it and on up to like I think 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and above and attracts adjusting for </v>

708
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:37.174
<v Speaker 1>inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tracks household incomes over time </v>

709
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.443
<v Speaker 1>and you can in a perverse way finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>these data that the middle class in </v>

710
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:46.820
<v Speaker 1>America is disappearing.</v>

711
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:47.983
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's disappearing into the upper </v>

712
00:32:48.861 --> 00:32:49.694
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the percentage of </v>

713
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:55.421
<v Speaker 1>households in America who are earning a </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lowest percentages,</v>

714
00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're shrinking the only,</v>

715
00:32:59.130 --> 00:32:59.963
<v Speaker 1>the only categories in which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of households in the US are </v>

716
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.440
<v Speaker 1>increasing or in the upper income </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

717
00:33:06.441 --> 00:33:07.274
<v Speaker 1>And so actually I think the very lowest </v>
<v Speaker 1>it might have ticked up a little bit </v>

718
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.453
<v Speaker 1>like the blessed in $15,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the great middle they have fewer </v>

719
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:17.210
<v Speaker 1>households percentagewise earning in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those categories today,</v>

720
00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 1>but more earning $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>annually and above.</v>

721
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:24.050
<v Speaker 1>And so in one sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

722
00:33:24.051 --> 00:33:25.130
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's getting Richard,</v>

723
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:26.930
<v Speaker 1>there is no evidence that we're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor.</v>

724
00:33:26.931 --> 00:33:27.764
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence that it</v>

725
00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:28.601
<v Speaker 2>meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

726
00:33:28.601 --> 00:33:32.740
<v Speaker 2>So we talked a little bit in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancillary way about taxes earlier,</v>

727
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.860
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not an economist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to lay out what I think is</v>

728
00:33:35.861 --> 00:33:36.694
<v Speaker 2>sort of a fair tax system that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent with all the ideals that </v>

729
00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:42.210
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want you to probably get.</v>

730
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Have I had my ideas either I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be either I'm going to blow your mind or</v>

731
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.070
<v Speaker 2>you're going to tell me that I'm way </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

732
00:33:48.071 --> 00:33:50.830
<v Speaker 2>So something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I've said a couple times,</v>

733
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.980
<v Speaker 2>is that I'm basically four attacks a </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat tax.</v>

734
00:33:53.981 --> 00:33:57.160
<v Speaker 2>You don't get rid of exemptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's about 15 percent,</v>

735
00:33:57.161 --> 00:33:58.690
<v Speaker 2>but we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can fiddle with the numbers,</v>

736
00:33:58.691 --> 00:34:03.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's about 15 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would exempt everyone making let's say</v>

737
00:34:03.371 --> 00:34:04.204
<v Speaker 2>less than like 40 grand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even 50 grand so that they have a </v>

738
00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 2>little more disposable income that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do things which,</v>

739
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:12.040
<v Speaker 2>which I think is good for them and good </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the economy.</v>

740
00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.053
<v Speaker 2>And then just because I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have a little bit of a guilty </v>

741
00:34:15.641 --> 00:34:16.474
<v Speaker 2>liberal in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would even be willing to do some sort </v>

742
00:34:19.601 --> 00:34:24.601
<v Speaker 2>of progressive tax if you're over say 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>million a year or something like that,</v>

743
00:34:25.031 --> 00:34:25.864
<v Speaker 2>even though I know it's not right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure you can get rid of that by </v>

744
00:34:28.421 --> 00:34:29.254
<v Speaker 2>the end of this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's still a piece of me that </v>

745
00:34:30.971 --> 00:34:33.850
<v Speaker 2>says that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically saying that for the huge,</v>

746
00:34:33.851 --> 00:34:34.684
<v Speaker 2>vast majority of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 percent lidl exemptions may be a </v>

747
00:34:38.831 --> 00:34:39.664
<v Speaker 2>little trickery on the high end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's consistent with the sort </v>

748
00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:45.670
<v Speaker 2>of classical liberal idea of minimal </v>
<v Speaker 2>involvement and,</v>

749
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.790
<v Speaker 2>and equality of opportunity and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all paying in.</v>

750
00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.070
<v Speaker 2>And hopefully we'd call it a slimmer </v>
<v Speaker 2>trimmer government,</v>

751
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

752
00:34:51.571 --> 00:34:52.850
<v Speaker 2>So some glimmering in your eye.</v>

753
00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

754
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as I said earlier,</v>

755
00:34:54.381 --> 00:34:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the distinguishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>features of an economist has always yes.</v>

756
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.823
<v Speaker 1>Compared to what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

757
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.690
<v Speaker 1>As compared to what we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

758
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:00.830
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

759
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:01.970
<v Speaker 1>that's close to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

760
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.863
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it as compared to what my </v>

761
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.580
<v Speaker 1>actual ideal would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that we're going to have taxes,</v>

762
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite my ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would indeed get rid of the,</v>

763
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:11.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

764
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 1>the progression at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the guilty part of me.</v>

765
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:15.764
<v Speaker 1>I think that still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way I look at the way I look at </v>

766
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:22.060
<v Speaker 1>people who earn those kinds of incomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming they earn,</v>

767
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 1>and most of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they earn these incomes in the market.</v>

768
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:25.783
<v Speaker 1>That means that these people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially good at making life better </v>

769
00:35:28.491 --> 00:35:29.324
<v Speaker 1>for ordinary Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're especially good at creating </v>

770
00:35:30.831 --> 00:35:31.664
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're especially good at increasing </v>

771
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.000
<v Speaker 1>the value of my 401k.</v>

772
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:35.923
<v Speaker 1>But what would you say when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't need eight yachts and </v>

773
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.160
<v Speaker 1>helicopters and all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

774
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I would say they earned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's theirs.</v>

775
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not up to me to say what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's their money.</v>

776
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I can make an argument against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know is there's a lot.</v>

777
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.863
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your system is better than what we have </v>

778
00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:52.374
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but definitely if we're going to have </v>

779
00:35:54.481 --> 00:35:55.314
<v Speaker 1>income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxation of flat tax and I'm willing to </v>

780
00:35:57.331 --> 00:35:59.460
<v Speaker 1>have the exemption for the lower lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>incomes,</v>

781
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 1>flat taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to go.</v>

782
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

783
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:02.903
<v Speaker 1>not only does it prevent a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political chicanery messing with </v>

784
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.970
<v Speaker 1>brackets and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

785
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.103
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is economically a better system when </v>

786
00:36:14.701 --> 00:36:15.534
<v Speaker 1>you tax all income earning activities at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same rate than the relative prices </v>

787
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:23.310
<v Speaker 1>of different types of labor services </v>
<v Speaker 1>stays the same.</v>

788
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:24.263
<v Speaker 1>When you have progressive taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you create greater distortions in the </v>

789
00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:31.080
<v Speaker 1>economy and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes us as an,</v>

790
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:32.220
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

791
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Speaker 1>as residents of this economy.</v>

792
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.373
<v Speaker 1>It makes us all a little bit less </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy than we otherwise we'd be </v>

793
00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:38.820
<v Speaker 1>because the economy has to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these distortions.</v>

794
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.480
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do about spending?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because at the end of the day,</v>

795
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:43.314
<v Speaker 1>that seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least when we're talking about this </v>

796
00:36:44.191 --> 00:36:45.024
<v Speaker 1>from a government perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really all about spending that you </v>

797
00:36:47.671 --> 00:36:51.240
<v Speaker 1>can tax out the Wazoo and regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that tanks the economy or,</v>

798
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.240
<v Speaker 1>or fixes it or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's almost irrelevant.</v>

799
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 1>If you just keep spending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because of the amount of debt</v>

800
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:57.714
<v Speaker 1>we have and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know we're never going to pay it </v>

801
00:36:58.951 --> 00:36:59.784
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is why it's probably good that we </v>

802
00:37:00.361 --> 00:37:02.150
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a whole other.</v>

803
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole other discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

804
00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:04.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one day if China calls him the </v>

805
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:08.630
<v Speaker 1>debt lateral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

806
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.653
<v Speaker 1>but how do you reign in spending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this seems to be the thing that </v>

807
00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.300
<v Speaker 1>all the trump people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

808
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.133
<v Speaker 1>They all thought he was going to reign </v>
<v Speaker 1>in spending this on quite the opposite </v>

809
00:37:15.751 --> 00:37:16.511
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

810
00:37:16.511 --> 00:37:17.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

811
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

812
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.970
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the big question,</v>

813
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.853
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can speculate about changing the </v>

814
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:26.604
<v Speaker 1>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put in constitutional balanced budget </v>

815
00:37:28.201 --> 00:37:30.660
<v Speaker 1>amendments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutional caps on spending.</v>

816
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.673
<v Speaker 1>I'm skeptical of all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government has many ways to get around </v>

817
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.600
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these paper tiger provisions.</v>

818
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:37.883
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is the problem is Americans </v>

819
00:37:40.741 --> 00:37:42.810
<v Speaker 1>today look to government and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

820
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.440
<v Speaker 1>they basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're spending other people's money and</v>

821
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:47.760
<v Speaker 1>so if you're spending other people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

822
00:37:47.761 --> 00:37:49.260
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to spend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

823
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.183
<v Speaker 1>my former colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russ Roberts had a piece in the Wall </v>

824
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Street Journal many years ago entitled </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like if you were paying,</v>

825
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm having steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine,</v>

826
00:37:56.551 --> 00:37:57.384
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that we all go to a restaurant </v>

827
00:37:58.591 --> 00:38:00.030
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different menu items,</v>

828
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:00.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

829
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to a restaurant and you and </v>

830
00:38:01.661 --> 00:38:03.510
<v Speaker 1>you're picking up your part of the tab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

831
00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:04.280
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

832
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.113
<v Speaker 1>you may order a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's because it's worthwhile to </v>

833
00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.310
<v Speaker 1>and you will have to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

834
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.383
<v Speaker 1>but you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have to pay for you might not </v>

835
00:38:10.561 --> 00:38:11.680
<v Speaker 1>already sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might order a,</v>

836
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.180
<v Speaker 1>a less expensive dish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's going to be even,</v>

837
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.033
<v Speaker 1>it's just to be shared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then based then the bulk of your extra </v>

838
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.630
<v Speaker 1>expenditure is shared with the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to dinner with.</v>

839
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's true for every person that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dinner.</v>

840
00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.653
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you wind up with this bizarre </v>

841
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.233
<v Speaker 1>circumstance where every person acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationally winds up ordering too much </v>

842
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.570
<v Speaker 1>winds up asking of the restaurant too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

843
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:37.660
<v Speaker 1>We wind up asking if our too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to pay for it.</v>

844
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 1>The resources do not fall out of the sky</v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

845
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.660
<v Speaker 1>They're coming from somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

846
00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.673
<v Speaker 1>and because we're spending too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're taking resources from where they </v>

847
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:48.370
<v Speaker 1>would be better used and putting them </v>
<v Speaker 1>were really,</v>

848
00:38:48.371 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 1>none of us want them to be used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all wind up using them there.</v>

849
00:38:51.521 --> 00:38:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I know you said before that an anecdotal</v>
<v Speaker 1>story is not proof of a bigger theory,</v>

850
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:57.280
<v Speaker 1>but as you're saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reminded,</v>

851
00:38:57.281 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever said this </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly publicly before at my brother's</v>

852
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Bachelor Party when I was a struggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>comic and I had no money.</v>

853
00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had maybe 50 bucks in my pocket.</v>

854
00:39:04.991 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the best man.</v>

855
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 1>All his friends were in banking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers and they all had money.</v>

856
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:09.754
<v Speaker 1>Big rollers were at a fancy one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one fancy plays the Borgata in </v>

857
00:39:12.731 --> 00:39:13.564
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one fancy nice place in Atlantic </v>

858
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.120
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're sitting around this huge table</v>

859
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.930
<v Speaker 1>at a really super fancy restaurant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

860
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.190
<v Speaker 1>and all the entrees are 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>9,000</v>

861
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:24.490
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>

862
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And I'm looking at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

863
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to get the chicken for maybe</v>

864
00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:30.740
<v Speaker 1>50 bucks or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was sitting with my,</v>

865
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:34.000
<v Speaker 1>my brother's one friend who also was </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of struggling like I was.</v>

866
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.290
<v Speaker 1>We're both saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

867
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.670
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get the chicken for 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>

868
00:39:36.671 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 1>We go around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's getting steak,</v>

869
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:38.861
<v Speaker 1>lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steak,</v>

870
00:39:38.861 --> 00:39:39.521
<v Speaker 1>lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steak,</v>

871
00:39:39.521 --> 00:39:40.151
<v Speaker 1>lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steak,</v>

872
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:42.010
<v Speaker 1>lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets to my friend Josh.</v>

873
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:43.230
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the whole time he's gone.</v>

874
00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting the chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The waitress says,</v>

875
00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:46.061
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

876
00:39:46.061 --> 00:39:48.370
<v Speaker 1>lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I just said steak like that,</v>

877
00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:49.204
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's exactly what you're talking </v>

878
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:50.884
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You suddenly lose concept of what's in </v>

879
00:39:53.171 --> 00:39:54.900
<v Speaker 1>your pocket somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna Happen,</v>

880
00:39:54.901 --> 00:39:56.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets the bill's going to be shared.</v>

881
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

882
00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.423
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the additional cost to you of ordering </v>

883
00:39:59.891 --> 00:40:04.570
<v Speaker 1>states adopt a tiny fraction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual additional cost to the steak.</v>

884
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with government today.</v>

885
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:08.223
<v Speaker 1>We have people in Washington spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's money for the benefit of </v>

886
00:40:11.381 --> 00:40:14.620
<v Speaker 1>yet other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>

887
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.420
<v Speaker 1>you just get too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much spending.</v>

888
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

889
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.070
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a better way to say it,</v>

890
00:40:19.071 --> 00:40:20.730
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound very economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

891
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:21.573
<v Speaker 1>but we've lost the ethic of respecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's property once government </v>

892
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:27.274
<v Speaker 1>gets money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once government officials figure out </v>

893
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Speaker 1>something that they fancy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

894
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.720
<v Speaker 1>is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it may or may not really be good.</v>

895
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:35.973
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't mean necessarily it's </v>

896
00:40:36.701 --> 00:40:37.534
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe a good project that doesn't </v>

897
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:43.030
<v Speaker 1>mean that therefore we should go ahead </v>
<v Speaker 1>and spend money on it.</v>

898
00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:43.923
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an insufficient connection </v>

899
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:48.010
<v Speaker 1>between the spending and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

900
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.700
<v Speaker 1>and the experience of the cost of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources that go into the spending.</v>

901
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:56.290
<v Speaker 1>How much of this do you think is not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic problem but a political problem</v>

902
00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:59.860
<v Speaker 1>so that if a politician was to get this </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

903
00:40:59.861 --> 00:41:00.694
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's some magical </v>
<v Speaker 1>politician out there who really </v>

904
00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:05.890
<v Speaker 1>understands economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he knows if he goes to the Senate.</v>

905
00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:08.080
<v Speaker 1>So I suspect rand Paul's kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

906
00:41:08.081 --> 00:41:13.081
<v Speaker 1>I think he basically gets this and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does fight the best fight generally that</v>

907
00:41:13.181 --> 00:41:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I think he can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that they,</v>

908
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:19.090
<v Speaker 1>these guys want to get reelected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying to people,</v>

909
00:41:19.091 --> 00:41:22.880
<v Speaker 1>we're going to spend less on you even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though you know it's.</v>

910
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.820
<v Speaker 1>It's the best thing we can do for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

911
00:41:24.821 --> 00:41:25.654
<v Speaker 1>it's going to free you up one day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to tank the economy and </v>

912
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:31.420
<v Speaker 1>make us slaves to a foreign nation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

913
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.720
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't work politically because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the easy answer of people more.</v>

914
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's face it.</v>

915
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Each politician has a timeframe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>extends to the next election.</v>

916
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the case of members of the house,</v>

917
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:45.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the only two years case of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

918
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.270
<v Speaker 1>That's four senators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

919
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.450
<v Speaker 1>that's not a long time frame.</v>

920
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.483
<v Speaker 1>Anything beyond that timeframe is </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant to that person politically </v>

921
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 1>today or to make it relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person has to have an ethic that is</v>

922
00:41:57.231 --> 00:41:58.064
<v Speaker 1>very rare and unusual among politicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people with that ethic tend not to </v>

923
00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.450
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to succeed in politics.</v>

924
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Handful do manage to get in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very few.</v>

925
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:06.703
<v Speaker 1>So you have people without that ethic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just looking towards the </v>

926
00:42:08.721 --> 00:42:10.130
<v Speaker 1>next election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is at most,</v>

927
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.890
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only two years away for house member and</v>

928
00:42:12.891 --> 00:42:15.080
<v Speaker 1>so if the bill is coming due two and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half years from now,</v>

929
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:16.543
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if whatever other costs are going to </v>

930
00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and a half years from now,</v>

931
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

932
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.850
<v Speaker 1>or alternatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

933
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:23.640
<v Speaker 1>if taking some action that's only going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

934
00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:24.890
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have costs today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

935
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 1>but huge benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how huge two years from now,</v>

936
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:31.100
<v Speaker 1>four years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to take it because it's,</v>

937
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.473
<v Speaker 1>that will do nothing to get them past </v>
<v Speaker 1>that next hurdle which is getting </v>

938
00:42:34.431 --> 00:42:35.570
<v Speaker 1>elected reelected.</v>

939
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.470
<v Speaker 1>So in a very depressing sense or in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of dystopian future sentence,</v>

940
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:40.603
<v Speaker 1>are we in a certain way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we on a pathway to destruction no </v>

941
00:42:43.221 --> 00:42:44.810
<v Speaker 1>matter what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>

942
00:42:44.811 --> 00:42:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you take that line of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>long enough,</v>

943
00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:51.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a sort of weak political crew</v>

944
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.930
<v Speaker 1>dealing in ways that are the reverse of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how economically we can be successful.</v>

945
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much always going off the off the</v>

946
00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:04.220
<v Speaker 1>cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So despite all that upset,</v>

947
00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I remain optimistic and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure why I feel the same way.</v>

948
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I remain optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

949
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:12.583
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still have a respect for private </v>

950
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:17.054
<v Speaker 1>property in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were still a very entrepreneurial </v>

951
00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.550
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

952
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:27.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still hold politicians to.</v>

953
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Some of this is less now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to some level of,</v>

954
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:36.200
<v Speaker 1>of responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that,</v>

955
00:43:36.201 --> 00:43:38.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my libertarian friends are going to get.</v>

956
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.050
<v Speaker 1>We're saying I think there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something there,</v>

957
00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.680
<v Speaker 1>a look with the political problem has </v>
<v Speaker 1>always been there.</v>

958
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:49.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the US Constitution in the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>up until about eight years ago maybe did</v>

959
00:43:49.941 --> 00:43:53.420
<v Speaker 1>serve more as a constraint that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>largely been shoved away.</v>

960
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:55.363
<v Speaker 1>But by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've still prospered over the past 80 </v>

961
00:43:58.251 --> 00:43:59.630
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

962
00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:00.763
<v Speaker 1>almost in spite of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this something is something in the </v>

963
00:44:03.981 --> 00:44:08.750
<v Speaker 1>American mindset that something in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>gumption,</v>

964
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:12.230
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to sound like a mobile </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rah Rah,</v>

965
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:16.730
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about this society</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ours that remains,</v>

966
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:21.710
<v Speaker 1>remains relatively open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remains relatively free property.</v>

967
00:44:21.711 --> 00:44:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Private property rights remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively secure.</v>

968
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.393
<v Speaker 1>I think we still have something of a of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a rule of law in in place and what I've </v>

969
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.883
<v Speaker 1>learned in the 40 or so years that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been pondering these issues is that a </v>

970
00:44:36.061 --> 00:44:39.660
<v Speaker 1>free society is far more robust than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>once believed it to be,</v>

971
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:44.010
<v Speaker 1>which is not to excuse or justify any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abuses that it takes,</v>

972
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's really robust and I have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>good sense of where the point is.</v>

973
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it's indestructable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

974
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:53.303
<v Speaker 1>but I have no good sense of where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point is where you hit that point and </v>

975
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:57.690
<v Speaker 1>suddenly things are destined to go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

976
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.860
<v Speaker 1>into the gutter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may be moving there now.</v>

977
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:02.963
<v Speaker 1>I have a 21 year old son for his sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly hope we're not close to </v>

978
00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my gosh,</v>

979
00:45:09.031 --> 00:45:09.864
<v Speaker 1>if you look back to the 19 thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think things will even worse than </v>

980
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.140
<v Speaker 1>idealize governed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

981
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

982
00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:19.950
<v Speaker 1>the trend of government wise than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are today and yet we did pretty well.</v>

983
00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.273
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that you just said idealize </v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that I focus </v>

984
00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.730
<v Speaker 2>on here is talking about ideas for </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

985
00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.920
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole purpose of what I do.</v>

986
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.963
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that these ideas related to</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom and the individual and laissez </v>

987
00:45:34.341 --> 00:45:35.174
<v Speaker 2>faire capitalism and all of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've discussed here are taking </v>

988
00:45:37.821 --> 00:45:39.380
<v Speaker 2>root again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's how I started.</v>

989
00:45:39.381 --> 00:45:43.200
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned my interview with Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soul right before we started and I sense</v>

990
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:43.971
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

991
00:45:43.971 --> 00:45:44.804
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only tell you what I'm personally </v>

992
00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:47.520
<v Speaker 2>feeling and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I.</v>

993
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:51.340
<v Speaker 2>The feedback I get and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I said to Thomas or to Dr Saul,</v>

994
00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:52.183
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you realize that the renaissance of </v>

995
00:45:54.531 --> 00:45:55.910
<v Speaker 2>your work is having and I think he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda,</v>

996
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:59.120
<v Speaker 2>he's Kinda just over it personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's proud of his work,</v>

997
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.960
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't be.</v>

998
00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course they shouldn't be,</v>

999
00:46:01.071 --> 00:46:03.470
<v Speaker 2>but I think just on a personal note,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of like,</v>

1000
00:46:03.471 --> 00:46:05.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing this for a long time and</v>

1001
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.983
<v Speaker 2>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really sense these things are </v>

1002
00:46:07.281 --> 00:46:08.114
<v Speaker 2>taking root again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the mainstream media won't </v>

1003
00:46:09.111 --> 00:46:09.944
<v Speaker 2>let you really believe that and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>still will always elevate the people </v>

1004
00:46:12.621 --> 00:46:13.454
<v Speaker 2>that are pushing a lot of the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialist stuff instead of some people </v>

1005
00:46:16.131 --> 00:46:16.790
<v Speaker 2>with some.</v>

1006
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:17.623
<v Speaker 1>So getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting back to something we said </v>

1007
00:46:18.651 --> 00:46:19.484
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it took a lot of people by </v>

1008
00:46:20.661 --> 00:46:25.490
<v Speaker 1>surprise in the late 19 seventies when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas for cutting marginal tax rates</v>

1009
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.890
<v Speaker 1>directly deregulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1010
00:46:27.891 --> 00:46:29.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took hold.</v>

1011
00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:32.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman,</v>

1012
00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:33.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1013
00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:37.780
<v Speaker 1>my late colleague James Buchanan had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been working years earlier in helping to</v>

1014
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.070
<v Speaker 1>hire years early attempt to make these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas sound and,</v>

1015
00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.420
<v Speaker 1>and accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were in place.</v>

1016
00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:48.710
<v Speaker 1>And when the crisis of the seventies hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas had an effect.</v>

1017
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:49.943
<v Speaker 1>A No one knows the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future is not destined to repeat </v>

1018
00:46:52.701 --> 00:46:53.534
<v Speaker 1>itself in the way that it did then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are a lot of really good </v>

1019
00:46:56.391 --> 00:46:58.190
<v Speaker 1>people are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing great work.</v>

1020
00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of really creative young</v>

1021
00:47:01.971 --> 00:47:06.200
<v Speaker 1>people today push refining these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>polishing ideas,</v>

1022
00:47:06.201 --> 00:47:11.100
<v Speaker 1>presenting them to the general public in</v>
<v Speaker 1>new and more interesting ways and uh,</v>

1023
00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a hope over experience.</v>

1024
00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that hope over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope over reality.</v>

1025
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:22.790
<v Speaker 1>But I actually believe that these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>are strong.</v>

1026
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I think they are appealing and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are out there and well today in our</v>

1027
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.160
<v Speaker 1>made 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>May,</v>

1028
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.770
<v Speaker 1>2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't see when they'll take root,</v>

1029
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 1>but I think that they will in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect us.</v>

1030
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.313
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is the optimist in you and I </v>

1031
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:44.680
<v Speaker 1>have that too because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could we do what we do?</v>

1032
00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>

1033
00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:46.183
<v Speaker 1>if the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you would look to me 10 minutes ago </v>

1034
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:48.041
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1035
00:47:48.041 --> 00:47:48.874
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to go off the edge there then </v>

1036
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:52.773
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would have had some of the booze </v>

1037
00:47:54.431 --> 00:47:57.100
<v Speaker 1>you have about behind Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just so drinking right now.</v>

1038
00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Just wait for Armageddon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:47:59.200 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1040
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1041
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.240
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

1042
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.103
<v Speaker 1>Here's something that I did not fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate 20 years ago that I do </v>

1043
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.333
<v Speaker 1>appreciate it now.</v>

1044
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Twenty years ago I was a more hard nosed</v>
<v Speaker 1>economist.</v>

1045
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Now ideas are really irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't matter that much.</v>

1046
00:48:12.131 --> 00:48:12.911
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1047
00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:15.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the institutional constraints.</v>

1048
00:48:15.401 --> 00:48:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I do think institutional constraints </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

1049
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:22.170
<v Speaker 1>They're important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've come to see ideas as by far the</v>

1050
00:48:22.361 --> 00:48:23.194
<v Speaker 1>single most important constraint and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel for a society largely affected by </v>

1051
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.030
<v Speaker 1>the work of Deirdre mccloskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For.</v>

1052
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pat on.</v>

1053
00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:34.010
<v Speaker 1>It was one of my favorite shots that met</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1054
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Interviewed deirdre's work has </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced me greatly and her work.</v>

1055
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:38.374
<v Speaker 1>She's not the only one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's done more than any other </v>

1056
00:48:39.431 --> 00:48:40.264
<v Speaker 1>modern economists to make the case for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the role of ideas and I think she's </v>

1057
00:48:42.911 --> 00:48:44.590
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's correct in that.</v>

1058
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.560
<v Speaker 1>So in that you must be incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful then because I mean,</v>

1059
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I feel the idea revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson now and</v>

1060
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I keep going up there and saying there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

1061
00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.630
<v Speaker 1>there's the right kind of revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1062
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 1>We're not killing each other in streets </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

1063
00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.040
<v Speaker 1>And how does that get stopped by an idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution?</v>

1064
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at the beginning I mentioned that</v>

1065
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.013
<v Speaker 1>I came to economics because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressed how economics explained </v>

1066
00:49:06.971 --> 00:49:09.160
<v Speaker 1>they'll gasoline shortages in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

1067
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:10.690
<v Speaker 1>So I know if you remember a few years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

1068
00:49:10.691 --> 00:49:11.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline,</v>

1069
00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Obama was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline prices are rising,</v>

1070
00:49:14.411 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 1>people are complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the importance of idea ideas.</v>

1071
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were no serious calls,</v>

1072
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:20.943
<v Speaker 1>even the in the Obama administration to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to 1970 style price caps on an </v>

1073
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.600
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took that as a,</v>

1074
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:28.503
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a good sign that's saying it won't </v>

1075
00:49:30.311 --> 00:49:31.144
<v Speaker 1>happen in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe the reason that was the </v>

1076
00:49:33.791 --> 00:49:38.791
<v Speaker 1>case is because the economists who ics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman and among the others who</v>

1077
00:49:39.071 --> 00:49:43.210
<v Speaker 1>explain the devastating roles of price </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceilings on energy,</v>

1078
00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:44.680
<v Speaker 1>those ideas was still around.</v>

1079
00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.513
<v Speaker 1>They was still out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still out there and they prevented </v>

1080
00:49:47.861 --> 00:49:52.450
<v Speaker 1>anyone who would propose such policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously from being taken seriously.</v>

1081
00:49:52.451 --> 00:49:53.284
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that notion of returning to the </v>

1082
00:49:55.901 --> 00:49:56.734
<v Speaker 1>seventies style price caps just never </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a hearing a few years ago when </v>

1083
00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.900
<v Speaker 1>gasoline prices were high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

1084
00:50:01.901 --> 00:50:02.291
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1085
00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:07.030
<v Speaker 1>that that's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a data point that supports our optimism.</v>

1086
00:50:07.031 --> 00:50:07.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1087
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:08.411
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1088
00:50:08.411 --> 00:50:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1089
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:09.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a long game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1090
00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the point.</v>

1091
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:12.003
<v Speaker 1>It is a long game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk a little bit around </v>

1092
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:15.820
<v Speaker 1>regulation before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we wrap up,</v>

1093
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may know him,</v>

1094
00:50:17.771 --> 00:50:20.200
<v Speaker 1>the biology professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bret Weinstein,</v>

1095
00:50:20.201 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 1>who's been on the show and he said he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine.</v>

1096
00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made an interesting comment to me the</v>

1097
00:50:25.421 --> 00:50:26.700
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe he tweeted it out and then</v>

1098
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:27.590
<v Speaker 1>we discussed it a little bit</v>

1099
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.761
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1100
00:50:28.761 --> 00:50:29.594
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're taking the true libertarian </v>

1101
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 2>approach and you're against all </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation,</v>

1102
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.273
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you saying that you want no </v>

1103
00:50:35.091 --> 00:50:37.850
<v Speaker 2>regulation over the airlines for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example?</v>

1104
00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:40.640
<v Speaker 2>They have any safety regulations or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that and what?</v>

1105
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.640
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have a ton of time to get into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation.</v>

1106
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said Brett,</v>

1107
00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:46.010
<v Speaker 2>very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would say is I think airlines are</v>

1108
00:50:46.011 --> 00:50:46.844
<v Speaker 2>in the business of getting people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>one place to another and they do all </v>

1109
00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:50.234
<v Speaker 2>their due diligence and if the idea of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>government bureaucrat coming in to make </v>

1110
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:54.104
<v Speaker 2>sure that this little thing is this way </v>
<v Speaker 2>as if they have more knowledge about it </v>

1111
00:50:56.571 --> 00:50:58.820
<v Speaker 2>than the airline people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that to be pretty faulty,</v>

1112
00:50:58.821 --> 00:50:59.654
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we sort of left the conversation </v>

1113
00:51:00.651 --> 00:51:01.484
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1114
00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:03.653
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the right amount of regulation </v>

1115
00:51:04.681 --> 00:51:05.880
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Libertarian,</v>

1116
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:06.743
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in favor of huge amounts of </v>

1117
00:51:07.861 --> 00:51:10.680
<v Speaker 1>regulation and I'm not being facetious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love regulation.</v>

1118
00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I believe the best regulator really </v>
<v Speaker 1>given this is the market.</v>

1119
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.113
<v Speaker 1>It's a competitive market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is consumers being able to spend their </v>

1120
00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:17.530
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1121
00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:19.860
<v Speaker 1>as they choose and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not to spend it as they choose.</v>

1122
00:51:19.861 --> 00:51:22.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the freedom of different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1123
00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 1>producers and entrepreneurs to enter </v>
<v Speaker 1>markets or leave markets as they choose.</v>

1124
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.060
<v Speaker 1>It's the competition among producers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where real regulation comes from.</v>

1125
00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.010
<v Speaker 1>The market regulates activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1126
00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:35.430
<v Speaker 1>you're right about the incidence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>airlines.</v>

1127
00:51:35.431 --> 00:51:36.600
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1128
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:40.800
<v Speaker 1>no one has a stronger incentive to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that a multimillion dollar piece of</v>

1129
00:51:40.801 --> 00:51:43.140
<v Speaker 1>machinery doesn't just willy nilly fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the sky,</v>

1130
00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.050
<v Speaker 1>then the owner of that multimillion </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar piece of machinery,</v>

1131
00:51:46.051 --> 00:51:48.100
<v Speaker 1>namely the airlines or the company that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1132
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.320
<v Speaker 1>they're renting it from.</v>

1133
00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:51.690
<v Speaker 1>And so the competition among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>airlines,</v>

1134
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1135
00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:56.220
<v Speaker 1>the need for them to protect their </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>

1136
00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:57.443
<v Speaker 1>that is a tremendous source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation and it's a very nuanced </v>

1137
00:52:01.711 --> 00:52:04.530
<v Speaker 1>source of regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets it right and it's not subject to</v>

1138
00:52:04.531 --> 00:52:06.870
<v Speaker 1>political control or political </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulation.</v>

1139
00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:11.580
<v Speaker 1>So a government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So government regulation is too often,</v>

1140
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:12.883
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually deregulation in the worst </v>

1141
00:52:14.641 --> 00:52:15.474
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's government relieving businesses </v>

1142
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:19.163
<v Speaker 1>have the need to be as responsive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers as they would otherwise need </v>

1143
00:52:21.901 --> 00:52:22.271
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

1144
00:52:22.271 --> 00:52:22.610
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1145
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:23.780
<v Speaker 1>we call for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1146
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:25.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1147
00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.600
<v Speaker 1>occupational licensing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a form of regulation.</v>

1148
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1149
00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:32.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of deregulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deregulation.</v>

1150
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.220
<v Speaker 1>It deregulates the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1151
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:36.263
<v Speaker 1>existing producers in the market from </v>
<v Speaker 1>having to be as responsive as they </v>

1152
00:52:39.361 --> 00:52:41.730
<v Speaker 1>otherwise would to consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1153
00:52:41.731 --> 00:52:43.770
<v Speaker 1>this would be like you have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>license to cut hair,</v>

1154
00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.170
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1155
00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1156
00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.830
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm a hair braider or a barber a or,</v>

1157
00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:52.760
<v Speaker 1>or an electrician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if this,</v>

1158
00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.940
<v Speaker 1>if the government prevents people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>entering in competition with me,</v>

1159
00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:58.163
<v Speaker 1>that makes my life easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to be as responsive to </v>

1160
00:53:00.211 --> 00:53:01.500
<v Speaker 1>consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can charge higher prices,</v>

1161
00:53:01.501 --> 00:53:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I could supply a less high quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

1162
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:10.230
<v Speaker 1>And so I am deregulated in fact by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So called regulation.</v>

1163
00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Basically you would say it's the risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to take to be free,</v>

1164
00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:14.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that in other words,</v>

1165
00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:17.780
<v Speaker 2>that if you're an electrician and I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody come into my kitchen,</v>

1166
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:19.940
<v Speaker 2>we had a little light thing the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day now.</v>

1167
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who was licensed,</v>

1168
00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:21.944
<v Speaker 2>I guess because it's got to be licensed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're saying it's just the risk </v>

1169
00:53:24.021 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>that you have to take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He</v>

1170
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.530
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to come in here and burn my</v>
<v Speaker 1>house down,</v>

1171
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 1>nor do you want him to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1172
00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.680
<v Speaker 1>This is another unintended consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of so,</v>

1173
00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:38.910
<v Speaker 1>so called government regulation in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if people come to depend on it too much,</v>

1174
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:42.060
<v Speaker 1>they just assume whoever you call up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call up and say,</v>

1175
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:42.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1176
00:53:42.671 --> 00:53:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I need some electrical work done in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1177
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.003
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a state where electricians </v>

1178
00:53:47.241 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 1>are regulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this guy must be okay.</v>

1179
00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1180
00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:51.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not,</v>

1181
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.990
<v Speaker 1>but if you knew that was up to you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>check,</v>

1182
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:56.243
<v Speaker 1>first of all the market supplies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these wonderful ways of verifying a </v>

1183
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:01.740
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

1184
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.520
<v Speaker 1>if anyone was free to practice being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrician,</v>

1185
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:07.770
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have easy access.</v>

1186
00:54:07.771 --> 00:54:08.604
<v Speaker 1>You as a consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have easy access to various </v>

1187
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1188
00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:12.150
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1189
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:16.730
<v Speaker 1>to rank various electricians by how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in a video and all the apps.</v>

1190
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1191
00:54:17.641 --> 00:54:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1192
00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:18.830
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1193
00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:19.663
<v Speaker 1>it's a total myth to think that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government is more concerned about our </v>

1194
00:54:24.781 --> 00:54:25.614
<v Speaker 1>welfare and our property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we are who's more concerned about </v>

1195
00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:31.470
<v Speaker 1>your house than you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's more concerned about your personal</v>

1196
00:54:31.471 --> 00:54:34.700
<v Speaker 1>safety and health?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you are a.</v>

1197
00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:35.693
<v Speaker 1>The government might pretend that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more concerned or that it's somehow has </v>

1198
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.360
<v Speaker 1>deeper insight to what is best for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't buy it.</v>

1199
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1200
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I think young children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1201
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.193
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know their interest as well </v>

1202
00:54:48.601 --> 00:54:50.880
<v Speaker 1>as their parents do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you become an adult,</v>

1203
00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:55.110
<v Speaker 1>the presumption must be that each of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an adult cares for and knows our best</v>

1204
00:54:55.111 --> 00:54:55.944
<v Speaker 1>interests much better than any third </v>
<v Speaker 1>party does reminded of something else </v>

1205
00:54:58.051 --> 00:54:58.884
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe I got too many of my old </v>

1206
00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:00.864
<v Speaker 1>economic theories from the simpsons </v>
<v Speaker 1>because do you remember that episode </v>

1207
00:55:03.791 --> 00:55:08.370
<v Speaker 1>knew very early on with Mr Burns at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power plant and he's leaking,</v>

1208
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear waste into the river and they </v>

1209
00:55:10.801 --> 00:55:14.310
<v Speaker 1>get a three eyed fish and the whole idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

1210
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:16.410
<v Speaker 1>if you just let business do what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants,</v>

1211
00:55:16.411 --> 00:55:17.244
<v Speaker 1>it's going to pollute the river and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be eating three eyed </v>

1212
00:55:18.571 --> 00:55:19.140
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

1213
00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.810
<v Speaker 1>But that's completely the reverse of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you've said.</v>

1214
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:22.470
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1215
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:23.303
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an economist would say to that as </v>

1216
00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:24.721
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1217
00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:27.150
<v Speaker 1>there are some areas where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1218
00:55:27.151 --> 00:55:32.151
<v Speaker 1>your actions as a private citizen spill </v>
<v Speaker 1>over onto a innocent third party so they</v>

1219
00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:34.434
<v Speaker 1>have no input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So reasonable people can disagree about </v>

1220
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:39.930
<v Speaker 1>the proper role of government in </v>
<v Speaker 1>preventing pollution or,</v>

1221
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>or preventing third party effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so much regulation has nothing to do</v>

1222
00:55:43.981 --> 00:55:45.900
<v Speaker 1>with third party effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's simply to say,</v>

1223
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get your hair braided a,</v>

1224
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.280
<v Speaker 1>you have to go to one of these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we approve,</v>

1225
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:52.560
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to go to that person </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there,</v>

1226
00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:53.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1227
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.140
<v Speaker 1>who does not yet have our approval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1228
00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:59.940
<v Speaker 1>there's no third party effect here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a surprising amount of regulation is</v>

1229
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:01.510
<v Speaker 1>of that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:56:01.511 --> 00:56:02.344
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I bought this house and </v>

1231
00:56:03.031 --> 00:56:03.864
<v Speaker 1>you have to have all the people come by </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the inspectors and everything and </v>

1232
00:56:05.911 --> 00:56:09.360
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for these little absurd </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I'm talking with the builder</v>

1233
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1234
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.570
<v Speaker 1>this has to be an inch this way over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and blah blah blah.</v>

1235
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:15.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no answer for it.</v>

1236
00:56:15.301 --> 00:56:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of times I say,</v>

1237
00:56:16.331 --> 00:56:20.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that regulation to regulate?</v>

1238
00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.920
<v Speaker 1>That's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone in Sacramento's said this is how</v>

1239
00:56:23.921 --> 00:56:26.360
<v Speaker 1>it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's how it is and everybody,</v>

1240
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.233
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another problem with government </v>

1241
00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:29.224
<v Speaker 1>regulation is that it's one size fits </v>
<v Speaker 1>all and I don't care how smart you are </v>

1242
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.200
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1243
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:37.163
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much experience you have in the </v>

1244
00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:42.530
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in our highly dynamic,</v>

1245
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:45.220
<v Speaker 1>in our highly dynamic economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are always changing.</v>

1246
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Different people have different risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerances.</v>

1247
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:49.923
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of my least favorite regulators </v>

1248
00:56:52.091 --> 00:56:53.780
<v Speaker 1>is the FDA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1249
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:56.170
<v Speaker 1>there are very few third party effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the FDA.</v>

1250
00:56:56.171 --> 00:56:57.004
<v Speaker 1>The FDA is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drug regulation affects you and it </v>

1251
00:57:01.661 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 1>prevents you in consultation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you choose with your doctor.</v>

1252
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:05.644
<v Speaker 1>And most sensible people would consult </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a physician from choosing what </v>

1253
00:57:08.771 --> 00:57:12.160
<v Speaker 1>level of risks you are able to subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to in order to relieve yourself</v>

1254
00:57:12.161 --> 00:57:13.160
<v Speaker 1>of pain or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1255
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.530
<v Speaker 1>to fend off imminent death.</v>

1256
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that any bureaucrats </v>
<v Speaker 1>business but yours.</v>

1257
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.330
<v Speaker 1>You may make a decision different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently than I do,</v>

1258
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:24.700
<v Speaker 1>but so what we all have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>tastes.</v>

1259
00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:26.160
<v Speaker 1>We all have different preferences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences,</v>

1260
00:57:26.161 --> 00:57:26.994
<v Speaker 1>we all have different tolerances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that it's the </v>

1261
00:57:28.361 --> 00:57:29.710
<v Speaker 1>government's position to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1262
00:57:29.711 --> 00:57:30.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1263
00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.173
<v Speaker 1>Your preference for risk is too great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to let you take this </v>

1264
00:57:33.911 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 1>experimental drug because we think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>might hurt you.</v>

1265
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that's the government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>business at all at your business.</v>

1266
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:41.853
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you better get as educated as </v>

1267
00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:43.751
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1268
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:45.570
<v Speaker 1>this is where I would say it comes down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to education and,</v>

1269
00:57:45.571 --> 00:57:46.060
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1270
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.300
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who has a better incentive to become</v>

1271
00:57:49.301 --> 00:57:50.890
<v Speaker 1>informed and educated on the matter then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1272
00:57:50.891 --> 00:57:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it's your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.291
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1274
00:57:53.291 --> 00:57:54.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1275
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:54.821
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1276
00:57:54.821 --> 00:57:55.780
<v Speaker 1>you can tell stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1277
00:57:55.781 --> 00:57:57.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you won't,</v>

1278
00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.660
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell stories too.</v>

1279
00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:59.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that this bureaucrat </v>

1280
00:58:00.251 --> 00:58:01.084
<v Speaker 1>over here is going to do as good a job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to bet that you are much </v>

1281
00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:05.410
<v Speaker 1>less likely to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

1282
00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:06.533
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1283
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:10.430
<v Speaker 1>a less careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1284
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.240
<v Speaker 1>With your life than this guy or gal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your life.</v>

1285
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:14.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1286
00:58:14.021 --> 00:58:14.854
<v Speaker 1>So since you said it was a long game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know how much high Eq has </v>

1287
00:58:16.721 --> 00:58:19.060
<v Speaker 1>influenced you and you right at cafe </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] dot com.</v>

1288
00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:20.763
<v Speaker 1>Let's do what are the ideas of how got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we've actually explored a lot of </v>

1289
00:58:22.661 --> 00:58:24.550
<v Speaker 1>them here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there was something that,</v>

1290
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.413
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you before that a lot of my </v>

1291
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:27.040
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go out and they,</v>

1292
00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:29.770
<v Speaker 1>they get books after and they start </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading on all of this.</v>

1293
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:33.550
<v Speaker 1>What are some of the ideas of high that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to impart?</v>

1294
00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:40.820
<v Speaker 1>That society is vastly more complex than</v>
<v Speaker 1>we understand it to be particularly a,</v>

1295
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:45.610
<v Speaker 1>a market oriented global society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1296
00:58:45.611 --> 00:58:48.220
<v Speaker 1>we talk about it in vague terms about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the labor market,</v>

1297
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.680
<v Speaker 1>the amount of trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1298
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the GDP numbers,</v>

1299
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:59.190
<v Speaker 1>all these terms and numbers mask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous underlying complexities.</v>

1300
00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:05.790
<v Speaker 1>All the action that makes our society </v>
<v Speaker 1>work is done at the local level.</v>

1301
00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:07.721
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

1302
00:59:07.721 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a core hierarchy and insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you start acting at this,</v>

1303
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 1>at the higher level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the risk is that,</v>

1304
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:18.770
<v Speaker 1>that you will stamp out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

1305
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.863
<v Speaker 1>you'll see a stomp out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll smother these individual </v>

1306
00:59:24.921 --> 00:59:27.500
<v Speaker 1>adjustments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the local level that actually bob,</v>

1307
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.650
<v Speaker 1>whose consequences bubble up to the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it all work.</v>

1308
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:33.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a great hire he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not the most quotable of,</v>

1309
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:36.590
<v Speaker 1>of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a great hire quotation.</v>

1310
00:59:36.591 --> 00:59:37.424
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get it exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it goes something like the curious </v>

1311
00:59:40.581 --> 00:59:43.860
<v Speaker 1>task of the economist is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1312
00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:44.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remind me again of how little they know </v>

1313
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:51.170
<v Speaker 1>about what they imagine they can create.</v>

1314
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.921
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1315
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:52.754
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can imagine Bernie Sanders imagines </v>

1316
00:59:54.191 --> 00:59:55.024
<v Speaker 1>he can create a world of everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets paid at least $15 an </v>

1317
00:59:57.321 --> 00:59:59.930
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other people imagine they can create</v>

1318
00:59:59.931 --> 01:00:04.931
<v Speaker 1>a world in which in which no one is dies</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of a drug overdose.</v>

1319
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1320
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.610
<v Speaker 1>you can create that world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's far too complex and that's the,</v>

1321
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.430
<v Speaker 1>that's the critical hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And inside the world's really complex.</v>

1322
01:00:13.431 --> 01:00:14.264
<v Speaker 1>And therefore for truly complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to devolve decision making </v>

1323
01:00:15.891 --> 01:00:16.724
<v Speaker 1>authority down to the lowest possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>level and not have people who are </v>

1324
01:00:20.391 --> 01:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>slathered in Hubris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1325
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making decisions for those of us on the </v>

1326
01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On that note,</v>

1327
01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I think you're an excellent communicator</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those ideas.</v>

1328
01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1329
01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:35.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's reciprocated that very much.</v>
