1
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.893
<v Speaker 1>In so all of you in the good old us of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>have missed the turkeys running around </v>

2
00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:09.214
<v Speaker 1>for dear life this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tomorrow is Thanksgiving without even a </v>

3
00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:12.964
<v Speaker 1>close second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanksgiving is by far my favorite </v>

4
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:18.070
<v Speaker 1>holiday of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that focusing on the three F's,</v>

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.300
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

6
00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>and food usually brings out the best in </v>
<v Speaker 1>just about everybody between the trip to</v>

7
00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>fan from the Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your booze of choice and football in the</v>

8
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of us,</v>

9
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:29.104
<v Speaker 1>at least in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just a little bit better on this </v>

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.510
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we've set aside to give thanks for</v>

11
00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 1>all the goodness in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanksgiving is the ultimate reminder of</v>

12
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:40.234
<v Speaker 1>what it means to be American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While most of us have the usual staples </v>

13
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 1>of Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mashed potatoes,</v>

14
00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 1>stuffing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cranberry sauce around the table.</v>

15
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.960
<v Speaker 1>We also bring in traditions from our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>

16
00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>ethnicities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nationalities.</v>

17
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.490
<v Speaker 1>This blending of flavors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

18
00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:55.324
<v Speaker 1>and customs from all over the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes Thanksgiving a uniquely </v>

19
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 1>American holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No offense to Canadian thanksgiving.</v>

20
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.113
<v Speaker 1>The melting pot that we've created here </v>
<v Speaker 1>has given more freedom to more people </v>

21
00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:08.314
<v Speaker 1>for more walks of life than any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>country in the history of the world </v>

22
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People still yearning to come to America</v>

23
00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:18.520
<v Speaker 1>to take part in our freedom and pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much nobody wants to leave America.</v>

24
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>No matter how often celebrities say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will.</v>

25
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean we're perfect or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere close to it,</v>

26
00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:25.054
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean that our tradition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom based on and rooted in the </v>

27
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>

28
00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:31.414
<v Speaker 1>and happiness is a pretty good starting </v>
<v Speaker 1>point for how to build a truly liberal </v>

29
00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:36.604
<v Speaker 1>and tolerant society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While politics will undoubtedly be </v>

30
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>discussed around the Thanksgiving table </v>
<v Speaker 1>this year,</v>

31
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.893
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do my best to try to veer </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation always to what brings </v>

32
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.870
<v Speaker 1>us together rather than what rips us </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

33
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your uncle is pro life and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pro choice.</v>

34
00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your sister voted for Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you voted for trump.</v>

35
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you want low taxes and your dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to redistribute wealth.</v>

36
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.473
<v Speaker 1>Whatever those differences are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are actually the very reason that </v>

37
00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:06.214
<v Speaker 1>this country is so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all get to have our own opinion and </v>

38
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:10.204
<v Speaker 1>fight for what we believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but beyond just the ability to be </v>

39
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:15.070
<v Speaker 1>tolerant of people who are different </v>
<v Speaker 1>from us.</v>

40
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.173
<v Speaker 1>It's more important that we can still </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from live with and even love </v>

41
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.153
<v Speaker 1>people who think differently than we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you have a wonderful day </v>

42
00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:25.174
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with those three f's I mentioned </v>

43
00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

44
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:31.780
<v Speaker 1>family and food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe one more f if you get lucky.</v>

45
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.123
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's give thanks tomorrow for all the </v>

46
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:35.644
<v Speaker 1>goodness we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often forget to even acknowledge </v>

47
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 1>happy Thanksgiving to you and all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved ones.</v>

48
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is the creator of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dilbert Comic Strip,</v>

49
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.463
<v Speaker 1>author of the new book win bigly and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who seems to make some pretty spot </v>

50
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 1>on predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott Adams,</v>

51
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>welcome back to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for me.</v>

52
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Before</v>

53
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.130
<v Speaker 2>we begin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotTa Tell Ya,</v>

54
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at these blurbs on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back of this book.</v>

55
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 2>How did you get these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>William Shakespeare,</v>

56
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Mark Twain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexander the Great Abe Lincoln,</v>

57
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 2>and even this Scott Adams guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

58
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:14.344
<v Speaker 2>how in the world did you pull this off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stick with dead people because they </v>

59
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:19.220
<v Speaker 2>can't complain later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

60
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not one of them has complained that I've</v>

61
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 2>misquoted them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know Mark Twain,</v>

62
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 2>he said nothing about his quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>

63
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:26.224
<v Speaker 2>I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought immediately there must be an </v>

64
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 2>estate for some of these people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitor these types of things.</v>

65
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Do you even have to think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does the editor or the publisher goes,</v>

66
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't play in.</v>

67
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

68
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 2>luckily my job is parody and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I know those laws pretty well.</v>

69
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 2>As long as it's obvious parody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do anything you want.</v>

70
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 2>So we checked right before you walked </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

71
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 2>We had you on the show September,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of 2016,</v>

72
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 2>about two months before the election and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I had you on,</v>

73
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:55.684
<v Speaker 2>you were one of the only people that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought basically was making sense of </v>

74
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 2>what was going on with trump at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

75
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 2>You didn't say you were a trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporter.</v>

76
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I think you actually said you were not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump supporter.</v>

77
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 2>You had sort of said the thing about you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in a hostage situation with Hillary,</v>

78
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:10.924
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically you were saying here's what </v>

79
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 2>trump is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily support it.</v>

80
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I think you buy the election time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You officially did support him,</v>

81
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 2>The because of one issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically when,</v>

83
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 2>when Clinton came out with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

84
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:24.454
<v Speaker 2>the estate tax plan and I realized that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally would pay roughly seventy </v>

85
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 2>five cents on every dollar I would learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the rest of my life,</v>

86
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 2>which would basically make me retire.</v>

87
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't possibly work for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

88
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that changed my mind.</v>

89
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't going to jump into the estate </v>

90
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:41.044
<v Speaker 2>tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do find it when one of the </v>

91
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:42.634
<v Speaker 2>interesting things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't stand to make a windfall from </v>

92
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:45.604
<v Speaker 2>the estate tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find it one of those things where </v>

93
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:47.464
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this money has been taxed for someone's </v>

94
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:50.194
<v Speaker 2>entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your money that you earned through all </v>

95
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 2>your hard work has been taxed your whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

96
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully you've made good investments </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever else you've done.</v>

97
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I met at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government just says,</v>

98
00:04:58.301 --> 00:04:59.134
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to just basically take more </v>

99
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 2>than half of it at that point after </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've already taken it the whole time,</v>

100
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.743
<v Speaker 2>the whole tax thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to make it fair because </v>

101
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 2>there's always somebody who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>complain,</v>

102
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.543
<v Speaker 2>but some things just feel less fair and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that feels more like confiscation than </v>

103
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.360
<v Speaker 2>tax.</v>

104
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I guess it's easy to be one of those</v>

105
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 2>people that just are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

106
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not involved in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't stand to win anything of it,</v>

107
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>so why wouldn't I want to take the money</v>
<v Speaker 2>from other people?</v>

108
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

109
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the big problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic system.</v>

110
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:29.284
<v Speaker 2>People can vote a vote other people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>money into their pocket if there are </v>

111
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 2>enough of them voting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

112
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a little over a year ago that we</v>

113
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:38.900
<v Speaker 2>had you on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're making some sense of the,</v>

114
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.743
<v Speaker 2>of the techniques that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're writing about in this book </v>

115
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 2>about persuasion and what trump is doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>

116
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Around that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like two months before you actually</v>

117
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.053
<v Speaker 2>did you really think it was real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did really believe that he was going </v>

118
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:57.550
<v Speaker 2>to win those weeks that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and most of the time up to them,</v>

119
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

120
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.663
<v Speaker 2>The only time my confidence was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>shaken was the same time everybody else </v>

121
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 2>was after the access Hollywood pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pussy gay thing dropped.</v>

122
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody thought that day </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he could get out of that.</v>

123
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard of one person who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

124
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 2>that that didn't bother me at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just amazing.</v>

125
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 2>There was so much news that that whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle and so much more came after that.</v>

126
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.173
<v Speaker 2>That even something that large didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the impact it would have had </v>

127
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 2>because it got lost and you know the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

128
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.670
<v Speaker 2>the enormity of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

129
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 2>What does that tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally about truth right now.</v>

130
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Now the subtitle of your book is </v>
<v Speaker 2>persuasion.</v>

131
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:36.104
<v Speaker 2>In a world where facts don't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facts and truth have a little something </v>

132
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:39.944
<v Speaker 2>to do with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that actually tell you that </v>

133
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:42.374
<v Speaker 2>something like that could happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether you think it was </v>

134
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:47.860
<v Speaker 2>just something he said or locker room </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk or all that nonsense,</v>

135
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 2>but that things don't stick in a way.</v>

136
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 2>They used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

137
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:52.694
<v Speaker 2>let me give some context for people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are new to me in addition to cartooning </v>

138
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:57.570
<v Speaker 2>and writing and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

139
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.413
<v Speaker 2>I'm a trained hypnotist and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>studying persuasion in all its forms </v>

140
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for decades.</v>

141
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.883
<v Speaker 2>So I was looking at it through that </v>
<v Speaker 2>filter and one of the things that </v>

142
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:06.854
<v Speaker 2>hypnotist learned is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrational pretty much all the time and </v>

143
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:11.534
<v Speaker 2>they just rationalize their decisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and believed that it made sense all </v>

144
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the normal way of things.</v>

145
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Until you get into that mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole world looks confusing.</v>

146
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.973
<v Speaker 2>You can't understand why you gave you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good reasons and your facts and your </v>

147
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 2>logic and the person you're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't change their mind.</v>

148
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:29.803
<v Speaker 2>So my view on the election was that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly by the time that the access </v>

149
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood tape dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably almost every mind was made up.</v>

150
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.983
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had made up their minds for </v>

151
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 2>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irrational,</v>

152
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 2>whatever reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's tough to dislodge somebody,</v>

153
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have had to murder somebody in </v>

154
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:50.864
<v Speaker 2>public to change minds at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that late stage because people were </v>

155
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 2>really hardened in their opinions by </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

156
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that tell you?</v>

157
00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:58.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we're taping this,</v>

158
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 2>this will be up next week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a little right before thanksgiving.</v>

159
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.110
<v Speaker 2>We're taping this on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today's the eighth today.</v>

160
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Does that sound right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

161
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:07.820
<v Speaker 2>That sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a pro.</v>

162
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that tell you as I'm watching </v>

163
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:12.510
<v Speaker 2>all these people on twitter in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>day or so with this,</v>

164
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.383
<v Speaker 2>thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Hashtag and all this stuff and </v>

165
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 2>this continued worship of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though by every estimation,</v>

166
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:23.140
<v Speaker 2>she probably was the worst candidate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of American politics.</v>

167
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 2>That might be a bit of an overblown </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement,</v>

168
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 2>but what does that day that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>still on this,</v>

169
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 2>there's still on this thing that both </v>
<v Speaker 2>rumble but consider that a statement.</v>

170
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:32.683
<v Speaker 2>We consider it now a given that she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the worst candidates we've ever </v>

171
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 2>seen prior to the election and really </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe up right up until election day.</v>

172
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.823
<v Speaker 2>The general thought on both sides was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the strongest candidates </v>

173
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:50.000
<v Speaker 2>we've ever seen for everything from </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding to experience too.</v>

174
00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 2>It was time for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a woman.</v>

175
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 2>People were emotionally and every other </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

176
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 2>The world was for that,</v>

177
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.620
<v Speaker 3>so it's only after the fact that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>now reinterpreted what we saw as well as</v>

178
00:09:00.621 --> 00:09:01.454
<v Speaker 3>she was the worst candidate ever and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know if either one of those is </v>

179
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:04.734
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we had two candidates who had </v>

180
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 3>some real big pluses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had lots of pluses and some real big</v>

181
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 3>flaws in both cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

182
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that basically trump from </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the election,</v>

183
00:09:17.501 --> 00:09:20.980
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so during the process until now,</v>

184
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.323
<v Speaker 1>after a year of governing basically or </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 months or so of governing has </v>

185
00:09:25.091 --> 00:09:27.580
<v Speaker 1>basically used this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he didn't have it,</v>

186
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.110
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like has he,</v>

187
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.080
<v Speaker 1>is this really what he has done from </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat one that you saw before?</v>

188
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.933
<v Speaker 3>So you have to understand his entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>life arc starts with going to a church </v>

189
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.730
<v Speaker 3>where his pastor was Norman Vincent </v>
<v Speaker 3>Peale,</v>

190
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.360
<v Speaker 3>the famous author who wrote the power of</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive thinking,</v>

191
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:48.853
<v Speaker 3>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the first place you probably </v>

192
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:51.134
<v Speaker 3>learned persuasion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least one corner of persuasion </v>

193
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.493
<v Speaker 3>because in his time Norman Vincent Peale</v>
<v Speaker 3>was actually accused of being a </v>

194
00:09:56.781 --> 00:09:58.670
<v Speaker 3>hypnotist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was that influential.</v>

195
00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:59.803
<v Speaker 3>So that optimism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see him using it all the time to </v>

196
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:05.300
<v Speaker 3>make us think into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he talks about the GDP,</v>

197
00:10:05.301 --> 00:10:06.500
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

198
00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:08.150
<v Speaker 3>we've got three percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty good.</v>

199
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.280
<v Speaker 3>That's what a normal president would </v>
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>

200
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.530
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got three percent,</v>

201
00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:14.720
<v Speaker 3>but without the hurricanes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would have been for.</v>

202
00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:16.910
<v Speaker 3>We've probably got four percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we'll do better than that.</v>

203
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.420
<v Speaker 3>He was actually talking us into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future and if you,</v>

204
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:25.040
<v Speaker 3>if you consider how an economy works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you have shortages of stuff,</v>

205
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.450
<v Speaker 3>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're really,</v>

206
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.343
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a great time because we don't have </v>

207
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:29.780
<v Speaker 3>shortages of anything.</v>

208
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.830
<v Speaker 3>It's psychology that drives it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if people think we're heading to four</v>

209
00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:34.664
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to invest a little bit </v>

210
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:39.680
<v Speaker 3>more this year to get ready for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what makes it four percent.</v>

211
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.640
<v Speaker 3>He's actually taking what he learned as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a child and you know,</v>

212
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.730
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that persuasive thinking into the future</v>

213
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.820
<v Speaker 3>of driving the economy that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you look at his full,</v>

214
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.450
<v Speaker 3>full range of he knows how to sell </v>
<v Speaker 3>marketing,</v>

215
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.613
<v Speaker 3>branding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody doubts any of those skills at </v>

216
00:10:56.151 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 3>this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

217
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.900
<v Speaker 3>and then negotiating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wrote literally,</v>

218
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:01.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>authored with a coauthor,</v>

219
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.630
<v Speaker 3>a book on negotiating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's seen persuasion from every,</v>

220
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.480
<v Speaker 3>every angle including design,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

221
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.533
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the one who I believe came up with </v>

222
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:14.360
<v Speaker 3>or at least approved the hats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make America great again.</v>

223
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.583
<v Speaker 3>And I think people will look back at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this for 40 years and say that was the </v>

224
00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:22.460
<v Speaker 3>best branding we've ever seen.</v>

225
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to me because you said </v>

226
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.240
<v Speaker 1>the positive way he speaks and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave some examples.</v>

227
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.390
<v Speaker 1>But if you listen to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the general narrative out there,</v>

228
00:11:31.391 --> 00:11:33.530
<v Speaker 1>this is the most divisive president at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

229
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.610
<v Speaker 1>He says all these horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of that portion of him,</v>

230
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.553
<v Speaker 1>the twitter portion that's fighting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people still all the time doing things </v>

231
00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:42.334
<v Speaker 1>that in my opinion are below the office </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the presidency and I say that as </v>

232
00:11:45.551 --> 00:11:48.970
<v Speaker 1>someone that that I really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I wasn't surprised when trump</v>

233
00:11:48.971 --> 00:11:49.804
<v Speaker 1>won was because I actually sat down with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you right before and I listened and I </v>

234
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>started seeing</v>

235
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 2>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I wasn't thoroughly.</v>

236
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 2>I was on Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan the day before the election,</v>

237
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.720
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it was election day actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

238
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible.</v>

239
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 2>And did I actually change your mind on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

240
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.303
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that you can fully changed </v>

241
00:12:07.651 --> 00:12:08.484
<v Speaker 2>my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you made me aware of what was </v>

242
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think basically before I sat down with</v>

243
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:13.204
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sort of where I think a lot of </v>

244
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:14.974
<v Speaker 2>people still are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is they're just grabbing for </v>

245
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:17.590
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

246
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:18.424
<v Speaker 2>Like they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have nothing that they're really </v>

247
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 2>basing any decisions on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see the tweets,</v>

248
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:24.460
<v Speaker 2>they scream about the tweets or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even have a chance to scream about</v>

249
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 2>the tweets because the media gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>outraged before they can even process it</v>

250
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.243
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you sort of framed it in a way that </v>

251
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.270
<v Speaker 2>basically said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something sensible about this is</v>

252
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 2>what I think most people have kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>missed that.</v>

253
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:36.843
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that is deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>important for persuasion is first you </v>

254
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:45.391
<v Speaker 2>have to get people's attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like phase one at this point can,</v>

255
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.200
<v Speaker 2>can anybody argue that he's the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've ever seen at getting attention,</v>

256
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that one.</v>

257
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Even his biggest haters and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

258
00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I like the way he has dominated the </v>
<v Speaker 2>media and every conversation,</v>

259
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:57.304
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so step out and get attention and the </v>

260
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:02.290
<v Speaker 2>way he does that is he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He operates in what I call a narrow band</v>

261
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:03.124
<v Speaker 2>of wrongness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that if this is appropriate </v>

262
00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:05.974
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just takes it up to this band with </v>

263
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Speaker 2>the nicknames and the provocative things</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

264
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.780
<v Speaker 2>but he never does up here where you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>get impeached.</v>

265
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.020
<v Speaker 2>You'd be putting in the insane asylum </v>
<v Speaker 2>and start a nuclear war.</v>

266
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.440
<v Speaker 2>If you look how long he's been doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and how,</v>

267
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:21.274
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how consistently stays in that narrow </v>

268
00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:23.884
<v Speaker 2>band of wrongness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is persuasion perfection because </v>

269
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 2>you can't look away and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about why he wants you to think</v>

270
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:34.780
<v Speaker 2>about now consider also that he's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>been meeting with a lot of world leaders</v>

271
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:35.614
<v Speaker 2>at this point.</v>

272
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.633
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't do that in that context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's clear that he can modify his </v>

273
00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:44.980
<v Speaker 2>behavior to get the effect he needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know that for sure.</v>

274
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll say other people didn't know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

275
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.113
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was running it looked a little </v>

276
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:50.134
<v Speaker 2>crazy and maybe under control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now we've seen the fine control he </v>

277
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:54.210
<v Speaker 2>puts on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.053
<v Speaker 2>on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that narrow band that wrongness every </v>

279
00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:57.574
<v Speaker 2>time in real life you can modulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything being equal as a smart guy </v>

280
00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:03.214
<v Speaker 2>and a bright guy and an author and </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that cares about words and all </v>

281
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 2>of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putting trump aside for a moment,</v>

282
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.233
<v Speaker 2>would you prefer that we just had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>president that was a little more within </v>

283
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:19.870
<v Speaker 2>the common standards of decency or seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>to really appreciate.</v>

284
00:14:19.871 --> 00:14:20.704
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep telling this story that I was in </v>

285
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:22.930
<v Speaker 2>DC a couple weeks ago and I went to all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the monuments.</v>

286
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I was reading all the great things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson wrote in George Washington all</v>

287
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:27.723
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very different than when they look </v>

288
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 2>back and they put trump's tweet next to </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

289
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have mixed feelings for one lot.</v>

290
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that the people on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

291
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:38.950
<v Speaker 2>let's say the the anti trumpers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever they are,</v>

292
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 2>don't get is how entertaining he is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>his base.</v>

293
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.063
<v Speaker 2>The people who actually like what he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to offer find it amazingly </v>

294
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 2>entertaining and funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the things that people are saying,</v>

295
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you said that.</v>

296
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:58.310
<v Speaker 2>These using a front to all civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's funny.</v>

297
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.950
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because we know he does it </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally.</v>

298
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.173
<v Speaker 2>We know the effect it'll have on a of </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of people and that's sort of the </v>

299
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 2>joke that it has that effect that as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your question,</v>

300
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.890
<v Speaker 2>we were never offered somebody who had </v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

301
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:13.843
<v Speaker 2>his talents and his specific policies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that appealed to a lot of people who </v>

302
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 2>voted for him without the flaws.</v>

303
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 2>You're nobody offered the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

304
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 2>the trump without the tweets that make </v>
<v Speaker 2>people angry.</v>

305
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.193
<v Speaker 2>And I would argue that probably 80 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the things that feel like </v>

306
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:31.754
<v Speaker 2>they're over the live actually are </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional and the 20 percent then </v>

307
00:15:35.341 --> 00:15:36.174
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

308
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.030
<v Speaker 2>how do you mean functional gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

309
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.983
<v Speaker 2>That puts a nickname on somebody that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually takes them completely out of </v>

310
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:42.704
<v Speaker 2>the primaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw that with low energy jeb and I </v>

311
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:48.080
<v Speaker 2>think the crooked hillary thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was quite effective.</v>

312
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.200
<v Speaker 2>But there are other things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe just too far,</v>

313
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little they don't have.</v>

314
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.883
<v Speaker 2>They're not so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets impeached but they're not </v>

315
00:15:56.511 --> 00:15:58.130
<v Speaker 2>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

316
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.680
<v Speaker 2>but they also don't seem to hurt him in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the long run.</v>

317
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Speaker 2>We've seen something we may never see </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

318
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.120
<v Speaker 2>which is a complete disconnect between </v>
<v Speaker 2>approval ratings,</v>

319
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Speaker 2>which are terrible and people's image of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the economy is doing.</v>

320
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.440
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>business confidence is great.</v>

321
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we'll ever see those </v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnect again and it's because of his</v>

322
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:21.740
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that also show you that people just</v>

323
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 2>don't care about Paul's anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

324
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I saw Paul on Sunday on CNN and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

325
00:16:25.581 --> 00:16:27.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of Americans don't trust trump,</v>

326
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:27.861
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

327
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 2>half of Americans don't trust CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of the.</v>

328
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.573
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you guys through all these </v>

329
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:33.194
<v Speaker 2>numbers at us before you through all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this nonsense at us before and now </v>

330
00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you're still throwing nonsense and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't try.</v>

331
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I really almost trust none of it and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it harder to,</v>

332
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.790
<v Speaker 2>to siphon some truth out and now the </v>
<v Speaker 2>onus is on a.</v>

333
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I was just saying a pole that was saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that something about,</v>

334
00:16:51.391 --> 00:16:52.224
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think the leaders think of the </v>

335
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:54.584
<v Speaker 2>president and I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we know what leaders of other </v>

336
00:16:56.961 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 2>countries think of the president?</v>

337
00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.130
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what good is that?</v>

338
00:16:59.131 --> 00:17:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

339
00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:01.130
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a little while.</v>

340
00:17:01.131 --> 00:17:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Is that even relevant in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an odd way,</v>

341
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if they fear us,</v>

342
00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:06.034
<v Speaker 2>certain countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want them to fear so they probably </v>

343
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:08.204
<v Speaker 2>won't like the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's trump or obama or anyone </v>

344
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:10.341
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

345
00:17:10.341 --> 00:17:13.490
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the big things that scared people</v>

346
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.324
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

347
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.770
<v Speaker 2>a president and trump was that our other</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders going to deal with this guy,</v>

348
00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:19.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

349
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.030
<v Speaker 2>are they going to be frightened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will they make you know the nucleus just</v>

350
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:25.760
<v Speaker 2>in case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem so far.</v>

351
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.833
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that if you're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of the United States and you </v>

352
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Speaker 2>have good table manners when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talked to other leaders,</v>

353
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.003
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that they would rather </v>

354
00:17:35.301 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 2>do than deal with you because it's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their best interest and it works.</v>

355
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.243
<v Speaker 2>So I listened to you on Sam Harris' </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast and Sam obviously been here a </v>

356
00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:44.924
<v Speaker 2>bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find him to be one of the brightest </v>

357
00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:46.694
<v Speaker 2>and most thoughtful people that I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys obviously differ greatly on </v>

358
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the trump thing,</v>

359
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.303
<v Speaker 2>probably more than anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you hear him make a couple of </v>

360
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:58.380
<v Speaker 2>those arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whichever one you can pick anyone.</v>

361
00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does any of it get to you?</v>

362
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Does any of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

363
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 2>the moral center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just what the,</v>

364
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.303
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If things really escalated with North </v>

365
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pick one out of the bag.</v>

366
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for those who didn't hear my </v>

367
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 2>conversation with Sam on his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

368
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:18.000
<v Speaker 2>I was not addressing the moral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical dimension because I figured that</v>

369
00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 2>people are out on their own for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

370
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.060
<v Speaker 2>my moral center is not much different </v>
<v Speaker 2>than everybody else's.</v>

371
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.290
<v Speaker 2>I have exactly the same preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could do things without lying,</v>

372
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.500
<v Speaker 2>without insulting people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I prefer that,</v>

373
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 2>but nobody gave us that choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

374
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't get that candidate.</v>

375
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.160
<v Speaker 2>We had to lead the choices that we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

376
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was,</v>

377
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.930
<v Speaker 2>there's an illusion that Sam and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreed on the ethical,</v>

378
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:44.640
<v Speaker 2>moral stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

379
00:18:44.641 --> 00:18:47.700
<v Speaker 2>I simply take the position fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

380
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.653
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it really wasn't addressed </v>

381
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.530
<v Speaker 2>specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>

382
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.890
<v Speaker 2>wasn't directly asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm,</v>

383
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I take the position that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a,</v>

384
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.873
<v Speaker 2>if a terrorist was holding your child </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the only way I could save them is </v>

385
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:02.790
<v Speaker 2>lying to the terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will lie to the terrorist to save your</v>

386
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:04.050
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

387
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.913
<v Speaker 2>if you wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that you can claim the </v>

388
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:07.614
<v Speaker 2>moral high ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some situations such as </v>

389
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.610
<v Speaker 2>beating Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

390
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Speaker 2>having a good economy.</v>

391
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:17.280
<v Speaker 2>These are fantastically good things for </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>

392
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.473
<v Speaker 2>If you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the only way you could get there is </v>

393
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Ben's been some truths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

394
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.370
<v Speaker 2>then I'm a little bit more flexible </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>

395
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.690
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think my moral look on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>as any different than anybody else's.</v>

396
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:31.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what about just the concerns that </v>

397
00:19:33.361 --> 00:19:34.194
<v Speaker 2>Sam and others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people that are the real </v>

398
00:19:34.981 --> 00:19:35.850
<v Speaker 2>critics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget,</v>

399
00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:36.684
<v Speaker 2>forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can put them aside because if people </v>

400
00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:39.120
<v Speaker 2>haven't listened to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not boring.</v>

401
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.590
<v Speaker 2>But when you hear people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

402
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.813
<v Speaker 2>trump is so erratic and he's dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with erratic leader in North Korea and </v>

403
00:19:44.671 --> 00:19:45.441
<v Speaker 2>all of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

404
00:19:45.441 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 2>you basically think that that's all just</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing that,</v>

405
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.953
<v Speaker 2>that other higher bar this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that in reality we're still doing </v>

406
00:19:51.791 --> 00:19:52.320
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

407
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.153
<v Speaker 2>we could talk about North Korea </v>
<v Speaker 2>separately because that's really kind </v>

408
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.370
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing like that that's sort of</v>

409
00:19:56.371 --> 00:19:57.630
<v Speaker 2>its own situation.</v>

410
00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.430
<v Speaker 2>And at the moment I think he's handling </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

411
00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

412
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.420
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

413
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.950
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about North Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for,</v>

414
00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:06.813
<v Speaker 2>for however many decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't really had any pro progress </v>

415
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:10.194
<v Speaker 2>because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they promise things and then they don't </v>

416
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:12.534
<v Speaker 2>do them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is probably the first time that </v>

417
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.370
<v Speaker 2>little rocket man shall we call him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

418
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 2>is literally worried that he will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead in the next 30 days.</v>

419
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they've ever had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought before.</v>

420
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's got to help in negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you're thinking,</v>

421
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.720
<v Speaker 2>but that might make him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.060
<v Speaker 2>fire off a nuke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the only way you can be sure</v>

423
00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:33.894
<v Speaker 2>your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now he's only two choices are </v>

424
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.043
<v Speaker 2>dead for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he wants to make that or </v>

425
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 2>worrying about being dead unless he </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to the negotiating table and there</v>

426
00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:44.844
<v Speaker 2>seems to be some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little bit of a hint of a </v>

427
00:20:46.321 --> 00:20:47.960
<v Speaker 2>movement there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

428
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.210
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

429
00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.650
<v Speaker 3>but to your bigger question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about all the other stuff that,</v>

430
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 3>that is problematic if you were to list </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the things that people consider that</v>

431
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:04.070
<v Speaker 3>the criticisms of trump on one column </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then all the things that people,</v>

432
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 3>even his critics would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

433
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:06.274
<v Speaker 3>these things are going well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would find that the things that are </v>

434
00:21:08.651 --> 00:21:13.651
<v Speaker 3>going well or generally real meaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is less isis stocks are up.</v>

435
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.703
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

436
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did,</v>

437
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:19.650
<v Speaker 3>he did appoint justices that least his </v>
<v Speaker 3>side likes,</v>

438
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immigration is down by 50 percent.</v>

439
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:25.300
<v Speaker 3>These are real and measurable things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they matter and they're big.</v>

440
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.780
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the list of things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are criticizing,</v>

441
00:21:28.781 --> 00:21:31.540
<v Speaker 3>it's well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think he might cause a problem.</v>

442
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.033
<v Speaker 3>We think this could go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're concerned that people think about </v>

443
00:21:35.831 --> 00:21:36.664
<v Speaker 3>him this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think that his supporters are more </v>

444
00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:43.190
<v Speaker 3>racist than they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost all of them would,</v>

445
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.090
<v Speaker 3>would be legitimately classified as </v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginary.</v>

446
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Now that's not to say that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't be bad things in the future,</v>

447
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.630
<v Speaker 3>but at the moment they are purely </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagined.</v>

448
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because I was on Sam's </v>

449
00:21:55.021 --> 00:21:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Ama podcasts and we discussed this and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>

450
00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.020
<v Speaker 1>or he brought up the interview with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I said to basically.</v>

451
00:22:01.021 --> 00:22:01.441
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

452
00:22:01.441 --> 00:22:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even vote for the guy I brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>on many of the week before the election.</v>

453
00:22:05.251 --> 00:22:06.084
<v Speaker 1>I had hilary Rosen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a progressive operative basically </v>

454
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.110
<v Speaker 1>to come on and talk about why not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>vote for him,</v>

455
00:22:10.111 --> 00:22:13.890
<v Speaker 1>but then I had people like you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>others on and tried to talk to everybody</v>

456
00:22:13.891 --> 00:22:15.170
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

457
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.103
<v Speaker 1>but I basically said that to say how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much is the things that he's actually </v>

458
00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:20.604
<v Speaker 1>been able to do are basically mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 1>republican things that if any other </v>

459
00:22:23.941 --> 00:22:24.774
<v Speaker 1>republican would have done the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he hasn't been able to do actually </v>

460
00:22:27.391 --> 00:22:28.224
<v Speaker 1>show the strength of our system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't like the his </v>

461
00:22:31.441 --> 00:22:33.270
<v Speaker 1>healthcare plan or the tax plan or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever else,</v>

462
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.163
<v Speaker 1>congress is fighting him and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the government's supposed to work </v>

463
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and the other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tweets and all the other stuff.</v>

464
00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:40.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

465
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.630
<v Speaker 1>that's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just nothing.</v>

466
00:22:42.631 --> 00:22:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just stuff you know no</v>

467
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.370
<v Speaker 3>to take healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

468
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.810
<v Speaker 3>So if you were going to make a criticism</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the president's performance,</v>

469
00:22:48.811 --> 00:22:49.644
<v Speaker 3>healthcare would be at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>list of criticisms and this illustrates </v>

470
00:22:53.431 --> 00:22:55.650
<v Speaker 3>what I call the the two movies on one </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>

471
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.513
<v Speaker 3>We're all looking at the same set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts and we're producing completely </v>

472
00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:02.040
<v Speaker 3>different movies in our minds about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening.</v>

473
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.660
<v Speaker 3>So some people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

474
00:23:03.661 --> 00:23:06.150
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't solved healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a failure,</v>

475
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.170
<v Speaker 3>but my observation is what was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>deadline for that?</v>

476
00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.160
<v Speaker 3>Is there a time you're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>done and that that,</v>

477
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.330
<v Speaker 3>that past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't see the deadline.</v>

478
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.870
<v Speaker 3>What I see as somebody who left the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans go first,</v>

479
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.140
<v Speaker 3>fail hard because they were going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have a plan.</v>

480
00:23:22.141 --> 00:23:22.974
<v Speaker 3>That was gonna be popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scare the left while letting the right </v>

481
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.610
<v Speaker 3>fail as hard as they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then once he do,</v>

482
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:30.211
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

483
00:23:30.211 --> 00:23:35.211
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll talk to the Democrats until </v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets both of them in this situation,</v>

484
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.870
<v Speaker 3>setting the table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he calls it.</v>

485
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.470
<v Speaker 3>He actually has a word for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not accidental.</v>

486
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.453
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your brand is negotiating and you do </v>

487
00:23:43.411 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 3>things that any objective person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>understands</v>

488
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 2>the negotiating recognizes as correct </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>

489
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 2>He's softening up both sides and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to take awhile.</v>

490
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.430
<v Speaker 2>It might take obamacare to fail a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>harder.</v>

491
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.990
<v Speaker 2>It might take the public to see their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their costs going up in obamacare.</v>

492
00:23:59.991 --> 00:24:03.500
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it might be the only way you can get</v>

493
00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 2>these two sides that are on such </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposites somewhere in the middle.</v>

494
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as he failed,</v>

495
00:24:08.271 --> 00:24:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's a process and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the only way it could go.</v>

496
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 2>How much are you concerned at all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people around him.</v>

497
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.610
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things I hear about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the people around in bed for either</v>

498
00:24:19.611 --> 00:24:22.520
<v Speaker 2>certain things aren't staffed right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't here,</v>

499
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.383
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that much of a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because I think the government </v>

500
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:26.390
<v Speaker 2>should be a lot smaller as a general </v>
<v Speaker 2>rule,</v>

501
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:27.860
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but putting that aside,</v>

502
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 2>that people say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

503
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual acumen around him isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>that great.</v>

504
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Like you've got these players around </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

505
00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:36.740
<v Speaker 2>these people that understand a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you're talking about,</v>

506
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.310
<v Speaker 2>but not sort of like a serious group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like intellects around him.</v>

507
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:46.750
<v Speaker 2>In what department does he really need </v>
<v Speaker 2>help in the State Department because the</v>

508
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 2>international stuff looks like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going pretty well.</v>

509
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Does he need help in the economics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like it's going really well.</v>

510
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Does he need more help than general </v>
<v Speaker 2>Maddis to be an isis?</v>

511
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.943
<v Speaker 2>Madison is doing great now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get down to the Department of </v>

512
00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.213
<v Speaker 2>Agriculture and the EPA and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are real arguments you can have </v>

513
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.780
<v Speaker 2>about whether you've got the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>horsepower there and I would,</v>

514
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I would listen to those arguments for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

515
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.143
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of how much is staffed and </v>

516
00:25:16.821 --> 00:25:20.830
<v Speaker 2>whether there's enough staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still waiting for that to matter.</v>

517
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.373
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of goes to that other point of </v>

518
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.020
<v Speaker 2>just the other things.</v>

519
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:24.853
<v Speaker 2>There's some literal things that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and some maybes and could </v>

520
00:25:27.381 --> 00:25:28.214
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever feel like you're stuck sort </v>

521
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 2>of acting as his counsel publicly or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

522
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:32.963
<v Speaker 2>I suddenly felt like I was like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>grilling you on trump and it was in an </v>

523
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:38.540
<v Speaker 2>odd way because we're obviously going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about your book too,</v>

524
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:39.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's all intertwined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

525
00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:40.523
<v Speaker 2>it's funny in my mind it's always about </v>
<v Speaker 2>persuasion and about a more effective </v>

526
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:47.220
<v Speaker 2>way to see the world that does a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

527
00:25:47.221 --> 00:25:48.620
<v Speaker 2>But predicting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

528
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess is now year and a half ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

529
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:56.330
<v Speaker 2>I said that he would do more than change</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and boy is he changed politics.</v>

530
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.613
<v Speaker 2>But I said he would rip a hole in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality to let us look through and see </v>

531
00:26:01.071 --> 00:26:01.904
<v Speaker 2>something completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's done that because didn't you </v>

532
00:26:05.061 --> 00:26:08.140
<v Speaker 2>used to think that facts mattered and </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't use?</v>

533
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 2>You think that if somebody said as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>things as he said,</v>

534
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.160
<v Speaker 2>that the fact checkers said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

535
00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:14.570
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work.</v>

536
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.900
<v Speaker 2>That you couldn't possibly become </v>
<v Speaker 2>president and if you did,</v>

537
00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't possibly have a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>

538
00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 2>You beat Isis and all the other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing.</v>

539
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 2>None of it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you were a trained persuader,</v>

540
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.183
<v Speaker 2>you could see that early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could see that none of that would </v>

541
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:34.580
<v Speaker 2>matter because you could see that his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his persuasive skill was as strong.</v>

542
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to jump into just say one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

543
00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facts do matter to outcomes and all </v>

544
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:42.920
<v Speaker 2>things being equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would love to get the accurate.</v>

545
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.490
<v Speaker 2>But usually</v>

546
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:49.350
<v Speaker 3>when he's a nonfactual he's persuading </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the direction that we would like.</v>

547
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.560
<v Speaker 3>So if he says the number of deaths by </v>
<v Speaker 3>gun in Chicago or a thousand per day,</v>

548
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.610
<v Speaker 3>but it's really 10 per day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we still need to fix that problem.</v>

549
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 3>And he made us focus on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that it wasn't accurate,</v>

550
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.950
<v Speaker 3>didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't.</v>

551
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

552
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.370
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think he knows it and I think it's</v>

553
00:27:08.371 --> 00:27:11.010
<v Speaker 3>conscious and he calls it hyperbole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a name for it.</v>

554
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

555
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Well that was gonna be my follow up </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

556
00:27:13.011 --> 00:27:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he's really conscious of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff?</v>

557
00:27:15.531 --> 00:27:16.364
<v Speaker 1>I would feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would feel better if I really </v>

558
00:27:17.811 --> 00:27:21.230
<v Speaker 1>thought he was conscious of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I knew he was conscious of it,</v>

559
00:27:21.231 --> 00:27:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's kind yet at the same time.</v>

560
00:27:24.081 --> 00:27:27.350
<v Speaker 1>That would mean he intentionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are lies.</v>

561
00:27:27.351 --> 00:27:28.184
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he knows them and he's and he's </v>

562
00:27:29.811 --> 00:27:30.644
<v Speaker 1>intentionally doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's for all the reasons that </v>

563
00:27:32.991 --> 00:27:35.680
<v Speaker 1>you lay out here in the book that still </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage,</v>

564
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.530
<v Speaker 1>then it's an outright lie as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just an exaggeration or hyperbole.</v>

565
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that.</v>

566
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to consider intention?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

567
00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 3>at this point I don't see any scenario </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which the good of the country and how</v>

568
00:27:49.031 --> 00:27:54.031
<v Speaker 3>he does personally are separated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to do a good job for the country.</v>

569
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.660
<v Speaker 3>So if he's telling a lie that's good for</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and bad for the country,</v>

570
00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.020
<v Speaker 3>that's just a fricken lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's in favor of that.</v>

571
00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:03.910
<v Speaker 3>But if he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

572
00:28:03.911 --> 00:28:04.744
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to fight extra hard to fix </v>

573
00:28:06.881 --> 00:28:07.714
<v Speaker 3>this problem that everybody wants fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a little bit of an </v>

574
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.800
<v Speaker 3>exaggeration in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

575
00:28:11.801 --> 00:28:14.080
<v Speaker 3>it's still the direction that we do want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go.</v>

576
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.580
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>

577
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those situations,</v>

578
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:18.603
<v Speaker 3>you can call it a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can call it someone who didn't pass </v>

579
00:28:20.591 --> 00:28:24.130
<v Speaker 3>the fact checking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would call it hyperbole because he's,</v>

580
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.160
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

581
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.120
<v Speaker 3>it's a sort of an exaggerated truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>

582
00:28:28.121 --> 00:28:30.010
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>directionally it's true.</v>

583
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Just the details are wrong.</v>

584
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.740
<v Speaker 1>So as a guy that wrote one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular,</v>

585
00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:37.620
<v Speaker 1>has written one of those popular comic </v>
<v Speaker 1>strips of all time,</v>

586
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.150
<v Speaker 1>the whole purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

587
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.133
<v Speaker 1>I think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of comic strips and stand up and </v>

588
00:28:41.551 --> 00:28:42.384
<v Speaker 1>everything that you're getting to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kernel of truth at the end of that </v>

589
00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:44.401
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

590
00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Like every time you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume,</v>

591
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:46.824
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that fair to say that every time you </v>

592
00:28:47.371 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 1>ever rode a strip that there's a kernel </v>
<v Speaker 1>of truth at the end,</v>

593
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:51.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do it right,</v>

594
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.330
<v Speaker 1>if you do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

595
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.270
<v Speaker 1>So how can you also be the guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that it's okay to live in a facts</v>

596
00:28:57.271 --> 00:29:02.271
<v Speaker 1>still matter place like facts and truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a rope there,</v>

597
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:03.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

598
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.900
<v Speaker 3>I love the US side question because this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just a perfect way to make the point.</v>

599
00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:10.570
<v Speaker 3>The comic strip is an exaggerated world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

600
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:12.780
<v Speaker 3>it's just a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

601
00:29:12.781 --> 00:29:15.390
<v Speaker 3>something that wouldn't actually happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the real world.</v>

602
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.900
<v Speaker 3>But what people say about it is that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like my job.</v>

603
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.333
<v Speaker 3>So they're looking at something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>this crazy world and they're still </v>

604
00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:25.710
<v Speaker 3>seeing the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're a good cartoonist,</v>

605
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:26.603
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've made both of those things happen </v>

606
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.090
<v Speaker 3>that shouldn't be together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

607
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.333
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's a perfect example that I </v>

608
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:36.960
<v Speaker 3>get to see every day where people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just like my office.</v>

609
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.280
<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

610
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Speaker 3>there were no aliens in your office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody had exploded.</v>

611
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 3>That didn't</v>

612
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.890
<v Speaker 2>happen in your office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So stuff in the comics,</v>

613
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.690
<v Speaker 2>people regard as feeling real when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly are not.</v>

614
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with the term K Fab?</v>

615
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.230
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

616
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.460
<v Speaker 2>it's the term that wrestlers use that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

617
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.330
<v Speaker 2>that's the fakery that everyone knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fake.</v>

618
00:29:58.331 --> 00:30:00.310
<v Speaker 2>We all know it's fake were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>

619
00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:01.144
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eliciting real emotions from </v>

620
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 2>people that go there and pay you to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something fake and have a real emotion.</v>

621
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.240
<v Speaker 2>And I think there is some connection </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that and what you're talking about.</v>

622
00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:11.840
<v Speaker 2>And that trump was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

623
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.270
<v Speaker 2>he was a fan of wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

624
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:14.104
<v Speaker 2>there's those clips of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at Wrestlemania and taken out </v>

625
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Vince Mcmahon and the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he is playing that game.</v>

626
00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:24.370
<v Speaker 2>He has merged theater and politics like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's ever done.</v>

627
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.550
<v Speaker 2>And he just happens to be good at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theater stuff.</v>

628
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.310
<v Speaker 2>And so he effectively merge them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

629
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:31.144
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we'll ever see this again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very special situation and </v>

630
00:30:34.671 --> 00:30:36.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I've probably said this before,</v>

631
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.370
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a talent stack of,</v>

632
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:44.250
<v Speaker 2>of individual talents that he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>b plus a minus that.</v>

633
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.530
<v Speaker 2>But there's so many of them and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>work so well together.</v>

634
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.740
<v Speaker 2>All of his persuasion stuff is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His theater stuff is public speaking is,</v>

635
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his intelligence,</v>

636
00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:56.110
<v Speaker 2>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all high,</v>

637
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.760
<v Speaker 2>but you'd say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

638
00:30:57.761 --> 00:30:58.594
<v Speaker 2>we've had smarter presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've had better orators orators or </v>

639
00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:06.790
<v Speaker 2>eight people who speak better than I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>either one way or another.</v>

640
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:08.050
<v Speaker 2>We definitely have those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

641
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:09.993
<v Speaker 2>but very few people have had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination with business experience </v>

642
00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his ability to take criticism.</v>

643
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Even though people say he's thin </v>
<v Speaker 2>skinned,</v>

644
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.210
<v Speaker 2>you don't get into this game unless you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you can handle the criticism.</v>

645
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you think trump derangement syndrome </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a real mental disorder?</v>

646
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:26.194
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm being slightly facetious </v>

647
00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:30.580
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm actually starting to Israel that</v>

648
00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:33.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a real psychological condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

649
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.023
<v Speaker 2>Because I get into these conversations </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time with fans and friends and </v>

650
00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:40.510
<v Speaker 2>family and whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just try.</v>

651
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I try my hardest to take the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational,</v>

652
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:45.940
<v Speaker 2>decent emotion and what actually has </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

653
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:46.923
<v Speaker 2>how you may not like Gorsuch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was just a mainstream can you </v>

654
00:31:51.031 --> 00:31:54.100
<v Speaker 2>know that any mainstream republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have put this guy in.</v>

655
00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Now you may be a Democrat and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>upsetting to you,</v>

656
00:31:56.561 --> 00:31:58.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not Hitler.</v>

657
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.213
<v Speaker 2>Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've really tried to like take </v>

658
00:32:01.421 --> 00:32:03.010
<v Speaker 2>some of the fangs out of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments,</v>

659
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:07.330
<v Speaker 2>but I do find the level that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with this stuff.</v>

660
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:09.130
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In all seriousness,</v>

661
00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:13.540
<v Speaker 2>this is a legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly major mental health issue.</v>

662
00:32:13.541 --> 00:32:14.374
<v Speaker 2>And you hear psychologists are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with people who are coming in </v>

663
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.150
<v Speaker 2>and crying and thinking that the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>has exploded and there's a.</v>

664
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.600
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a good reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the result,</v>

665
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.390
<v Speaker 2>it was a surprise to half of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

666
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:29.523
<v Speaker 2>So the people who were trump supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they weren't sure he was going </v>

667
00:32:32.691 --> 00:32:33.524
<v Speaker 2>to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they got was a world that made </v>

668
00:32:35.231 --> 00:32:38.290
<v Speaker 2>sense to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought all along he should win.</v>

669
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>And then when he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though</v>

670
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.100
<v Speaker 3>it was surprising in the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their world was intact.</v>

671
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Everything that they thought about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world seemed to be about right.</v>

672
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.100
<v Speaker 3>They just thought other people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

673
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 3>But if you are on the side that knew he </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't win,</v>

674
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 3>there's no way you were living in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country that this monster could possibly</v>

675
00:32:56.391 --> 00:33:00.820
<v Speaker 3>become our leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you woke up and he was you.</v>

676
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.693
<v Speaker 3>That's a classic setup for cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissonance is where you have to rewrite </v>

677
00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:05.954
<v Speaker 3>the script in your head to make sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new information and here's what </v>

678
00:33:09.201 --> 00:33:10.034
<v Speaker 3>people don't do because we're all human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let me make this not a comment about </v>

679
00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:17.300
<v Speaker 3>just half of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So universal comment.</v>

680
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.200
<v Speaker 3>We rarely rewrite the script in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>head to say,</v>

681
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.303
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best way to explain this is that I </v>

682
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:27.530
<v Speaker 3>was a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody does that,</v>

683
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.180
<v Speaker 3>and there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

684
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.770
<v Speaker 3>That's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't do it.</v>

685
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:32.000
<v Speaker 3>You don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody does that.</v>

686
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.560
<v Speaker 3>So they have to come up with a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>script that explains their situation and</v>

687
00:33:36.561 --> 00:33:38.390
<v Speaker 3>so I think they've come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>

688
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.910
<v Speaker 3>there are more racist in the country </v>
<v Speaker 3>than we knew.</v>

689
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:44.750
<v Speaker 3>They voted this guy in a and he must </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

690
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:48.200
<v Speaker 3>he must have had help from Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's no way this happens in a</v>

691
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:49.034
<v Speaker 3>natural way because my world wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sense if he could get elected just </v>

692
00:33:52.671 --> 00:33:55.280
<v Speaker 3>by having policies people like couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

693
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.370
<v Speaker 3>So in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people are.</v>

694
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:59.683
<v Speaker 3>I hate to use triggered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a specific use of cognitive </v>

695
00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:03.974
<v Speaker 3>dissonance there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>World doesn't make sense and they're </v>

696
00:34:05.871 --> 00:34:10.460
<v Speaker 3>trying to make sense of it and it is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally painful experience,</v>

697
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:12.120
<v Speaker 3>which I have genuine sympathy for.</v>

698
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a guy that deals in persuasion for</v>

699
00:34:16.801 --> 00:34:18.390
<v Speaker 2>people that are watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are dealing with.</v>

700
00:34:18.391 --> 00:34:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Because I get emails everyday from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

701
00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother won't talk to me,</v>

702
00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:22.323
<v Speaker 2>my cousin or my wife won't talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten emails from people that are </v>

703
00:34:24.541 --> 00:34:25.374
<v Speaker 2>doing divorces over politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What techniques would you tell someone </v>

704
00:34:30.241 --> 00:34:34.710
<v Speaker 2>to do if their spouse was suffering from</v>
<v Speaker 2>this condition?</v>

705
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

706
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.290
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you.</v>

707
00:34:36.291 --> 00:34:37.340
<v Speaker 3>I was scrolling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

708
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.233
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had postulated over the summer before </v>

709
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.023
<v Speaker 3>the election that when a Clinton's </v>
<v Speaker 3>persuasion game went from very weak to </v>

710
00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:46.784
<v Speaker 3>nonexistent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to suddenly just weapons grade when she </v>

711
00:34:49.701 --> 00:34:52.130
<v Speaker 3>started calling everything that trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>did dark.</v>

712
00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:53.503
<v Speaker 3>That's the work of a real expert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have some speculation about who </v>

713
00:34:57.441 --> 00:35:00.140
<v Speaker 3>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for our purposes today,</v>

714
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:00.974
<v Speaker 3>just say it was super good persuasion </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was not like anything she'd done </v>

715
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:06.320
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that captured the thought that he's,</v>

716
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.850
<v Speaker 3>he's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's are racist as enough of every.</v>

717
00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Everything you wanted to put it in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one were captured,</v>

718
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.583
<v Speaker 3>had Clinton won,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bomb would have been diffused </v>

719
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.220
<v Speaker 3>because her side would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

720
00:35:19.221 --> 00:35:21.290
<v Speaker 3>we got what we wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We avoided the monster.</v>

721
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:23.810
<v Speaker 3>The trump people would've said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh darn,</v>

722
00:35:23.811 --> 00:35:27.470
<v Speaker 3>we lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't have thrown them for so much</v>

723
00:35:27.471 --> 00:35:28.304
<v Speaker 3>of the loop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wouldn't have thrown the loop </v>

724
00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.150
<v Speaker 3>where they sort of would have been used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to losing.</v>

725
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.163
<v Speaker 3>So it would've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would've been inconsistent with the </v>

726
00:35:34.491 --> 00:35:35.900
<v Speaker 3>polls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't like it,</v>

727
00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 3>but they wouldn't be thrown into </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive dissonance,</v>

728
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.910
<v Speaker 3>hesitant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

729
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 3>It would have seemed like a normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

730
00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>

731
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 3>this thought that there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this monster under the bed.</v>

732
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.470
<v Speaker 3>People lived with that as a real thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>for months.</v>

733
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:53.040
<v Speaker 3>And then when it didn't go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to continue living with it.</v>

734
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.690
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a setup.</v>

735
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.690
<v Speaker 3>So to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you get out of it?</v>

736
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.613
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you cure it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had predicted a way back before </v>

737
00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:07.671
<v Speaker 3>inauguration day that we would see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>following cycle or story arc,</v>

738
00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:08.724
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that on inauguration day it would be </v>

739
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:11.461
<v Speaker 3>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler,</v>

740
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:12.294
<v Speaker 3>Hitler marches in the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we saw that and I said that after </v>

741
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:19.080
<v Speaker 3>several months of him not doing Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

742
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 3>people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

743
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.260
<v Speaker 3>well it's not as bad as we thought.</v>

744
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.093
<v Speaker 3>He's not a healer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's incompetent and in and there's </v>

745
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:27.540
<v Speaker 3>chaos and he's just not going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>things right.</v>

746
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that's just as dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was the summer.</v>

747
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Remember I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was all forecast by me way ahead of</v>

748
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:36.600
<v Speaker 3>time because you could see that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have to happen.</v>

749
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:37.434
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I've predicted that by the end </v>

750
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:43.290
<v Speaker 3>of the year and we're getting close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would start to say,</v>

751
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did get a lot of things done,</v>

752
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 3>so maybe he's effective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't like what he's done.</v>

753
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not the justices they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the policies they wanted,</v>

754
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that part's just politics,</v>

755
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can all deal with that part,</v>

756
00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:57.953
<v Speaker 3>but well will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way you're going to get rid of </v>

757
00:36:59.101 --> 00:36:59.934
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the illusion that he's a monster is by </v>

758
00:37:01.891 --> 00:37:02.724
<v Speaker 3>him doing non monster stuff long enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you just can't hold the illusion </v>

759
00:37:06.031 --> 00:37:06.864
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

760
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.850
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's coming,</v>

761
00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:12.630
<v Speaker 3>and this is the fun part and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really the basis for the prediction,</v>

762
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.780
<v Speaker 3>is that every year at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>year of the news organizations,</v>

763
00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:16.614
<v Speaker 3>they sort of run out of real news and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do the year end roundups and </v>

764
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:21.690
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have to say what did he</v>
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>

765
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.960
<v Speaker 3>And that list is going to be really </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

766
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.920
<v Speaker 3>And it's gonna be all this stuff you </v>
<v Speaker 3>cared about minus self care.</v>

767
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:31.320
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even sure taxes will happen.</v>

768
00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:32.403
<v Speaker 3>Both the economy so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even sure it's important </v>

769
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:35.490
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

770
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 3>Will probably get four percent with or </v>
<v Speaker 3>without a tax change.</v>

771
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they'll be something with business</v>
<v Speaker 3>taxes.</v>

772
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

773
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.094
<v Speaker 3>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the list of things that he's </v>

774
00:37:45.751 --> 00:37:49.110
<v Speaker 3>done that Republicans wanted is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be so long.</v>

775
00:37:49.111 --> 00:37:53.040
<v Speaker 3>It would just be hard for people to hold</v>
<v Speaker 3>their heads that he wasn't effective.</v>

776
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.150
<v Speaker 3>And by next year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we get something with healthcare,</v>

777
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.733
<v Speaker 3>maybe something with taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to look like a hard to hold </v>

778
00:38:02.371 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 3>the the illusion anymore.</v>

779
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the media fits in all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this now?</v>

780
00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:07.664
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that you can very easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>chalk up there and attitude and obvious </v>

781
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.930
<v Speaker 1>cheering at first for Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then ultimately for Hillary,</v>

782
00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.410
<v Speaker 1>you can chalk that up to why so many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trump people,</v>

783
00:38:18.411 --> 00:38:19.244
<v Speaker 1>and I include myself in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm thrilled the way the media is </v>

784
00:38:21.621 --> 00:38:23.480
<v Speaker 1>crumbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's phenomenal.</v>

785
00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I just this this past week there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idiotic thing with trump in Japan.</v>

786
00:38:28.491 --> 00:38:29.324
<v Speaker 1>You saw this with the prime minister of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan and CNN tweets the video out and </v>

787
00:38:32.811 --> 00:38:33.201
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

788
00:38:33.201 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 1>implying that he's being disrespectful </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the fish</v>

789
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 2>food in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Koi pond or whatever.</v>

790
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 2>What they don't show you is literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>the second before that.</v>

791
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.330
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what the Japanese Prime </v>
<v Speaker 2>Minister David,</v>

792
00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they keep doing this?</v>

793
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:48.723
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot chalk this up to complete </v>

794
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.980
<v Speaker 2>idiocy and ineptitude anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they keep.</v>

795
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.130
<v Speaker 2>How have they not fired?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean CNN every day.</v>

796
00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Should be just firing people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw.</v>

797
00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:01.600
<v Speaker 2>They should be throwing them off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>roof of the Time Warner Center.</v>

798
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.823
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately the economics of the news </v>

799
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:06.454
<v Speaker 2>business has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be you could have the three </v>

800
00:39:08.351 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 2>big networks and they can just deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the facts as they knew him,</v>

801
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:12.903
<v Speaker 2>but now I don't think you could make </v>
<v Speaker 2>money that way because people are </v>

802
00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 2>looking to feel to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to digest the news that they like.</v>

803
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:19.924
<v Speaker 2>It makes them feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're always going to have a media </v>

804
00:39:23.001 --> 00:39:23.834
<v Speaker 2>on the right media on the left and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think that middle may never be </v>

805
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:31.150
<v Speaker 2>filled because there's no way to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>money in the middle because if you go in</v>

806
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:33.070
<v Speaker 2>the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides will say,</v>

807
00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:35.020
<v Speaker 2>well half the time you're just making </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff up.</v>

808
00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Because interestingly I think the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle,</v>

809
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.513
<v Speaker 2>whatever that middle is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it does sort of exist in this </v>

810
00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:43.620
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The space that you're.</v>

811
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Even though you're not a creator on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube or whatever,</v>

812
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.760
<v Speaker 2>it kind of exists in this land of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rogan and de Franco and me and whoever.</v>

813
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that influence is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it sort of exists at the risk of</v>

814
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:55.563
<v Speaker 2>complimenting you own show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be the closest thing and the </v>

815
00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:02.680
<v Speaker 2>only thing I can think of that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle right now,</v>

816
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:03.603
<v Speaker 2>like easily identifiable as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a legitimate attempt to be in the </v>

817
00:40:07.241 --> 00:40:07.931
<v Speaker 2>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

818
00:40:07.931 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Speaker 2>other people have their spin on things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

819
00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:14.530
<v Speaker 2>But I don't even see others trial one </v>
<v Speaker 2>compliment per year on the show of me.</v>

820
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.393
<v Speaker 2>So that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

821
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I was waiting for someone to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're already in November.</v>

822
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:19.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

823
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

824
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.043
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to go outside the TV model to </v>

825
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:26.140
<v Speaker 2>even make this work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay.</v>

826
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.210
<v Speaker 2>So you are thrilled with the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>media is being destroyed,</v>

827
00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:28.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

828
00:40:28.661 --> 00:40:30.580
<v Speaker 2>is there any piece of you that misses </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

829
00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 2>We get our news from three places and </v>
<v Speaker 2>can make some factual sense together and</v>

830
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:36.270
<v Speaker 2>any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

831
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:37.243
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't find any joy in that because </v>

832
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:43.120
<v Speaker 2>it's just something that's broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get happy about that.</v>

833
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.100
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not happy about anybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction,</v>

834
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.353
<v Speaker 2>but I understand your point that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like it feels like if people are </v>

835
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:52.240
<v Speaker 2>not doing their job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want bad things to happen to him,</v>

836
00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:55.300
<v Speaker 2>but I can't quite get in that mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean specific.</v>

837
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't want him to be hurt or anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that of course.</v>

838
00:40:57.431 --> 00:41:00.760
<v Speaker 2>But just the general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state of this nonsense.</v>

839
00:41:00.761 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 2>That's why when people say to me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what trump lies about this all the time,</v>

840
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.920
<v Speaker 2>well Hillary lied about this all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

841
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Obama lied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you like your doctor,</v>

842
00:41:07.571 --> 00:41:08.780
<v Speaker 2>you can keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

843
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 2>the Syrian red line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

844
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.290
<v Speaker 2>well all of them lie in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to,</v>

845
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:16.450
<v Speaker 2>they just all aligned the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lied in a politician's way.</v>

846
00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:17.284
<v Speaker 2>He lies in a new way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't particularly like either one of </v>

847
00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:22.420
<v Speaker 2>them but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a little bit of real politic</v>

848
00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:25.510
<v Speaker 2>here and I think that's where you sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of operate and just sort of there's,</v>

849
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.433
<v Speaker 2>there's reality and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and they have a little bit </v>

850
00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:29.674
<v Speaker 2>overlay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's the only way I could </v>

851
00:41:30.731 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>stake out a position that wasn't one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the crazy on the right are</v>

852
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 3>crazy on the left is by the persuasion </v>
<v Speaker 3>filter.</v>

853
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.040
<v Speaker 3>It was sort of a step back from politics</v>
<v Speaker 3>per se,</v>

854
00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:44.800
<v Speaker 3>and that gave me a little bit of ability</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be as objective as I can.</v>

855
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is completely objective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

856
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that middle will be</v>

857
00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:52.050
<v Speaker 2>where you make all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>

858
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

859
00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.080
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of alone here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

860
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making dilbert money.</v>

861
00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't be working on a comic strip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be your major advice.</v>

862
00:42:00.581 --> 00:42:01.414
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell everybody who started comics </v>

863
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:04.640
<v Speaker 2>started kind of extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's quit your job,</v>

864
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.100
<v Speaker 2>quit your job right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

865
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.023
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's kind of funny that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>end up talking about politics so </v>

866
00:42:08.771 --> 00:42:11.710
<v Speaker 2>directly because obviously before we </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned it,</v>

867
00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:14.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean you were always sort of giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>people a grain of truth more about their</v>

868
00:42:14.561 --> 00:42:17.830
<v Speaker 2>life and sort of the working world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that,</v>

869
00:42:17.831 --> 00:42:19.930
<v Speaker 2>but it was more social commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

870
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.880
<v Speaker 2>but this is a lot of politics now.</v>

871
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:22.783
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his way closer than you think because </v>

872
00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:27.560
<v Speaker 3>since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since the things I talk about are the,</v>

873
00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.730
<v Speaker 3>I would say the illusions that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

874
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.990
<v Speaker 3>in the comic I would write about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>illusion that there's,</v>

875
00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:36.830
<v Speaker 3>this three hour meeting was better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the two hour meeting.</v>

876
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.110
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was just an illusion.</v>

877
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.213
<v Speaker 3>Yet people buy into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a widespread practice and I just </v>

878
00:42:44.661 --> 00:42:45.494
<v Speaker 3>took that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

879
00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that same mindset,</v>

880
00:42:47.241 --> 00:42:49.640
<v Speaker 3>which is you understand that this isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

881
00:42:49.641 --> 00:42:52.370
<v Speaker 3>these things you're doing in the office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things don't help.</v>

882
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.503
<v Speaker 3>These don't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This new business policy just sounds </v>

883
00:42:55.941 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 3>good on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely doesn't work.</v>

884
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.160
<v Speaker 3>It's really just the same analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just took it to a different field.</v>

885
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious,</v>

886
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 2>has there been some kind of cost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

887
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.610
<v Speaker 2>professionally or personally for you on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

888
00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot to quote you.</v>

889
00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:13.160
<v Speaker 2>I pretty sure you said that you do have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you money.</v>

890
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what you said to me last </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

891
00:43:14.991 --> 00:43:17.840
<v Speaker 2>So you may not care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm curious what the cost has been.</v>

892
00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:18.953
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think I've lost 75 percent of my </v>

893
00:43:20.781 --> 00:43:22.190
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

894
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:23.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you mean that literally,</v>

895
00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean that literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

896
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.083
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you were just staking </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a trump position and then you going </v>

897
00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:28.570
<v Speaker 2>to scale it back the 20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

898
00:43:28.571 --> 00:43:30.500
<v Speaker 2>I haven't actually done the calculation </v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

899
00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.970
<v Speaker 2>but it feels like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really,</v>

900
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's true.</v>

901
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I look at my facebook feed and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

902
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.313
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally thought facebook wasn't </v>

903
00:43:38.661 --> 00:43:41.240
<v Speaker 2>working for awhile and that's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not working.</v>

904
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

905
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:44.570
<v Speaker 2>it must be some kind of major problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>with facebook.</v>

906
00:43:44.571 --> 00:43:45.404
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not seeing anything from all of my </v>

907
00:43:46.161 --> 00:43:47.510
<v Speaker 2>friends here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

908
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:52.280
<v Speaker 2>and then financially a big part of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>author's income is speaking.</v>

909
00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

910
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:57.590
<v Speaker 2>I can say this now that now that I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>no speaking engagements lined up,</v>

911
00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime in the future and if not for the</v>

912
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.633
<v Speaker 2>past year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was making anywhere from 50 to </v>

913
00:44:03.561 --> 00:44:04.394
<v Speaker 2>$100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to talk for an hour that went to </v>

914
00:44:07.341 --> 00:44:08.174
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning I have nothing booked in the </v>

915
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.290
<v Speaker 2>past year and nothing booked for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future year.</v>

916
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:17.410
<v Speaker 2>And that's never happened anytime in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional career after the first five</v>

917
00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:21.230
<v Speaker 2>years when Dilbert became well known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

918
00:44:21.231 --> 00:44:24.620
<v Speaker 2>I find that particularly bizarre because</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

919
00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:25.454
<v Speaker 2>you're not a hateful person or any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that people might say about </v>

920
00:44:28.371 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 2>you or be the things that you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about generally have come true.</v>

921
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.293
<v Speaker 2>So the worth of having you speak there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still worth and having you </v>

922
00:44:36.001 --> 00:44:36.690
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I get it.</v>

923
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:37.261
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

924
00:44:37.261 --> 00:44:38.670
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to pay a trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporter.</v>

925
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.420
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

926
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.253
<v Speaker 2>that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really even the people who were </v>

927
00:44:42.031 --> 00:44:43.710
<v Speaker 2>making the decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

928
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.500
<v Speaker 2>they understand the nuance and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you tell them,</v>

929
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 2>well that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not about the policies,</v>

930
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.493
<v Speaker 2>they get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their job is to make sure that </v>

931
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a big room full of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't feel bad.</v>

932
00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:54.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're not going to take a chance </v>

933
00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 2>that the people in the room will have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different interpretation.</v>

934
00:44:58.290 --> 00:44:59.101
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

935
00:44:59.101 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Was it mostly like corporate type gigs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thing it was almost entirely corporate</v>

936
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:04.590
<v Speaker 2>and big organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

937
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.513
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that also shows you another symptom of </v>

938
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:08.540
<v Speaker 2>what's happening in the world right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

939
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.860
<v Speaker 2>That someone who basically is just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate,</v>

940
00:45:10.861 --> 00:45:15.480
<v Speaker 2>decent guy who's saying some things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe his is a supporter of a guy that's</v>

941
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.300
<v Speaker 2>not popular in the popular sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>

942
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a corporation just doesn't want to put </v>

943
00:45:21.091 --> 00:45:21.210
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

944
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:22.130
<v Speaker 2>But online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

945
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:23.340
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me,</v>

946
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.400
<v Speaker 2>let me state that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

947
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.730
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be poor like that.</v>

948
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.550
<v Speaker 2>That isn't going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

949
00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.880
<v Speaker 2>and I knew what I was getting into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

950
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I were,</v>

951
00:45:34.081 --> 00:45:36.450
<v Speaker 2>we're professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people watching might say,</v>

952
00:45:36.451 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that poor guy,</v>

953
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 2>he walked into the buzzsaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see the buzzsaw,</v>

954
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.230
<v Speaker 2>we choose to walk into it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

955
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a bigger something there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this case,</v>

956
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:47.723
<v Speaker 2>this was this weird special case where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's entire worldview was going to </v>

957
00:45:52.351 --> 00:45:53.184
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that when I saw trump enter </v>

958
00:45:54.871 --> 00:45:57.420
<v Speaker 2>because he had that kind of effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

959
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:58.263
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would be helpful to be sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a guide to help people understand </v>

960
00:46:01.441 --> 00:46:04.800
<v Speaker 2>what they were seeing so that they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinterpret the reality and to,</v>

961
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.810
<v Speaker 2>to something that was more functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>and less trump derangement syndrome.</v>

962
00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:09.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

963
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:10.140
<v Speaker 2>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

964
00:46:10.141 --> 00:46:10.974
<v Speaker 2>that's why you're good at what you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I listened and that's why I </v>

965
00:46:14.221 --> 00:46:16.890
<v Speaker 2>wasn't crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I think my audience,</v>

966
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was appalling,</v>

967
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:22.110
<v Speaker 2>my entire audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which way they voted or whatever it is.</v>

968
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.810
<v Speaker 2>But I think that for most of them they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

969
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.360
<v Speaker 2>they didn't go off the deep end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

970
00:46:27.361 --> 00:46:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Like they actually didn't go crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've sort of.</v>

971
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I try to keep my people dealing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

972
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.890
<v Speaker 2>which somehow is very special these </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

973
00:46:34.891 --> 00:46:38.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize it was special but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But apparently it is.</v>

974
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

975
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how long it will take for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are screaming at this guy</v>

976
00:46:45.721 --> 00:46:47.790
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to effect some change.</v>

977
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:50.580
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the keys could be,</v>

978
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.400
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not predicting that these will </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

979
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:54.263
<v Speaker 2>but these would be the keys if president</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump did something useful in North </v>

980
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Korea that really looked to people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

981
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.293
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that common and something </v>

982
00:47:05.941 --> 00:47:07.980
<v Speaker 2>good happened with healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which by the way,</v>

983
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I think both of them are entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

984
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

985
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.133
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what the odds are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they seem very possible to me it </v>

986
00:47:16.441 --> 00:47:17.274
<v Speaker 2>would be hard a year from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two to feel the same way about his </v>

987
00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:23.280
<v Speaker 2>presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assuming he doesn't do any,</v>

988
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:25.980
<v Speaker 2>anything that's extra bad between now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then.</v>

989
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Is that also just the nature of basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>human psychology that you can only</v>

990
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.760
<v Speaker 1>scream for so much time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they've.</v>

991
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 1>They've really dragged this screaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

992
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't do that forever.</v>

993
00:47:36.761 --> 00:47:37.594
<v Speaker 1>Your brain.</v>

994
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:38.623
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother had a saying and I don't know </v>

995
00:47:40.011 --> 00:47:41.010
<v Speaker 3>where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She.</v>

996
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.260
<v Speaker 3>She said you can get used to anything if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it long enough,</v>

997
00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.570
<v Speaker 3>including hanging hang long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just get used to it.</v>

998
00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.100
<v Speaker 3>And I've predicted for a long time that </v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

999
00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:53.293
<v Speaker 3>as provocative as president trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as he stays provocative in the </v>

1000
00:47:57.081 --> 00:47:59.870
<v Speaker 3>same way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will get used to it.</v>

1001
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.033
<v Speaker 3>And I think you're starting to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's certainly a big segment of </v>

1002
00:48:04.041 --> 00:48:06.590
<v Speaker 3>the population that is now close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting used to it.</v>

1003
00:48:06.591 --> 00:48:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you make of the Russia thing?</v>

1004
00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:13.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say on camera.</v>

1005
00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:13.933
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing there and there's </v>

1006
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:16.720
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There never will be anything there.</v>

1007
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:21.110
<v Speaker 3>But at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this conversation,</v>

1008
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.870
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing that looks like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime that,</v>

1009
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.960
<v Speaker 3>that influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's involving the president directly.</v>

1010
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be surprised if there is,</v>

1011
00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:30.970
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1012
00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:35.480
<v Speaker 3>certainly if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be some kind of technical thing</v>

1013
00:48:35.481 --> 00:48:37.370
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the average person says,</v>

1014
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:39.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know that was a grime.</v>

1015
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:41.360
<v Speaker 3>So that's what happens when you get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>

1016
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 3>The special prosecutor in there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1017
00:48:43.811 --> 00:48:48.320
<v Speaker 3>They're looking for crimes now and at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain level of,</v>

1018
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:49.203
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1019
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:50.210
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

1020
00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:51.973
<v Speaker 3>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are doing stuff that's going to </v>

1021
00:48:54.651 --> 00:48:56.810
<v Speaker 3>violate some law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1022
00:48:56.811 --> 00:48:58.850
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or an ethical violation.</v>

1023
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.370
<v Speaker 3>So if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to find stuff,</v>

1024
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:04.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my guess is there's more smoke than,</v>

1025
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:09.080
<v Speaker 3>than fire and that the smoke has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of generated by the coverage of it.</v>

1026
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:09.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1027
00:49:09.651 --> 00:49:11.930
<v Speaker 1>every time they keep pushing more smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>

1028
00:49:11.931 --> 00:49:15.680
<v Speaker 1>the smoke actually starts looking like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it also has a lot to do with Hillary and</v>

1029
00:49:15.681 --> 00:49:17.300
<v Speaker 1>the DNC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

1030
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:18.283
<v Speaker 1>you all better be very careful what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask for here because this could take </v>

1031
00:49:20.361 --> 00:49:21.180
<v Speaker 1>down all of you.</v>

1032
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the question I ask is Russia is</v>

1033
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:27.360
<v Speaker 3>sort of a weird relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>

1034
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:29.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's sort of Frenemies,</v>

1035
00:49:29.281 --> 00:49:30.114
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want them on our side but they seem </v>

1036
00:49:32.581 --> 00:49:35.010
<v Speaker 3>to be doing stuff to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bother us.</v>

1037
00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have fairly deep connections and,</v>

1038
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:40.773
<v Speaker 3>and have had for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are lots of people having lots </v>

1039
00:49:43.231 --> 00:49:47.310
<v Speaker 3>of conversations at powerful levels </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably all the time.</v>

1040
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:48.583
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at them and you look </v>

1041
00:49:50.131 --> 00:49:51.510
<v Speaker 3>at them through a certain filter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1042
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:52.363
<v Speaker 3>well now it looks wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas maybe in a different time we </v>

1043
00:49:54.901 --> 00:49:55.770
<v Speaker 3>would just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1044
00:49:55.771 --> 00:49:56.604
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't we be talking to someone </v>

1045
00:49:58.201 --> 00:50:01.020
<v Speaker 3>who has so many interests that overlap </v>
<v Speaker 3>with ours?</v>

1046
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That does show,</v>

1047
00:50:02.181 --> 00:50:02.310
<v Speaker 3>that show the</v>

1048
00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:05.970
<v Speaker 1>way things flipped very easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems like the Democrats.</v>

1049
00:50:05.971 --> 00:50:06.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1050
00:50:06.421 --> 00:50:08.970
<v Speaker 1>if you took this thing to it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's pretend there was,</v>

1051
00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:11.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some legit reason for them to be talking</v>

1052
00:50:11.671 --> 00:50:12.180
<v Speaker 1>about Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1053
00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.013
<v Speaker 1>what are we really saying then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to depose the president of </v>

1054
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:16.673
<v Speaker 1>the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't then put pence in because </v>

1055
00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:20.520
<v Speaker 1>he probably knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't have his guy in there.</v>

1056
00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:23.070
<v Speaker 1>And then what are you really saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we go down the line of succession</v>

1057
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.170
<v Speaker 1>should um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1058
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Ryan then be installed.</v>

1059
00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1060
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.710
<v Speaker 2>really what are you saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because then if they actually hacked our</v>

1061
00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:32.720
<v Speaker 2>election and put the president in </v>
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>

1062
00:50:32.721 --> 00:50:35.830
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously an active war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are you saying we should do Gresha?</v>

1063
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it seems to me we've got,</v>

1064
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:39.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama running around the whole country </v>

1065
00:50:40.431 --> 00:50:42.380
<v Speaker 2>do and his $500,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars speeches,</v>

1066
00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:43.214
<v Speaker 2>which I don't begrudge him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with that shit eating grin and </v>

1067
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:45.914
<v Speaker 2>everybody else is out there doing their </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where if they knew that the </v>

1068
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:49.543
<v Speaker 2>president was a Russian spy or colluded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they'd be out in the streets </v>

1069
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:54.074
<v Speaker 2>screaming about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that really </v>

1070
00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.054
<v Speaker 2>strikes me is that there are things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are alleged as a trader is illegal </v>

1071
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 2>activities that if you had asked me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this traitorous or illegal,</v>

1072
00:51:07.071 --> 00:51:09.350
<v Speaker 2>I would have said it doesn't sound like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to me.</v>

1073
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:13.130
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the Russians had some dirt on Hillary</v>

1074
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:14.383
<v Speaker 2>and if they offered it to the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had asked me without any of this </v>

1075
00:51:17.601 --> 00:51:20.480
<v Speaker 2>news coverage in which we've all learned</v>
<v Speaker 2>more about how this works,</v>

1076
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:25.870
<v Speaker 2>is it illegal to gather information from</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who has information?</v>

1077
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it illegal to talk to people?</v>

1078
00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't it be illegal to know more </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's true,</v>

1079
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.660
<v Speaker 2>why would it be illegal to have true </v>
<v Speaker 2>information?</v>

1080
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:37.063
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting distinction </v>

1081
00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:38.990
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's pause there for a second.</v>

1082
00:51:38.991 --> 00:51:39.824
<v Speaker 2>So if the Russian government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say had been falsifying </v>

1083
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:43.154
<v Speaker 2>information and passed it on to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump campaign and then the trump </v>

1084
00:51:45.741 --> 00:51:46.574
<v Speaker 2>campaign used it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would see that you would view that </v>

1085
00:51:48.711 --> 00:51:49.544
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the information itself has to be </v>

1086
00:51:51.591 --> 00:51:52.880
<v Speaker 2>true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1087
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:53.953
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people would view that </v>

1088
00:51:54.531 --> 00:51:56.360
<v Speaker 2>differently because that would look more</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a.</v>

1089
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.823
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either way it looks like Russia is </v>

1090
00:51:58.791 --> 00:51:59.624
<v Speaker 2>trying to influence things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just because they're trying to </v>

1091
00:52:02.391 --> 00:52:05.390
<v Speaker 2>influence things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that mean that the person who would</v>

1092
00:52:05.391 --> 00:52:09.530
<v Speaker 2>benefit from the information is is </v>
<v Speaker 2>forbidden from having it now?</v>

1093
00:52:09.531 --> 00:52:12.740
<v Speaker 2>This is where you have to be a lawyer to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know whether or not that's illegal.</v>

1094
00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1095
00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I can get the argument that it might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>unethical,</v>

1096
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 2>like and get the argument that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do it.</v>

1097
00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I can get the argument that Russia </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be meddling and we need to.</v>

1098
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:24.613
<v Speaker 2>We need to respond in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how is it illegal for a person to </v>

1099
00:52:27.981 --> 00:52:28.814
<v Speaker 2>hear information and way in what world </v>
<v Speaker 2>does the source of the information </v>

1100
00:52:33.081 --> 00:52:35.330
<v Speaker 2>matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's actual inflammation,</v>

1101
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.360
<v Speaker 2>well that's why it's funny you saw when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1102
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:41.300
<v Speaker 2>what was it about a month and a half ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>when trump jr,</v>

1103
00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:45.650
<v Speaker 2>the whole week was that trump jr met </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the person who may have gotten some</v>

1104
00:52:45.651 --> 00:52:46.484
<v Speaker 2>information from the Russians or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was and everyone was </v>

1105
00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:49.760
<v Speaker 2>screaming about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1106
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:52.220
<v Speaker 2>you get opposition research but not from</v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries,</v>

1107
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:52.820
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

1108
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:53.653
<v Speaker 2>And then just in the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks it came out that for sure the DNC </v>

1109
00:52:56.721 --> 00:52:57.554
<v Speaker 2>was at least working at some level with </v>
<v Speaker 2>either this Ukrainian guy or the </v>

1110
00:53:01.671 --> 00:53:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Russians to make the dossier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1111
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:04.343
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we don't even have to go into </v>

1112
00:53:05.691 --> 00:53:07.370
<v Speaker 2>all of it because it's just like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all dirty,</v>

1113
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.430
<v Speaker 2>your own narrative and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1114
00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:11.283
<v Speaker 2>it's such a confusing area that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>public doesn't have any idea what's </v>

1115
00:53:16.341 --> 00:53:17.420
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now with Russia,</v>

1116
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.690
<v Speaker 2>we know there's something about Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about lawyers,</v>

1117
00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:22.203
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you were to ask the average </v>

1118
00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:24.450
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1119
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:26.020
<v Speaker 2>you've probably seen these straight</v>

1120
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.990
<v Speaker 3>interviews where somebody goes out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1121
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:32.280
<v Speaker 3>name the vice president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States and they're like a mickey mouse.</v>

1122
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have no idea.</v>

1123
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:36.270
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine going out in the street and just</v>

1124
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.373
<v Speaker 3>grabbing a person and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you sort out the Russia thing for </v>

1125
00:53:39.421 --> 00:53:40.130
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can,</v>

1126
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.963
<v Speaker 3>can you tell me who did what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to tell you that there </v>

1127
00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:47.550
<v Speaker 3>something about a Russian lawyer of </v>
<v Speaker 3>uranium on a hotel bad.</v>

1128
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.013
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this mess of stuff that they've </v>

1129
00:53:50.731 --> 00:53:53.910
<v Speaker 3>conflated in their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The public has no idea what's going on.</v>

1130
00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:54.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you figure out what news you </v>

1131
00:53:57.241 --> 00:54:01.350
<v Speaker 3>believe and what you think is true and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you can actually trust?</v>

1132
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.513
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think every situation you got to look </v>

1133
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 3>at it differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1134
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:08.220
<v Speaker 3>so the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first sort,</v>

1135
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:12.600
<v Speaker 3>if I see it on either Fox or I see it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN,</v>

1136
00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:13.913
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I do is go to the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>one because you have two tvs next to </v>

1137
00:54:17.881 --> 00:54:18.490
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1138
00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:19.323
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a clicker and I wait because it's </v>

1139
00:54:22.381 --> 00:54:24.060
<v Speaker 3>not going to be at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily,</v>

1140
00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:28.020
<v Speaker 3>but I wait because my experience is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a factual basis,</v>

1141
00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 3>they all pretty much get the facts </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1142
00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the interpretation.</v>

1143
00:54:32.371 --> 00:54:33.204
<v Speaker 3>It's the priority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how much attention they put it </v>

1144
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 3>switched pundits come on and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about it?</v>

1145
00:54:38.161 --> 00:54:39.530
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is where all the,</v>

1146
00:54:39.531 --> 00:54:41.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bias happens.</v>

1147
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.890
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing is that they both say</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and if they do,</v>

1148
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:47.430
<v Speaker 3>I start feeling comfortable that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some truth to it.</v>

1149
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:48.543
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then all the spin comes and almost </v>

1150
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:53.560
<v Speaker 3>all of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1151
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.300
<v Speaker 3>nonfactual spin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1152
00:54:55.301 --> 00:54:57.870
<v Speaker 3>I of discount all of that from both </v>
<v Speaker 3>sides.</v>

1153
00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:58.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think anyone's doing the </v>

1154
00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:04.350
<v Speaker 3>persuasion game correctly on the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>side?</v>

1155
00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:09.380
<v Speaker 3>So whoever might be your intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 3>opponent buys into all of the things,</v>

1156
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.390
<v Speaker 3>say of the modern Democratic Party.</v>

1157
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:15.450
<v Speaker 3>Is there anyone that's kind of doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1158
00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:16.533
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you disagree with all of the </v>

1159
00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:19.680
<v Speaker 3>conclusions are what they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build.</v>

1160
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:22.170
<v Speaker 3>And let me say something that I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes a,</v>

1161
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 3>you can make at least half of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>listeners just flip out.</v>

1162
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:26.663
<v Speaker 3>George Clooney has game right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he can run because the </v>

1163
00:55:31.711 --> 00:55:36.711
<v Speaker 3>whole Hollywood Weinstein connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in a recent interview I saw,</v>

1164
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I saw so much technique that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1165
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.920
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know he had that much </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>

1166
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:47.880
<v Speaker 3>And he basically was setting himself up </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if people begged,</v>

1167
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.110
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would run a.</v>

1168
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:51.440
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you agree,</v>

1169
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:54.690
<v Speaker 3>because once they did some polling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might find out he has some issues,</v>

1170
00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:00.080
<v Speaker 3>but he has the charisma and he has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>persuasion game that if he could bring a</v>

1171
00:56:00.631 --> 00:56:03.480
<v Speaker 3>little bit of substance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would actually be quite formidable.</v>

1172
00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:04.613
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he can be trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he could probably really take a run </v>

1173
00:56:08.551 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 3>at someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1174
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.520
<v Speaker 3>a regular Republican.</v>

1175
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:12.960
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>likewise.</v>

1176
00:56:12.961 --> 00:56:13.794
<v Speaker 3>Mark Cuban,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's definitely making some noise in </v>

1177
00:56:16.891 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 3>this space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1178
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:18.533
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he did an interesting thing by </v>

1179
00:56:20.131 --> 00:56:24.760
<v Speaker 3>saying that he could potentially be </v>
<v Speaker 3>either a republican or a Democrat,</v>

1180
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.490
<v Speaker 3>which was kind of clever because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>allows both,</v>

1181
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 3>both groups to see him until he commits </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

1182
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe one of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1183
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:33.723
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think somebody said that he said </v>

1184
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:37.114
<v Speaker 3>he would maybe run as Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Republicans have a long memory </v>

1185
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.473
<v Speaker 3>and there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way he gets elected as a </v>

1186
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:47.740
<v Speaker 3>Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But could he be elected as a Democrat if</v>

1187
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 3>you brought in some ideas that involve </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

1188
00:56:50.981 --> 00:56:51.814
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would maybe get us to better </v>

1189
00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.033
<v Speaker 3>healthcare or a way to get to free </v>
<v Speaker 3>college because that's the part that </v>

1190
00:56:58.571 --> 00:57:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Bernie was missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had everything right,</v>

1191
00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:04.840
<v Speaker 3>except the connecting tissues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you get there that you could</v>

1192
00:57:04.841 --> 00:57:05.674
<v Speaker 3>afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Technology could probably get there or </v>

1193
00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:09.520
<v Speaker 3>at least you could make a story that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>could get there.</v>

1194
00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:10.990
<v Speaker 3>And I think it would be believable </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we.</v>

1195
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Because I think because I think we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Hubert could,</v>

1196
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.780
<v Speaker 3>could make that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's got the charisma.</v>

1197
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.680
<v Speaker 3>He's got the brains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be able to pull it off,</v>

1198
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.580
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if he'll run as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrats.</v>

1199
00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.150
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1200
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.983
<v Speaker 2>so not that I have any love of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>career politicians or people that have </v>

1201
00:57:26.781 --> 00:57:28.400
<v Speaker 2>just been around positive about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting.</v>

1202
00:57:28.401 --> 00:57:30.230
<v Speaker 2>You just went basically to all </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities.</v>

1203
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Even Cuban in effect really is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrity at this point.</v>

1204
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't charisma</v>

1205
00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:37.240
<v Speaker 3>if there had been any standard </v>
<v Speaker 3>politician with charisma,</v>

1206
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 3>I would probably gravitate to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Van Van Jones is very good,</v>

1207
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.780
<v Speaker 3>he would be high on my list of </v>
<v Speaker 3>charismatic democratic,</v>

1208
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.133
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he agreed to do the show and then CNN </v>

1209
00:57:50.211 --> 00:57:51.850
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't let them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So really,</v>

1210
00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:54.320
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where that puts my feelings</v>

1211
00:57:54.321 --> 00:57:57.500
<v Speaker 2>about him or at least he said he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it on twitter and then they said no.</v>

1212
00:57:57.501 --> 00:58:01.730
<v Speaker 2>So maybe he was just playing me for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sort of the public credit of.</v>

1213
00:58:01.731 --> 00:58:02.564
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it and then leave it to my guys </v>

1214
00:58:04.221 --> 00:58:06.020
<v Speaker 2>who will just say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the details,</v>

1215
00:58:06.021 --> 00:58:10.260
<v Speaker 2>but I find him credible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>credible story with the safe.</v>

1216
00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my guess is that he told you the truth.</v>

1217
00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1218
00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:17.353
<v Speaker 2>so if we can't have sort of regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians anymore because that's real </v>

1219
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:22.223
<v Speaker 2>easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're celebrities or just </v>

1220
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:25.340
<v Speaker 2>because you're saying these people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist in the world.</v>

1221
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:28.820
<v Speaker 2>It seems that the longterm health of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1222
00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:29.773
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't strike me as that great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that case that we're just going to </v>

1223
00:58:32.731 --> 00:58:36.410
<v Speaker 2>keep you living in a world where facts </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't matter.</v>

1224
00:58:36.411 --> 00:58:40.850
<v Speaker 2>We're going to keep sort of putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>persuasion sort of ahead of.</v>

1225
00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.040
<v Speaker 2>We've always been that way</v>

1226
00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.440
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a new world,</v>

1227
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:44.303
<v Speaker 3>it's just that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a character in the president </v>

1228
00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:50.310
<v Speaker 3>right now who takes it to a level where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't miss it.</v>

1229
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.770
<v Speaker 3>I think before you had the luxury of </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1230
00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:54.600
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my site is telling the truth,</v>

1231
00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:57.870
<v Speaker 3>but we don't even have that luxury </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1232
00:58:57.871 --> 00:58:58.704
<v Speaker 3>Like even if you're a pro trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that the fact checkers are not </v>

1233
00:59:02.461 --> 00:59:03.294
<v Speaker 3>wrong every time you just don't think it</v>
<v Speaker 3>matters because he's persuading and a </v>

1234
00:59:08.101 --> 00:59:09.030
<v Speaker 3>direction that you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1235
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:09.993
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well to put a nice bow than on this </v>

1236
00:59:12.151 --> 00:59:14.820
<v Speaker 2>whole conversation since you've done a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice job.</v>

1237
00:59:14.821 --> 00:59:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I think persuading people in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1238
00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:19.560
<v Speaker 2>I am upfront and admit you've helped </v>
<v Speaker 2>persuade me in certain ways.</v>

1239
00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want some at you.</v>

1240
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Adam's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's this all going?</v>

1241
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Does this guy run again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way?</v>

1242
00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 2>It will be about three years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1243
00:59:27.801 --> 00:59:31.400
<v Speaker 2>does he step aside and the Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally wake up to some of this stuff?</v>

1244
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Lay it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me something here.</v>

1245
00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:34.163
<v Speaker 3>I think you're going to see you </v>
<v Speaker 3>something good with healthcare maybe by </v>

1246
00:59:36.541 --> 00:59:37.374
<v Speaker 3>the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the economy will stay </v>

1247
00:59:39.511 --> 00:59:42.300
<v Speaker 3>strong unless there's some surprise that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't seen,</v>

1248
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.550
<v Speaker 3>but straight line it looks like it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to stay strong.</v>

1249
00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:48.990
<v Speaker 3>I think we'll hit four percent GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

1250
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:52.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of trump's four years,</v>

1251
00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:57.480
<v Speaker 3>unless something new happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to look really successful and</v>

1252
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:58.343
<v Speaker 3>if he's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he will at least consider going out on </v>

1253
01:00:01.591 --> 01:00:02.424
<v Speaker 3>top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially because age becomes a little </v>

1254
01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:05.034
<v Speaker 3>bit more of an issue at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for a brand or somebody who would </v>

1255
01:00:08.101 --> 01:00:09.390
<v Speaker 3>like to go out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1256
01:00:09.391 --> 01:00:10.224
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also have a company with my name on </v>

1257
01:00:11.551 --> 01:00:14.400
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might make sense to go out on top,</v>

1258
01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.533
<v Speaker 3>but he's also a really competitive guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he might just want to take it to </v>

1259
01:00:20.461 --> 01:00:21.294
<v Speaker 3>the next level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure that I'm rooting for </v>

1260
01:00:23.521 --> 01:00:26.250
<v Speaker 3>that because I think age has to matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that job.</v>

1261
01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suspect that even if everything </v>

1262
01:00:28.721 --> 01:00:29.554
<v Speaker 2>you predict there is true and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's going great and it looks </v>

1263
01:00:31.031 --> 01:00:33.040
<v Speaker 2>like he could win again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think,</v>

1264
01:00:33.041 --> 01:00:33.874
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the guy who made the apprentice </v>

1265
01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:36.603
<v Speaker 2>and that it would be like he would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>anoint his successor and then that </v>

1266
01:00:39.671 --> 01:00:40.504
<v Speaker 2>person would have to do the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's don junior or whoever else </v>

1267
01:00:43.001 --> 01:00:43.834
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that he would then step off as the </v>

1268
01:00:45.881 --> 01:00:48.620
<v Speaker 2>king and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even risk,</v>

1269
01:00:48.621 --> 01:00:50.740
<v Speaker 2>you already pulled off one major coup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1270
01:00:50.741 --> 01:00:52.930
<v Speaker 2>and not even risk the second one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1271
01:00:52.931 --> 01:00:55.660
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be attempting to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep the brand,</v>

1272
01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:56.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean if he has a great four years and </v>

1273
01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:00.130
<v Speaker 2>just go out with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1274
01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.013
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's always a pleasure talking to </v>

1275
01:01:02.111 --> 01:01:03.640
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that we should do this,</v>

1276
01:01:03.641 --> 01:01:05.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a little more than maybe once a</v>

1277
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.870
<v Speaker 2>year or so.</v>

1278
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.430
<v Speaker 2>And that way I can keep grading your </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictions.</v>

1279
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.273
<v Speaker 2>Is Anyone tracking you?</v>

1282
01:01:14.351 --> 01:01:15.184

<v Speaker 2>What they're doing is just track my </v>

1283

<v Speaker 2>predictions.</v>
