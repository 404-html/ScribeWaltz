00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:06.060

<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:07.770
<v Speaker 1>In case you missed it a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

4
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I had asked you guys to let me know why </v>
<v Speaker 1>I should interview you and I got to tell</v>

5
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did not disappoint me.</v>

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.083
<v Speaker 1>We got almost 1200 responses within a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week and ended up selecting 20 of you </v>

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>instead of the original five that we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>intended.</v>

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna release these over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of a couple of weeks,</v>

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.610

<v Speaker 1>interviews.</v>

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.803
<v Speaker 1>Many of you guys wrote incredible essays</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what's going on in your life and in </v>

11
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:35.094

<v Speaker 1>I promise you that we read every single </v>

12
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:38.724
<v Speaker 1>entry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took us a long time and it was </v>

13
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>incredibly difficult to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision of who to choose.</v>

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>We did our best to pick an eclectic mix </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people from all over the world.</v>

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.460

00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:00.744
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really makes putting myself out there </v>

20
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.373
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm honored really to have such an </v>

21
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:07.524
<v Speaker 1>incredible fan base that not only is </v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting with me but with each other </v>

22
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:11.874
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly you guys all recognize that </v>

<v Speaker 1>about the important issues honestly,</v>

24
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.080

<v Speaker 1>of the human race.</v>

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.153
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the first ever Rubin report fan </v>

26
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>show is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's roll.</v>

27
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on with Sophie in London.</v>

28
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Sophie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has it gone?</v>

29
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much for having me tonight,</v>

30
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:32.920
<v Speaker 2>Dave.</v>

31
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my pleasure.</v>

32
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

33
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw on twitter.</v>

34
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:37.294
<v Speaker 1>You're very excited to talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole list of things that you </v>

35
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:39.994
<v Speaker 1>had written in originally about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I sensed that more than anything </v>

36
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:44.440
<v Speaker 1>else you want to talk about feminism as </v>
<v Speaker 1>am I right?</v>

37
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My favorite topic.</v>

38
00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 2>It's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delicious.</v>

39
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's,</v>

40
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 1>let's dive right in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your feelings about feminism in</v>

41
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:54.914
<v Speaker 1>2016?</v>

42
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.933
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is feminism to 2016 isn't </v>

43
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 2>the feminism that once was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

44
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.703
<v Speaker 2>I think we know from Milo Yiannopoulos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Christina Hoff sommers who promoted </v>

45
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:08.514
<v Speaker 2>it amazingly well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea that modern feminism has </v>

46
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 2>become a kin to martin heating has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

47
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

48
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 2>and I myself having been brought up in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>family of mostly females with my dad,</v>

49
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bless his heart.</v>

50
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 2>I know the value of being a strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent woman,</v>

51
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 2>as Cliche as it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't involve safe spaces.</v>

52
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't involve shying away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

53
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it involves,</v>

54
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.660
<v Speaker 2>it involves being equal to a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It involves working to be equal.</v>

55
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.983
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything about this whole safe space </v>

56
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 2>concept is extremely dangerous because </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

57
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these students,</v>

58
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 2>universities like myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will be subject to mollycoddling to</v>

59
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 2>being told they have victims all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

60
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 2>And I imagine you're being constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>told her a victim.</v>

61
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>What is that going to change your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality that extremely damaging.</v>

62
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 2>And that is what might've modernists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism is doing to women all the time.</v>

63
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's depressing because we all meant</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be for gender equality.</v>

64
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.333
<v Speaker 2>So why are we telling these women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we telling females everywhere </v>

65
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 2>that you can't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this mystical force,</v>

66
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy is supposedly oppression </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressing us.</v>

67
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.173
<v Speaker 2>And now I say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously a patriarchy is a serious </v>

68
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 2>issue in countries such as Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 2>and India for instance,</v>

69
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 2>in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I can walk out my house without a male </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind and it's.</v>

71
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.250
<v Speaker 2>And it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

72
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have this oppression or May.</v>

73
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.443
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're telling me you're safe when </v>

74
00:03:33.321 --> 00:03:34.154
<v Speaker 3>you walk out of your house in London,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make it to the store without a </v>

75
00:03:36.831 --> 00:03:38.360
<v Speaker 3>man and you can do that on your own.</v>

76
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.503
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I do get a bit of a panic </v>

77
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:41.454
<v Speaker 2>attack coming up because I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like sometimes a wolf football's </v>

78
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.570
<v Speaker 2>gonna come at me and then I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be triggered and then it's just going to</v>

79
00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:48.080
<v Speaker 2>be horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

80
00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just manage it.</v>

81
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I just manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave.</v>

82
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.383
<v Speaker 2>And this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sad thing is is that this is </v>

83
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.700
<v Speaker 2>extremely patronizing to women and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what?</v>

84
00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:59.100
<v Speaker 2>We're for real quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we shying away?</v>

85
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:01.710
<v Speaker 2>This takes is it takes three steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>

86
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:02.783
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is ridiculous and the thing is with </v>

87
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.790
<v Speaker 2>modern day feminist feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

88
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.960
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't support men's needs as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we want gender rights,</v>

89
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.133
<v Speaker 2>gender equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to consider things that they </v>

90
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 2>aren't addressing now from what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>previously stated,</v>

91
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:19.674
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now feminist like to consider it an </v>

92
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:22.404
<v Speaker 2>oppressive force on females and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to paint it on western females as </v>

93
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:26.244
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just those that are generally </v>

94
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:27.804
<v Speaker 2>oppressed.</v>

95
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.733
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say the Patriarchy is doing a </v>

96
00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:33.930
<v Speaker 2>bloody bad job at benefiting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppresses.</v>

97
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.750
<v Speaker 2>If we look at the end endemic of male </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicides,</v>

98
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:37.584
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we look at the rates of male to </v>

99
00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 2>female ratios are going to university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the UK.</v>

100
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.303
<v Speaker 2>It's atrocious and I can't help but feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these modern day feminist fighting </v>

101
00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:51.210
<v Speaker 2>battles out already won in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

102
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:52.620
<v Speaker 2>in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.070
<v Speaker 2>you know what a pet newspaper here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK,</v>

104
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:56.904
<v Speaker 2>the Guardian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you are a big fan of these and </v>

105
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those lovely articles,</v>

106
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.253
<v Speaker 3>a little aggressive for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every now and again there's </v>

107
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.134
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

108
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.950
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always like a.</v>

109
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fairly good discussion on an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a diamond in the rough,</v>

110
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.220
<v Speaker 2>but the most part has become sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>click bait.</v>

111
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Guess what we're going to appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

112
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.830
<v Speaker 2>What sexist today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can I be a victim today?</v>

113
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.440
<v Speaker 2>And it's so disempowering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

114
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.110
<v Speaker 2>I want to read articles about women </v>
<v Speaker 2>making it in the world,</v>

115
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:25.944
<v Speaker 2>which we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we do because we are equal to men </v>

116
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:30.420
<v Speaker 2>and we should be so proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why are we shying away from that?</v>

117
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Why are we teaching these students that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.090
<v Speaker 2>men are horrible creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that I detest because</v>

119
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.003
<v Speaker 2>we are equal and when I say equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are not the same because we all </v>

120
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.330
<v Speaker 2>biologically different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

121
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:43.164
<v Speaker 2>we should be so proud of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be proud that we fill each </v>

122
00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:46.500
<v Speaker 2>other's differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We compliment each other.</v>

123
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:47.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a wonderful thing.</v>

124
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

125
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.120
<v Speaker 3>so we got to pause there because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving me a lot.</v>

126
00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:50.954
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

127
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.060
<v Speaker 3>know I'm on board most of these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what,</v>

128
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:53.894
<v Speaker 3>I promise you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to send this to Christina </v>

129
00:05:55.131 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 3>directly so she can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she can listen.</v>

130
00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

131
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you talk about these ideas,</v>

132
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 3>it's very obvious to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not just telling me this,</v>

133
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 3>this is something you talk about in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

134
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:06.284
<v Speaker 3>in your life as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you talk about this either at </v>

135
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.140
<v Speaker 3>university or with your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

136
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 3>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shawn,</v>

137
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 3>have you been fighting with people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

138
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I've been told to check my privilege </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm apparently I'm not oppressed</v>

139
00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not oppressed enough as a woman.</v>

140
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:22.754
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.793
<v Speaker 2>and apparently there are other women out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the West that has suffering </v>

142
00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:29.530
<v Speaker 2>from the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am yet to be aware of.</v>

143
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.373
<v Speaker 2>I think they should also talk to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>young working class x coal miner in </v>

144
00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:38.521
<v Speaker 2>Yorkshire who is currently suffering and</v>
<v Speaker 2>can barely afford a council flat tax,</v>

145
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these are just slight discrepancy in </v>

146
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:44.110
<v Speaker 2>that little chick and they don't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and I can totally,</v>

147
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I can totally empathize with what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to do that they're trying</v>

148
00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:49.270
<v Speaker 2>to find some good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to do something.</v>

149
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:50.104
<v Speaker 2>I can see the intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but good intentions don't always mean </v>

150
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:54.430
<v Speaker 2>good results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

151
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Hell is paved with good intentions.</v>

152
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like you say,</v>

153
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 2>I do get one a shot and I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be victimizing myself.</v>

154
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.220
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so triggered by talking about it.</v>

155
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 3>That was good to move there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have went that route but I got</v>

156
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.963
<v Speaker 3>out was good.</v>

157
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.223
<v Speaker 2>But in a sense there was a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will give them videos and say </v>

158
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Christina's talks or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

159
00:07:16.411 --> 00:07:19.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll link them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't link them to Milo yet.</v>

160
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean I adore him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like they won't get him quite</v>

161
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:24.520
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baby steps,</v>

162
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:25.354
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

163
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.243
<v Speaker 2>I'm all linkedin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say Peer reviewed studies suggesting </v>

164
00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:29.770
<v Speaker 2>perhaps like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:07:29.771 --> 00:07:30.604
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pay wage gap has nothing to do with </v>

166
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:32.384
<v Speaker 2>the mystical patriarchy but is nearly to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with job preferences as one of the </v>

167
00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:38.110
<v Speaker 2>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they will just dismiss it as saying,</v>

168
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:40.120
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a one off case,</v>

169
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.870
<v Speaker 2>but how many one off cases can you use </v>
<v Speaker 2>as an excuse for that?</v>

170
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.310
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

171
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:46.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straw Manning,</v>

172
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.670
<v Speaker 2>so to say the least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

173
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.523
<v Speaker 2>and they're trying to fight a battle </v>
<v Speaker 2>which has already been won as many as </v>

174
00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Christina has already said many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>

175
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that goes to the,</v>

176
00:07:54.961 --> 00:07:56.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feelings over facts,</v>

177
00:07:56.611 --> 00:07:59.850
<v Speaker 3>idea that seems to be what comes out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>

178
00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:01.470
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the left these days.</v>

179
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.023
<v Speaker 2>It is sad and it's sad because as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>as we used the aggressive black men </v>

180
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.100
<v Speaker 2>trope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

181
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.870
<v Speaker 2>And it's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very true.</v>

182
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trying not to think that it's most the</v>

183
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.750
<v Speaker 2>left because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much a liberal and ideas.</v>

184
00:08:15.751 --> 00:08:17.910
<v Speaker 2>I believe I believe in equality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in gay marriage.</v>

185
00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:20.130
<v Speaker 2>I believe all of that and I believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of expression,</v>

186
00:08:20.131 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I believe in exchange of ideas and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly believe with freedom,</v>

187
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.160
<v Speaker 2>with free exchange of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

188
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.780
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can empathize with people,</v>

189
00:08:27.781 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 2>you can see why people think the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think and there's,</v>

190
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.940
<v Speaker 2>there's this hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this tension because you're able</v>

191
00:08:32.941 --> 00:08:33.774
<v Speaker 2>to understand one another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is ultimately an amazing thing to </v>

192
00:08:36.121 --> 00:08:36.954
<v Speaker 2>do in such a globalized world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard to do that when you just </v>

193
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.190
<v Speaker 2>focus solely on emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not logic and rationality,</v>

194
00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:45.840
<v Speaker 2>because then you can misinterpret </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

195
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.970
<v Speaker 2>You can say it's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say it's bigoted.</v>

196
00:08:47.971 --> 00:08:48.804
<v Speaker 2>When it's perfectly innocent statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a statistic that is </v>

197
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.660
<v Speaker 2>suddenly magically turned out to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

198
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are</v>

199
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.650
<v Speaker 2>preaching you my logic or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just mangled that one.</v>

200
00:09:00.651 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I think you could be my new cohost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

201
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to shift to one more with you.</v>

202
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you mentioned in your submission that</v>

203
00:09:08.151 --> 00:09:12.350
<v Speaker 2>there is a form of atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also a that you don't like.</v>

204
00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.110
<v Speaker 2>And now I've had a lot of atheists on </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

205
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.953
<v Speaker 2>I'm generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pro atheist and I'm pro logic and </v>

206
00:09:17.241 --> 00:09:20.480
<v Speaker 2>reason and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you think that there is that some of</v>

207
00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:23.240
<v Speaker 2>the movements so to speak has taken a </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn that you don't like.</v>

208
00:09:23.241 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Can you tell me about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course I'm an atheist myself.</v>

209
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Huge fan of the secular movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're very,</v>

210
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:31.340
<v Speaker 2>very fortunate to be living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

211
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.463
<v Speaker 2>mostly secular world with exceptions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad we are doing a lot of work </v>

212
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:35.844
<v Speaker 2>towards fixing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about do you think there is a </v>

213
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:38.574
<v Speaker 2>sinister smugness and the atheist </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement and I do think it's connected </v>

214
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:43.570
<v Speaker 2>to some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the fallout because um,</v>

215
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.673
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting how some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people swope Sarah religion for their </v>

216
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:48.504
<v Speaker 2>own ideology.</v>

217
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Ideology based on the Patriarchy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on imaginary things.</v>

218
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's very religion like so in an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an,</v>

219
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 2>in an essence suddenly swapping </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

220
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not anti religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be atheist,</v>

221
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:00.534
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not anti religion at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot to be said for </v>

222
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:05.070
<v Speaker 2>some of the cultural things and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anglican Church,</v>

223
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 2>the kingdom has given us culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's given us odd.</v>

224
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 2>It's given us an explosion of things we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't deny.</v>

225
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

226
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.510
<v Speaker 2>And so one must be careful when </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing belief,</v>

227
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.344
<v Speaker 2>which is totally fine and not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>believer and the benefits of what that </v>

228
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:20.470
<v Speaker 2>belief has given us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

229
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.670
<v Speaker 2>but I do also think that some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people go get a very Marxist route,</v>

230
00:10:24.671 --> 00:10:25.504
<v Speaker 2>so they do believe that religion is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opiate of the people say and they </v>

231
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:29.910
<v Speaker 2>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

232
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 2>exchange logic and reason for their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>

233
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.563
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm an atheist because an atheist </v>

234
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:38.210
<v Speaker 2>because they've discovered science or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

235
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read more Dawkins,</v>

236
00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:40.374
<v Speaker 2>they become an atheist sort of as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>result of the ideology through the </v>

237
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.723
<v Speaker 2>Cultural Marxism that is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetuated a lot of the academia </v>

238
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 2>nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I'm,</v>

239
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm worried about that route.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part,</v>

240
00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

241
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm perfectly,</v>

242
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.500
<v Speaker 2>perfectly joyous park at a secular </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

243
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine with me.</v>

244
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>this went by super fast.</v>

246
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Clearly we couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could have talked a lot more.</v>

247
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you want to do with your life?</v>

248
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.240

<v Speaker 3>alphabet?</v>

261
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:41.190
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of other things I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably know,</v>

262
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:42.024
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

263
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much easy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

265
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we have a lot to talk about because</v>

266
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:50.244
<v Speaker 3>we've talked a bit about Turkey on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>show and you sent us a great email with </v>

267
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 3>explaining some of your</v>

268
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 1>frustrations with Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the good things with hurricane.</v>

269
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 1>We're hearing a lot about Turkey in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news right now for a series of reasons.</v>

270
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm gonna start it there.</v>

271
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Give me just the general state of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Turkey right now.</v>

272
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little tall,</v>

273
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.753
<v Speaker 4>but I can set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was relatively easy then living in the </v>

274
00:12:15.321 --> 00:12:19.730
<v Speaker 4>region,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are still tons on human rights</v>

275
00:12:19.731 --> 00:12:21.360
<v Speaker 4>violation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure on free,</v>

276
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.293
<v Speaker 4>stress free and we also have a massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>refugee crisis and is create sacred </v>

277
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.300
<v Speaker 4>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>economical and social problems.</v>

278
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 4>And also we have a really polarized </v>
<v Speaker 4>country like the,</v>

279
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:37.763
<v Speaker 4>there are many different social and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultural groups that have different </v>

280
00:12:41.091 --> 00:12:44.040
<v Speaker 4>lifestyles and values and expectations </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the line.</v>

281
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.303
<v Speaker 4>And finally we have within our sites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a internal conflict for done a </v>

282
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.873
<v Speaker 4>lot on how to use the cards and terms </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it blurs the line between the </v>

283
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.520
<v Speaker 4>Islamic center,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the center line lies,</v>

284
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.810
<v Speaker 4>and some second Turks stand together </v>
<v Speaker 4>against the careless.</v>

285
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:03.890
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume you.</v>

286
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Are you totally secular or are you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist?</v>

287
00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Are you religious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you Muslim?</v>

288
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Some combination thereof.</v>

289
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.560
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made this and I'm,</v>

290
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally values.</v>

291
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

292
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:19.813
<v Speaker 1>Can you be openly atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openly secular there because it sounds </v>

293
00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:23.594
<v Speaker 1>like the prime minister has sort of been</v>
<v Speaker 1>cracking down on or he's making the </v>

294
00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:29.330
<v Speaker 1>country more Islamist in a sense.</v>

295
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.640
<v Speaker 4>Why did he tried his best and he has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>great support.</v>

296
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.830
<v Speaker 4>His name bidding every single election </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he was getting into,</v>

297
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.400
<v Speaker 4>he had been getting into for 14 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has half the every time.</v>

298
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.690
<v Speaker 4>And also we had another becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nationalist party and upon on like,</v>

299
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.970
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

300
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say that we have roughly been pulled off</v>

301
00:13:56.671 --> 00:13:57.504
<v Speaker 4>the population that are sexually and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>secular values that have second </v>

302
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.870
<v Speaker 4>lifestyles sad that Turkey is 99 percent</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine Muslim and that kind of stuff.</v>

303
00:14:09.861 --> 00:14:13.120
<v Speaker 4>But I think it's less than this and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a monster.</v>

304
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.643
<v Speaker 4>A atheist community is getting bigger </v>
<v Speaker 4>and bigger and bigger every day and </v>

305
00:14:17.371 --> 00:14:22.371
<v Speaker 4>people are understanding that secular </v>
<v Speaker 4>values are really important for us.</v>

306
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really interesting because,</v>

307
00:14:25.341 --> 00:14:26.174
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hear from people in the West all the </v>

308
00:14:27.051 --> 00:14:29.660
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always use Turkey as the example of</v>

309
00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:31.070
<v Speaker 1>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 1>a good Muslim country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.480
<v Speaker 1>because you're okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this,</v>

312
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.910
<v Speaker 1>you have no fear about being on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

313
00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:39.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do this and you're not.</v>

314
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that Irwin is cracking </v>
<v Speaker 1>down on the press,</v>

315
00:14:42.321 --> 00:14:42.711
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

316
00:14:42.711 --> 00:14:43.544
<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>

317
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.821
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

318
00:14:44.821 --> 00:14:49.320
<v Speaker 4>I can't find it if it's a okay to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

319
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:50.154
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sometimes I feel like if I need </v>

320
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.010
<v Speaker 4>some certain stuff I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my job a success,</v>

321
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.780
<v Speaker 4>some stupid things can go badly and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of stuff.</v>

322
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:00.614
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

323
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.080
<v Speaker 4>once it entered the same time I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to speak out,</v>

324
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:04.953
<v Speaker 4>I want to be open and I went on to share</v>
<v Speaker 4>my ideas and values and I will not </v>

325
00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.250
<v Speaker 4>Stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this family's for my country and for</v>

326
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.910
<v Speaker 4>the entire university and especially.</v>

327
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

328
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.533
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly why I do the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk a little bit about the </v>

329
00:15:18.371 --> 00:15:22.120
<v Speaker 1>immigration situation because obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

330
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.013
<v Speaker 1>you share a border with Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like at some level a lot of </v>

331
00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:30.220
<v Speaker 1>the European fighters for Isis come </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Turkey to get there.</v>

332
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Then you guys get the refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then as you said you,</v>

333
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.790
<v Speaker 1>there's also this issue with the Kurds </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are sort of caught in the middle and</v>

334
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.030
<v Speaker 1>being fought on by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by both Isis and Turkey.</v>

335
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.020
<v Speaker 1>So what's the general situation as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as like integrating the immigrants?</v>

336
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.943
<v Speaker 1>Are they staying in Turkey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they just using Turkey to go to the </v>

337
00:15:47.741 --> 00:15:49.240
<v Speaker 1>rest of the Europe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

338
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.943
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no integration because millions of </v>

339
00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.570
<v Speaker 4>people keep coming to Turkey and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot shut down to boulder.</v>

340
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.210
<v Speaker 4>You cannot just say that you are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>welcoming you.</v>

341
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.373
<v Speaker 4>So we have to accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then coming by millions and like </v>

342
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.360
<v Speaker 4>data was three and there's a lot of ice </v>
<v Speaker 4>I started seeing in different cities and</v>

343
00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:22.430
<v Speaker 4>are totally like beggars on the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people living almost three years in</v>

344
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:25.220
<v Speaker 4>refugee camps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>

345
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say that like people say to</v>

346
00:16:27.691 --> 00:16:29.390
<v Speaker 4>you about Turkey is a really big </v>
<v Speaker 4>company.</v>

347
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:30.973
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Syria border is roughly thousand </v>

348
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.920
<v Speaker 4>kilometer make from me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

349
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see that.</v>

350
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:43.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel that effect of ics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then kind of Baobab.</v>

351
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 4>Sydney is in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the border suffer the most.</v>

352
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.083
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

353
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:53.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you also wanted to talk about the </v>

354
00:16:54.191 --> 00:16:56.110
<v Speaker 1>regressive left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

355
00:16:56.111 --> 00:16:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I'd say out of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of our 1200,</v>

356
00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.193
<v Speaker 1>out of our 1200 emails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say about a thousand of them did </v>

357
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.013
<v Speaker 1>have the phrase a regressive left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how has this regressive ideology </v>

358
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.440
<v Speaker 1>affected your life in Turkey?</v>

359
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 4>Talking on a TV show?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like A,</v>

360
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.620
<v Speaker 4>I keep getting angry and angry because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

361
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:27.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling blind telling countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

362
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.433
<v Speaker 4>that a hominid meant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say Turkey is a harmony between </v>

363
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:39.140
<v Speaker 4>palm tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean whenever someone criticized Islam</v>

364
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.540
<v Speaker 4>they say it's the perfect example and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you say all Muslims,</v>

365
00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:47.050
<v Speaker 4>but here is 39 to align.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're a bigot,</v>

366
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.953
<v Speaker 4>you're understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reality is much different than </v>

367
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:52.224
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there is a struggle between the </v>

368
00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.000
<v Speaker 4>centers and the Islamists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not just like,</v>

369
00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.140
<v Speaker 4>and whenever you see like something </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it on the media,</v>

370
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 4>it's presented like he's holding those </v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole stitches,</v>

371
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.010
<v Speaker 4>like there's a data and he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

372
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.463
<v Speaker 4>He has a shooting hold from society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean 50 percent of people supposedly </v>

373
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.650
<v Speaker 4>lost lumping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just support and love him.</v>

374
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:20.484
<v Speaker 4>So at the same time we have second that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's just a constant battle between </v>

375
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not just a,</v>

376
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.880
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a harmonious coexistence.</v>

377
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This keeps telling lies about it.</v>

378
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.580
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say something wrong.</v>

379
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.983
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always see someone speaking with </v>

380
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:44.020
<v Speaker 4>confidence around to villages and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of stuff.</v>

381
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.213
<v Speaker 4>But then I see people from the left in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the western countries want cherishing </v>

382
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 4>the western values in malls and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped talking,</v>

383
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.413
<v Speaker 4>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting capable of defending university </v>

384
00:18:55.841 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 4>to be random.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I can't get it.</v>

385
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.913
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with these liberals in the </v>

386
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:02.604
<v Speaker 4>West?</v>

387
00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.173
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew what was wrong with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it would solve a lot of my </v>

388
00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:09.250
<v Speaker 1>personal problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

389
00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

390
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.970
<v Speaker 1>But how big is that ideology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

391
00:19:12.971 --> 00:19:14.740
<v Speaker 1>so you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the Islamists,</v>

392
00:19:14.741 --> 00:19:15.131
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

393
00:19:15.131 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 1>we get what they're about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the secularists.</v>

394
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.993
<v Speaker 1>How big is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that piece that is this sort of </v>

395
00:19:21.701 --> 00:19:22.600
<v Speaker 1>regressive thing</v>

396
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.533
<v Speaker 4>you mean?</v>

397
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big is the regressive part?</v>

398
00:19:26.001 --> 00:19:26.834
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of trying to quiet the </v>
<v Speaker 1>secularist because we know that the </v>

399
00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Islam Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to quiet the secularist,</v>

400
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

401
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

402
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have the,</v>

403
00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 4>we don't have enough conflict to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>regressing,</v>

404
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have any real aggressive in our</v>

405
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.543
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but regressives cheap helping to Islam </v>

406
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.470
<v Speaker 4>in the West and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do not,</v>

407
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean are guns in Bangladesh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Benin in Saudi Arabia,</v>

408
00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:00.100
<v Speaker 4>a mentalist and countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are getting to that by machetes and</v>

409
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.640
<v Speaker 4>people keep talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

412

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

413

418
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.220
<v Speaker 4>even though I'm living in Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was pulled into.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

435
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:08.680
<v Speaker 1>So you're the third one up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

436
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.530
<v Speaker 1>we're dancing across the globe here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know Jordan,</v>

437
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:12.543
<v Speaker 1>one of the things when I saw your email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually the only person from </v>

438
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Jordan that emailed and we never really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear anything about Jordan.</v>

439
00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:21.220
<v Speaker 1>You hear about the Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>

440
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:22.054
<v Speaker 1>everyday in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something terrible is happening in the </v>

441
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Jordan,</v>

442
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.283
<v Speaker 1>you don't hear much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The king comes here and he has a nice </v>

443
00:21:28.181 --> 00:21:29.014
<v Speaker 1>suit and looks good and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much all you hear about </v>

444
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me a little bit what,</v>

445
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:34.360
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in Jordan?</v>

446
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:35.721
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

447
00:21:35.721 --> 00:21:36.820
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

448
00:21:36.821 --> 00:21:37.654
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jordan's like the eye of the storm and </v>

449
00:21:40.221 --> 00:21:43.100
<v Speaker 5>when do you have a storm?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody speaks about the eye of the storm</v>

450
00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:43.934
<v Speaker 5>because it doesn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So all the damage is happening all </v>

451
00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:47.624
<v Speaker 5>around us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Jordan is pretty safe and nothing </v>

452
00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:51.540
<v Speaker 5>really happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

453
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:56.930
<v Speaker 5>except we keep taking in refugees from </v>
<v Speaker 5>all over and the latest numbers.</v>

454
00:21:58.551 --> 00:22:01.850
<v Speaker 5>I've looked at almost a third of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jordan's populations,</v>

455
00:22:01.851 --> 00:22:05.000
<v Speaker 5>actually refugees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including my family.</v>

456
00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.240
<v Speaker 5>We came from Palestine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

457
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.550
<v Speaker 5>after the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

458
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.150
<v Speaker 5>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

459
00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.430
<v Speaker 5>issues with Israel after the Second </v>
<v Speaker 5>World War.</v>

460
00:22:13.431 --> 00:22:17.000
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my family is included in that number.</v>

461
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.473
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have full rights to Palestinians </v>

462
00:22:21.401 --> 00:22:23.950
<v Speaker 1>and Jordan have full rights?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>

463
00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:26.950
<v Speaker 1>they can't vote in certain things or </v>
<v Speaker 1>have certain jobs or something.</v>

464
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.140
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many regulations.</v>

465
00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:34.470
<v Speaker 5>So my family has been here from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>start,</v>

466
00:22:34.471 --> 00:22:35.304
<v Speaker 5>so I'm kind of okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Palestinians who have come later do </v>

467
00:22:39.481 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 5>have some issues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially with the,</v>

468
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.640
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the legal system,</v>

469
00:22:44.641 --> 00:22:48.570
<v Speaker 5>they're not fully protected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak.</v>

470
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:49.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

471
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.210
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

472
00:22:51.211 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 1>you emailed me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

473
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:53.134
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just in the general terms of being </v>

474
00:22:56.221 --> 00:22:57.054
<v Speaker 1>able to speak your mind and not worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about government coercion or anything </v>

475
00:23:00.601 --> 00:23:02.340
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you feel pretty comfortable?</v>

476
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:04.223
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

477
00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.093
<v Speaker 5>I think I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I stopped really bothering with it too </v>

478
00:23:08.141 --> 00:23:09.400
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It start,</v>

479
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:10.263
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was really difficult to start </v>

480
00:23:11.321 --> 00:23:12.154
<v Speaker 5>speaking out and eventually you find </v>
<v Speaker 5>your own circles and at some point </v>

481
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:16.563
<v Speaker 5>there's a tipping point where you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't care anymore about the </v>

482
00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:21.910
<v Speaker 5>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

483
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.820
<v Speaker 5>you just fight for what you think is </v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

484
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.743
<v Speaker 5>And this is one of the reasons I love </v>
<v Speaker 5>your show and I love you and I admire </v>

485
00:23:29.381 --> 00:23:30.430
<v Speaker 5>you for what you're doing.</v>

486
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

487
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.480
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gave me a bunch of great stuff to</v>

488
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:35.314
<v Speaker 1>talk about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you want it to focus </v>

489
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:41.010
<v Speaker 1>on was the western apologists for Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously,</v>

490
00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:41.844
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I've spent a lot of time </v>

491
00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:45.010
<v Speaker 1>talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

492
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.400
<v Speaker 1>And I always try to separate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

493
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim people,</v>

494
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the doctrine of Islam.</v>

495
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to do as we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

496
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

497
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.233
<v Speaker 1>Do the Western apologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in a Muslim majority country </v>

498
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.320
<v Speaker 1>having to live under certain laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictated by Islam.</v>

499
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make of these people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the West that are apologizing for this?</v>

500
00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.390
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just start out by saying like,</v>

501
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.450
<v Speaker 5>even your distinction is sometimes a bit</v>
<v Speaker 5>blurry,</v>

502
00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:17.470
<v Speaker 5>like even when you separate Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 5>peoples and the doctrine of Islam.</v>

503
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.770
<v Speaker 5>I think there's still some muddy areas </v>
<v Speaker 5>in between.</v>

504
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.900
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

505
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.400
<v Speaker 5>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of us want to be nice and peaceful,</v>

506
00:24:24.401 --> 00:24:25.234
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time when you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict and you expect the other site </v>

507
00:24:29.381 --> 00:24:32.710
<v Speaker 5>to be as nice as you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's I think a bit silly.</v>

508
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:33.873
<v Speaker 5>You don't walk up to a lion with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>flower expect there'll be friends </v>

509
00:24:37.331 --> 00:24:38.330
<v Speaker 5>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

510
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.150
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

511
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.900
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

512
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.190
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the western amount apologists is,</v>

513
00:24:45.191 --> 00:24:46.024
<v Speaker 5>my problem with them is by focusing on </v>
<v Speaker 5>they miss direct the problems and the </v>

514
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.750
<v Speaker 5>issues and as if it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

515
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.340
<v Speaker 5>it's not as bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

516
00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:00.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure like people like Reza,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Aslan and the young Turks,</v>

517
00:25:00.431 --> 00:25:05.240
<v Speaker 5>sorry from bringing data,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what they practically do is the,</v>

518
00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:06.074
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the effect on the good people like </v>

519
00:25:08.981 --> 00:25:09.814
<v Speaker 5>yourself and like the classical liberals</v>
<v Speaker 5>or whoever is genuinely caring about </v>

520
00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:16.780
<v Speaker 5>what's happening in the Middle East and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Muslim majority countries,</v>

521
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:23.580
<v Speaker 5>they take the conversation away and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>alleviates this sense of urgency.</v>

522
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.790
<v Speaker 5>They just kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you want it to help and then you</v>

523
00:25:27.791 --> 00:25:28.624
<v Speaker 5>hear someone who claims to be a scholar </v>
<v Speaker 5>and like he knows everything on the </v>

524
00:25:31.721 --> 00:25:36.290
<v Speaker 5>inside and they tell you that no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all fine then.</v>

525
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel the urge to help anymore.</v>

526
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:45.690
<v Speaker 5>And for us on the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we see this almost on a daily basis.</v>

527
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.133
<v Speaker 5>I mean female genital mutilation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>homophobia and all the terrible things </v>

528
00:25:51.671 --> 00:25:55.120
<v Speaker 5>people just genuinely dislike in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>west.</v>

529
00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.130
<v Speaker 5>These are real problems and we would </v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciate the help from,</v>

530
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from everybody.</v>

531
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.040
<v Speaker 5>We can help,</v>

532
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a way,</v>

533
00:26:04.181 --> 00:26:06.370
<v Speaker 1>so your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your in like a particularly,</v>

534
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.473
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess tenuous situation because </v>

535
00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:10.120
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're clearly,</v>

536
00:26:10.121 --> 00:26:10.954
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume you identify as a classical </v>

537
00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:12.814
<v Speaker 1>liberal or a liberal or some or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you stand for basically </v>

538
00:26:17.621 --> 00:26:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Western values I sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

539
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

540
00:26:20.411 --> 00:26:21.244
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of need the help of the </v>

541
00:26:22.961 --> 00:26:26.020
<v Speaker 1>outsiders to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make change there because it would be</v>

542
00:26:26.021 --> 00:26:27.820
<v Speaker 1>very hard to do on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

543
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.080
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

544
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:32.510
<v Speaker 5>of course to help would be much </v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciated,</v>

545
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 5>but when there is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the opposite of helping,</v>

546
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.493
<v Speaker 5>they're just not helping at all and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're actually making everyone else </v>

547
00:26:40.551 --> 00:26:41.384
<v Speaker 5>feel like there's no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no problem then well what are </v>

548
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:46.794
<v Speaker 5>you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is going to keep on </v>

549
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:51.810
<v Speaker 5>escalating until it just blows up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't,</v>

550
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:52.644
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

551
00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.653
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a tough question I think because I </v>

552
00:26:55.951 --> 00:26:56.784
<v Speaker 5>mean sure that help would be needed but </v>
<v Speaker 5>not ruining it for us would be also </v>

553
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 5>appreciated.</v>

554
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So on a day to day basis,</v>

555
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:08.550
<v Speaker 3>living in Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how much is religion affecting?</v>

556
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you religious at all?</v>

557
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any religious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

558
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

559
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.250
<v Speaker 3>So how much religious religiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religiosity,</v>

560
00:27:17.251 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 3>what's the word there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of that are you?</v>

561
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I got something close.</v>

562
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.433
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of that is affecting your day </v>

563
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:23.814
<v Speaker 3>to day life?</v>

564
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.133
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my day to day life isn't really a </v>

565
00:27:28.661 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 5>problem for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

566
00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:36.390
<v Speaker 5>if you look at other segments of society</v>
<v Speaker 5>like women or homosexuals or you know,</v>

567
00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:38.523
<v Speaker 5>any kind of a traditionally marginalized</v>
<v Speaker 5>group because Jordan is still a very </v>

568
00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:44.920
<v Speaker 5>patriarchal society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

569
00:27:44.921 --> 00:27:46.630
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Feminists in the US,</v>

570
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:48.450
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

571
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>

572
00:27:51.031 --> 00:27:53.100
<v Speaker 5>being a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you walk down the street,</v>

573
00:27:53.101 --> 00:27:55.890
<v Speaker 5>you're expected to be dressed </v>
<v Speaker 5>appropriately,</v>

574
00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:56.724
<v Speaker 5>which is pretty much covered up and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>not really strict like in Saudi Arabia </v>

575
00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:02.490
<v Speaker 5>where you have to wear the veil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like that,</v>

576
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.070
<v Speaker 5>but like don't show legs or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

577
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:10.230
<v Speaker 5>so it's kind of moderate in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

578
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 5>the religiosity is pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

579
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.553
<v Speaker 5>Like um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you always see these verses from the </v>

580
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.113
<v Speaker 5>Koran or somewhere in the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You always hear the call to prayer five </v>

581
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:23.980
<v Speaker 5>times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

582
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.330
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's part of our language.</v>

583
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.240
<v Speaker 5>We always say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might've heard this phrase,</v>

584
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.410
<v Speaker 5>inshallah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

585
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.633
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the profit always come into </v>

586
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.213
<v Speaker 5>these traditional phrases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't probably mean it to be </v>

587
00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:43.300
<v Speaker 5>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just ingrained in us and yeah,</v>

588
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:48.340
<v Speaker 5>it's just an escapable really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean it's not as bad as elsewhere,</v>

589
00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.480
<v Speaker 5>so that's some hope for us.</v>

590
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this was quick weight.</v>

591
00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:57.540
<v Speaker 3>We're basically wearing the same shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just realized it's pretty close.</v>

592
00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're in good company.</v>

593
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could go way,</v>

594
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:04.260
<v Speaker 3>way longer with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we got to go your third out of,</v>

595
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 3>out of 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a pleasure talking to you and</v>

596
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.900
<v Speaker 3>let's stay in the loop and I hope to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan one day.</v>

597
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.330
<v Speaker 5>Well you're always welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

598
00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.880
<v Speaker 5>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't tell us you're gay though.</v>

599
00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:20.040
<v Speaker 3>We'll keep it quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep it quiet door.</v>

600
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here with Felix in Germany.</v>

601
00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Felix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you dressed for the occasion.</v>

602
00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Finally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody that's looking sharp.</v>

603
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.020
<v Speaker 3>That's nice to see.</v>

604
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.230
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean you always dressed very well,</v>

605
00:29:31.231 --> 00:29:33.360
<v Speaker 6>so I thought I dressed up for location </v>
<v Speaker 6>as well.</v>

606
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You went up.</v>

607
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Me with the Thai next time maybe I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>see what I can do.</v>

608
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.313
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we got a lot of responses from </v>

609
00:29:40.351 --> 00:29:41.184
<v Speaker 3>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say after probably the United </v>

610
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:42.820
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>

611
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 1>UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe Canada,</v>

612
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:45.814
<v Speaker 1>and then India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Germany was right there in the </v>

613
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 1>top five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

614
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 1>you're the one that we selected from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

615
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:51.813
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tell me what's going on in Germany </v>

616
00:29:53.171 --> 00:29:54.004
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>

617
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.433
<v Speaker 6>I mean the biggest thing is obviously </v>
<v Speaker 6>the refugee crisis and the whole </v>

618
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.433
<v Speaker 6>political fear that is surrounding that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So kind of all it is in trouble because </v>

619
00:30:07.821 --> 00:30:08.654
<v Speaker 6>we have people who don't agree with </v>
<v Speaker 6>established politicians and established </v>

620
00:30:12.261 --> 00:30:15.500
<v Speaker 6>politicians fighting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's really interesting times.</v>

621
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've talked about it a little bit.</v>

622
00:30:17.451 --> 00:30:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Basically you guys have let in about one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point $3 million,</v>

623
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants or migrants or refugees,</v>

624
00:30:24.351 --> 00:30:25.184
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys give them some pretty great </v>

625
00:30:27.501 --> 00:30:29.060
<v Speaker 1>social services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

626
00:30:29.061 --> 00:30:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they get a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

627
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.590
<v Speaker 1>what is the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

628
00:30:33.591 --> 00:30:37.460
<v Speaker 1>is there an integration problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it more from the German side?</v>

629
00:30:37.461 --> 00:30:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Is it from their side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it both?</v>

630
00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Is it economics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

631
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:42.783
<v Speaker 6>See Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say it's not a problem with </v>

632
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:50.120
<v Speaker 6>either the Jamon locals on the migrants </v>
<v Speaker 6>or refugees themselves.</v>

633
00:30:50.121 --> 00:30:50.954
<v Speaker 6>It's a problem or systems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The government lead in all these </v>

634
00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:53.984
<v Speaker 6>immigrants who are not necessarily all </v>
<v Speaker 6>refugees because there's really no </v>

635
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.203
<v Speaker 6>proper control who gets in and who </v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't and they sought out later and a </v>

636
00:31:03.291 --> 00:31:04.124
<v Speaker 6>process that takes months until the </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole asylum application goes through </v>

637
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.540
<v Speaker 6>and then we take and one point 3 million</v>
<v Speaker 6>of them,</v>

638
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:17.110
<v Speaker 6>but there's no system to give them </v>
<v Speaker 6>shelter effectively to integrate them,</v>

639
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.183
<v Speaker 6>to teach them about the German culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what we get a lot of people bunched </v>

640
00:31:23.211 --> 00:31:27.110
<v Speaker 6>up in a really small place who come from</v>
<v Speaker 6>different cultures than our home culture</v>

641
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.423
<v Speaker 6>and then found their own little </v>
<v Speaker 6>subcultures and don't integrate very </v>

642
00:31:30.891 --> 00:31:35.300
<v Speaker 6>well because they have nobody to really </v>
<v Speaker 6>talk to except for the old people.</v>

643
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does Germany have a sort of a special</v>

644
00:31:38.761 --> 00:31:39.594
<v Speaker 1>place in this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the history with Germany and </v>

645
00:31:42.691 --> 00:31:43.524
<v Speaker 1>obviously xenophobia and World War Two </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Germany has done a tremendous amount </v>

646
00:31:46.831 --> 00:31:50.400
<v Speaker 1>to to repair that in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The culture has completely changed.</v>

647
00:31:50.401 --> 00:31:51.234
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there's a certain amount of </v>

648
00:31:53.191 --> 00:31:54.024
<v Speaker 1>guilt that you want to do the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and then they come here and then </v>

649
00:31:58.411 --> 00:32:01.230
<v Speaker 1>the systems as you're saying or just not</v>
<v Speaker 1>in place.</v>

650
00:32:01.231 --> 00:32:02.064
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the idea doesn't quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>match up with the reality of what's </v>

651
00:32:04.681 --> 00:32:05.514
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

652
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.710
<v Speaker 6>That's exactly what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Germany.</v>

653
00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:13.711
<v Speaker 6>We have a certain type of unique </v>
<v Speaker 6>political correctness and that we really</v>

654
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:19.141
<v Speaker 6>still have the shame or the guilt and </v>
<v Speaker 6>wanted to redeem ourselves basically,</v>

655
00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:23.920
<v Speaker 6>even though we are homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two generations removed from the events,</v>

656
00:32:23.921 --> 00:32:24.754
<v Speaker 6>but most Germans stove feel the need to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be proper to other people and to help </v>

657
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:30.993
<v Speaker 6>others so that the good will of helping </v>
<v Speaker 6>these people and naturally people who </v>

658
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.630
<v Speaker 6>come from civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>written areas,</v>

659
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.760
<v Speaker 6>there is a feeling off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to help them out.</v>

660
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.253
<v Speaker 6>But I think the way we are doing it now </v>
<v Speaker 6>is really failing those people in need </v>

661
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:49.760
<v Speaker 6>and have this also failing the people </v>
<v Speaker 6>locally in Germany.</v>

662
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk a little bit about,</v>

663
00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:53.493
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened on New Year's day in </v>

664
00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:55.484
<v Speaker 1>Cologne because I thought that was sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a perfect example of why this whole </v>

665
00:32:58.671 --> 00:33:02.780
<v Speaker 1>debate is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there were these massive attacks that</v>

666
00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:05.900
<v Speaker 1>mostly it sounds like they were mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>done by migrants,</v>

667
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assaulting women that were raped and all</v>

668
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:09.044
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw the reaction of the left here </v>

669
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 1>immediately was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

670
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:15.270
<v Speaker 1>this is Islamophobia and all of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that we,</v>

671
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:19.670
<v Speaker 1>we talk about endlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really it didn't have anything to do</v>

672
00:33:19.671 --> 00:33:20.510
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a group,</v>

673
00:33:20.511 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 1>if any group had attacked a whole bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of women,</v>

674
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been against that group.</v>

675
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 1>How was the reaction in Germany to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it sounded like it took a couple</v>

676
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:30.860
<v Speaker 1>of days for it actually to catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

677
00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And then people didn't really want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about it.</v>

678
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.333
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it almost took a few weeks because the </v>

679
00:33:37.061 --> 00:33:37.894
<v Speaker 6>fact that those groups who assaulted </v>
<v Speaker 6>than women were mainly immigrants was </v>

680
00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:46.840
<v Speaker 6>hidden away from the public essentially </v>
<v Speaker 6>by a political officials and police.</v>

681
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.610
<v Speaker 6>And the reaction was quite interesting </v>
<v Speaker 6>because people were really afraid.</v>

682
00:33:51.611 --> 00:33:52.444
<v Speaker 6>And really angry about the situation and</v>
<v Speaker 6>some on the left that the same as </v>

683
00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.873
<v Speaker 6>leftists in America and try to put it </v>
<v Speaker 6>away from Islam as a religion or </v>

684
00:34:03.851 --> 00:34:06.070
<v Speaker 6>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then on the right,</v>

685
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.630
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people blame Islam or Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 6>in general for that,</v>

686
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:11.464
<v Speaker 6>which is obviously also way too extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but kind of the center is missing where </v>

687
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:16.094
<v Speaker 6>we acknowledged the problem that there </v>
<v Speaker 6>are cultural differences and if you put </v>

688
00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:23.610
<v Speaker 6>young males who come from this culture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been growing up in this culture,</v>

689
00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.453
<v Speaker 6>put them in a place and just let them </v>
<v Speaker 6>have their own communities without any </v>

690
00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:32.100
<v Speaker 6>integration that these problems can </v>
<v Speaker 6>occur and we'll look you.</v>

691
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.033
<v Speaker 6>And that's where we have no solution for</v>
<v Speaker 6>it because we can't acknowledge the </v>

692
00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:37.140
<v Speaker 6>problem.</v>

693
00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with everything you've said so far,</v>

694
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:40.583
<v Speaker 1>do you guys have a particular sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of the right wing parties growing </v>

695
00:34:46.261 --> 00:34:51.261
<v Speaker 1>because because of the history of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>country that you don't want these,</v>

696
00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.920
<v Speaker 1>the Zena phobic people to actually take </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

697
00:34:55.921 --> 00:34:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we talked about all the time,</v>

698
00:34:58.141 --> 00:35:00.120
<v Speaker 1>if the left doesn't deal with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

699
00:35:00.121 --> 00:35:02.760
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost seems like the average person,</v>

700
00:35:02.761 --> 00:35:04.680
<v Speaker 1>the person that's in the middle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>

701
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.950
<v Speaker 1>well then they go to where the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer is being spoken of,</v>

702
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not something they agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

703
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.390
<v Speaker 6>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what we've been seeing.</v>

704
00:35:13.391 --> 00:35:14.224
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's always a move from the </v>

705
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:20.440
<v Speaker 6>established politicians to band,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the few very right wing parties,</v>

706
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.750
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

707
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.450
<v Speaker 6>that we'd still have in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which are really extreme,</v>

708
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:29.230
<v Speaker 6>at least some of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they always try to bend them via the</v>

709
00:35:29.231 --> 00:35:33.160
<v Speaker 6>legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But now what the channel of for Germany,</v>

710
00:35:33.161 --> 00:35:36.130
<v Speaker 6>the afd in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a new party,</v>

711
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.973
<v Speaker 6>it sprung in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All this controversy in Dave become </v>

712
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.733
<v Speaker 6>very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very big and a lot of people jump onto </v>

713
00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 6>that opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But at the same time,</v>

714
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Speaker 6>a lot of right wing extremist obviously </v>
<v Speaker 6>jumped on that.</v>

715
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:53.340
<v Speaker 6>And the established politicians all try </v>
<v Speaker 6>to pay in this new party,</v>

716
00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:54.174
<v Speaker 6>which is more conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more right wing into the Nazi Kona to </v>

717
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.910
<v Speaker 6>isolate them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then of course said you get a lot of</v>

718
00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:06.480
<v Speaker 6>extremists who join that party and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't find the real discourse.</v>

719
00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that you wrote that</v>

720
00:36:08.591 --> 00:36:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really great.</v>

721
00:36:09.701 --> 00:36:10.534
<v Speaker 1>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're starting a podcast with a </v>

722
00:36:12.611 --> 00:36:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is He,</v>

723
00:36:14.321 --> 00:36:16.330
<v Speaker 1>is he in Germany or is he in Hungary or </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else?</v>

724
00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.740
<v Speaker 6>So we just in Hungary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've impersonal.</v>

725
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.720
<v Speaker 6>We've only met once when I was at a time</v>
<v Speaker 6>where you connected through the Internet</v>

726
00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.890
<v Speaker 6>just by chance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I met him one day and we started talking</v>

727
00:36:26.891 --> 00:36:27.724
<v Speaker 6>and talking and talking and because we </v>
<v Speaker 6>both felt the need to speak out about </v>

728
00:36:32.711 --> 00:36:34.210
<v Speaker 6>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>about philosophy,</v>

729
00:36:34.211 --> 00:36:38.140
<v Speaker 6>about our societies and to discuss how </v>
<v Speaker 6>we can make them better.</v>

730
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.900
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we started having night long discussions</v>

731
00:36:40.901 --> 00:36:45.901
<v Speaker 6>literally through the night until the </v>
<v Speaker 6>sun came back up and at some point we,</v>

732
00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:47.973
<v Speaker 6>through shows like yours where you </v>
<v Speaker 6>really emphasized the need to make your </v>

733
00:36:51.881 --> 00:36:52.714
<v Speaker 6>voice heard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We decided we have to do something and </v>

734
00:36:55.151 --> 00:36:55.984
<v Speaker 6>we decided to basically start a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 6>to get other people in to discuss that </v>

735
00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:00.723
<v Speaker 6>stuff with us and to develop our </v>
<v Speaker 6>opinions openly and to kind of make a </v>

736
00:37:05.021 --> 00:37:05.690
<v Speaker 6>difference.</v>

737
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:06.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>

738
00:37:06.501 --> 00:37:07.334
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if every single person that watched </v>

739
00:37:09.051 --> 00:37:11.960
<v Speaker 1>this show started their own show and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>became completely irrelevant,</v>

740
00:37:11.961 --> 00:37:15.560
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is one I would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be happy to retire on a,</v>

741
00:37:15.561 --> 00:37:16.394
<v Speaker 1>on a farm in Wyoming or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the phrases that you used in </v>

742
00:37:19.341 --> 00:37:20.174
<v Speaker 1>your email to us was the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a global network and a local </v>

743
00:37:23.721 --> 00:37:24.321
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

744
00:37:24.321 --> 00:37:25.154
<v Speaker 1>I thought this concept was really cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's very much what we're doing </v>

745
00:37:28.281 --> 00:37:29.114
<v Speaker 1>here and it's why I wanted to do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion show and we have 20 people I </v>

746
00:37:31.401 --> 00:37:34.130
<v Speaker 1>think in 18 countries or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 15 countries.</v>

747
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.263
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can you describe what you meant by </v>

748
00:37:35.991 --> 00:37:37.100
<v Speaker 1>that concept?</v>

749
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.260
<v Speaker 6>So a lot of our local networks like </v>
<v Speaker 6>universities,</v>

750
00:37:41.261 --> 00:37:42.094
<v Speaker 6>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but cities and even countries are very </v>

751
00:37:45.101 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 6>isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

752
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.990
<v Speaker 6>we have a consensus usually in those </v>
<v Speaker 6>networks,</v>

753
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:52.540
<v Speaker 6>in universities,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in America for example,</v>

754
00:37:52.541 --> 00:37:53.374
<v Speaker 6>you have all the social justice warriors</v>
<v Speaker 6>having a real consensus and a lot of </v>

755
00:37:57.101 --> 00:37:58.430
<v Speaker 6>power,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you can't,</v>

756
00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.373
<v Speaker 6>I think as a modern human,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't rely on that to get a full </v>

757
00:38:03.101 --> 00:38:03.934
<v Speaker 6>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So these global networks that are </v>

758
00:38:05.321 --> 00:38:08.530
<v Speaker 6>enabled by the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our really Ed,</v>

759
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.610
<v Speaker 6>where you can get your ideas challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where you can get new ideas,</v>

760
00:38:12.611 --> 00:38:16.030
<v Speaker 6>where you can exchange ideas and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>where you develop the good stuff.</v>

761
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I love that.</v>

762
00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:18.414
<v Speaker 1>It's very much a concept that I believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and that I'm trying to put into </v>

763
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:22.950
<v Speaker 1>action and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to go,</v>

764
00:38:22.951 --> 00:38:24.840
<v Speaker 1>but definitely let me know when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast is up.</v>

765
00:38:24.841 --> 00:38:25.674
<v Speaker 1>Just email us again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be happy to send people over there </v>

766
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.220
<v Speaker 1>and I'll be a guest if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

767
00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.880
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would be amazing.</v>

768
00:38:30.881 --> 00:38:33.310
<v Speaker 6>It's actually up now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're on episode four now.</v>

<v Speaker 6>complicated.com</v>
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>

771
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 6>on itunes and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you want to be honest,</v>

772
00:38:41.771 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm happy to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess I am happy to send you an email.</v>

773
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.350
<v Speaker 3>You'd be the host.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be the guest.</v>

774
00:38:46.351 --> 00:38:48.000
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

775
00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:51.750
<v Speaker 3>so I am with Monica in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>France and Monica,</v>

776
00:38:51.751 --> 00:38:54.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a zillion people that emailed from</v>

777
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your bio,</v>

778
00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.653
<v Speaker 3>your bio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just where you've bounced around from a </v>

779
00:39:00.121 --> 00:39:00.954
<v Speaker 3>little bit of your family's history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was so much there that you were </v>

780
00:39:04.201 --> 00:39:05.760
<v Speaker 3>the winner from Paris.</v>

781
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.130
<v Speaker 7>Oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thanks.</v>

782
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first off just tell me,</v>

783
00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:13.660
<v Speaker 3>so you told me that you grew up with two</v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist parents,</v>

784
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:14.733
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was also colored with a Mexican </v>

785
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:20.560
<v Speaker 3>tradition and a Jewish tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you just explain some of that?</v>

786
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

787
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 7>So my mom is from Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's from a city to the north of Mexico</v>

788
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:27.303
<v Speaker 7>City and she emigrated to the United </v>
<v Speaker 7>States as a baby and my dad is of </v>

789
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.470
<v Speaker 7>Russian Ashkenazi descent and they both </v>
<v Speaker 7>met in university.</v>

790
00:39:35.471 --> 00:39:36.304
<v Speaker 7>They've always been atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>both of them and they raised me and my </v>

791
00:39:38.321 --> 00:39:39.154
<v Speaker 7>sister not to be atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but religion has never played a part of </v>

792
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:46.180
<v Speaker 7>our lives and yet we were raised between</v>
<v Speaker 7>the two cultures,</v>

793
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:49.630
<v Speaker 7>which was quite difficult growing up in </v>
<v Speaker 7>Arizona and California.</v>

794
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.970
<v Speaker 7>We were never Mexican enough to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>Mexican,</v>

795
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.470
<v Speaker 7>never white enough to be white.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it was an interesting experience.</v>

796
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.120
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm very grateful for it.</v>

797
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really cool.</v>

798
00:39:59.811 --> 00:40:02.570
<v Speaker 3>So then you bounced around pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the world.</v>

799
00:40:02.571 --> 00:40:03.404
<v Speaker 3>So can you give me like a one minute </v>
<v Speaker 3>synopsis of just where you've bounced </v>

800
00:40:05.631 --> 00:40:08.060
<v Speaker 3>around and then we'll dig into some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that you want to talk about?</v>

801
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:09.031
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sure.</v>

802
00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:14.031
<v Speaker 7>So I lived in Argentina for about a year</v>
<v Speaker 7>and 2012 after that.</v>

803
00:40:14.821 --> 00:40:15.654
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I lived in Israel for awhile and now I </v>

804
00:40:18.181 --> 00:40:21.840
<v Speaker 7>live in France,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I lived in a few different countries.</v>

805
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:22.893
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's go to some of the reasons that </v>

806
00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:25.894
<v Speaker 3>you've bounced around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you met an Israeli and you move to </v>

807
00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Israel and then you were there during </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gaza War of 2014,</v>

808
00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:34.444
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

809
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.250
<v Speaker 7>During protective edge,</v>

810
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:37.243
<v Speaker 3>protective edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So tell me a little bit about what it's </v>

811
00:40:38.751 --> 00:40:42.110
<v Speaker 3>like to be in a country that is at war.</v>

812
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:43.950
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was really scary.</v>

813
00:40:43.951 --> 00:40:46.520
<v Speaker 7>So I still remember the very first time </v>
<v Speaker 7>I heard a missile,</v>

814
00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.453
<v Speaker 7>I was watching a show on my laptop and I</v>
<v Speaker 7>heard an explosion and I didn't really </v>

815
00:40:51.421 --> 00:40:52.254
<v Speaker 7>think anything of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I heard more explosions and </v>

816
00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:57.270
<v Speaker 7>then there were sirens and I had no idea</v>
<v Speaker 7>what to do.</v>

817
00:40:57.271 --> 00:41:00.180
<v Speaker 7>I was living in a small house that </v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't have a bomb shelter.</v>

818
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.040
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

819
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.083
<v Speaker 7>I ran outside,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my neighbors told me to run into bomb </v>

820
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:08.820
<v Speaker 7>shelter next door and I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I couldn't have known.</v>

821
00:41:08.821 --> 00:41:10.800
<v Speaker 7>But then after that for the following </v>
<v Speaker 7>months,</v>

822
00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:15.801
<v Speaker 7>it just became the norm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like at least minimum seven times a day.</v>

823
00:41:16.141 --> 00:41:16.974
<v Speaker 7>I found myself in a bomb shelter and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>was an English teacher at the time and </v>

824
00:41:20.731 --> 00:41:21.564
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of our class time was spent </v>

825
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.150
<v Speaker 7>learning in bomb shelters.</v>

826
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:25.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

827
00:41:25.021 --> 00:41:28.500
<v Speaker 3>what's that like being around kids when </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is happening?</v>

828
00:41:28.501 --> 00:41:29.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're literally,</v>

829
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.680
<v Speaker 3>I assume every school they're probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>has a bomb shelter,</v>

830
00:41:31.681 --> 00:41:33.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like so the middle,</v>

831
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 3>the day you're teaching</v>

832
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.770
<v Speaker 1>and then suddenly we all have to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>downstairs.</v>

833
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.390
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the kids know the drill.</v>

834
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:42.770
<v Speaker 7>The kids are a yearly desensitized to </v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

835
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 7>It's just the norm for them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

836
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:46.184
<v Speaker 7>inside the bomb shelters we have </v>
<v Speaker 7>teaching materials and it was like </v>

837
00:41:48.951 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 7>everything just kind of kept going like </v>
<v Speaker 7>normal for them.</v>

838
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.180
<v Speaker 7>It's just part of their everyday.</v>

839
00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then okay,</v>

840
00:41:54.491 --> 00:41:55.324
<v Speaker 1>so you were there for that and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to Paris and you were in Paris </v>

841
00:41:59.351 --> 00:42:00.700
<v Speaker 1>during the Paris attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

842
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:01.873
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so Charlie Hebdo happened just months </v>

843
00:42:03.591 --> 00:42:04.424
<v Speaker 7>after me arriving and my initial </v>
<v Speaker 7>reaction was disappointment because I </v>

844
00:42:09.621 --> 00:42:14.621
<v Speaker 7>left Israel to kind of get away from all</v>
<v Speaker 7>that a danger.</v>

845
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:17.150
<v Speaker 7>And then I found myself in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 7>it again.</v>

846
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.030
<v Speaker 7>I was shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was really,</v>

847
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.353
<v Speaker 7>I felt really angry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then the way people reacted to an </v>

848
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:25.993
<v Speaker 7>attack like that in Paris was so </v>
<v Speaker 7>different than the way Israelis would </v>

849
00:42:27.911 --> 00:42:28.740
<v Speaker 7>have reacted.</v>

850
00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.930
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was really interesting.</v>

851
00:42:30.931 --> 00:42:34.110
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that basically a lot of people said,</v>

852
00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're defending Charlie Hebdo,</v>

853
00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:40.950
<v Speaker 1>but that really privately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not really what they were doing.</v>

854
00:42:40.951 --> 00:42:41.784
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

855
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.540
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there was like a protest where people</v>

856
00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:45.374
<v Speaker 7>went out in the street and they were </v>
<v Speaker 7>like holding up pencils and I didn't </v>

857
00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:50.114
<v Speaker 7>want to participate in anything like </v>
<v Speaker 7>that because I'm just thinking like the </v>

858
00:42:52.161 --> 00:42:55.610
<v Speaker 7>people who shot these cartoonists and </v>
<v Speaker 7>shot these artists,</v>

859
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.950
<v Speaker 7>we're not trying to take away their </v>
<v Speaker 7>pencils,</v>

860
00:42:57.951 --> 00:42:58.784
<v Speaker 7>like they were trying to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It has nothing to do with your ability </v>

861
00:43:03.591 --> 00:43:06.470
<v Speaker 7>to write or draw a cartoon like they </v>
<v Speaker 7>want to murder people.</v>

862
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:07.304
<v Speaker 7>So I just felt like the reaction was </v>
<v Speaker 7>very soft and I'm just very different </v>

863
00:43:11.331 --> 00:43:13.070
<v Speaker 7>than the Israeli reaction would've been.</v>

864
00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.400
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would the Israeli reaction be?</v>

865
00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:16.323
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are dealing with pretty much every </v>

866
00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:17.520
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

867
00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.161
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

868
00:43:18.161 --> 00:43:19.420
<v Speaker 7>I think we all know what the Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

869
00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.460
<v Speaker 7>reaction would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 7>would have been something.</v>

870
00:43:21.461 --> 00:43:22.294
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's probably most of the world </v>

871
00:43:23.681 --> 00:43:27.910
<v Speaker 7>wouldn't have been very happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Most of the world would protest against,</v>

872
00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:28.923
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and something that I would have </v>

873
00:43:30.131 --> 00:43:32.530
<v Speaker 7>protested against before I lived in </v>
<v Speaker 7>Israel.</v>

874
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.553
<v Speaker 7>When I went to Israel I was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't have described myself as pro </v>

875
00:43:36.341 --> 00:43:37.174
<v Speaker 7>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but now I would because it's just very </v>

876
00:43:38.981 --> 00:43:39.814
<v Speaker 7>different when you have missiles flying </v>
<v Speaker 7>over your head and if it wasn't for </v>

877
00:43:42.611 --> 00:43:43.560
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

878
00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:45.280
<v Speaker 7>iron dome interception system,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

879
00:43:45.281 --> 00:43:46.114
<v Speaker 7>they could just fall on your head and </v>
<v Speaker 7>kill you and all your friends and </v>

880
00:43:47.411 --> 00:43:50.530
<v Speaker 7>family.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it changed my perspective completely.</v>

881
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

882
00:43:51.771 --> 00:43:52.341
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

883
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:54.770
<v Speaker 1>so then you were there for Charlie Hebdo</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

884
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.640
<v Speaker 1>then the more recent attacks at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>

885
00:43:58.940 --> 00:43:59.773
<v Speaker 1>How has that changed a society because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem like that attack and then </v>

886
00:44:04.071 --> 00:44:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Brussels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

887
00:44:05.431 --> 00:44:06.264
<v Speaker 1>and then we had the thing here in San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernardino that now there is some </v>

888
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.620
<v Speaker 1>piecing this all together across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>globe.</v>

889
00:44:12.621 --> 00:44:14.870
<v Speaker 1>And I think it really felt like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>started with that one.</v>

890
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.373
<v Speaker 7>I'm from San Bernardino by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is all getting very close to home for </v>

891
00:44:19.711 --> 00:44:19.950
<v Speaker 7>me,</v>

892
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:21.210
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really are.</v>

893
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.433
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the most recent attack was a very </v>

894
00:44:29.561 --> 00:44:33.210
<v Speaker 7>unsettling same.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My,</v>

895
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.313
<v Speaker 7>I had the same feeling towards the </v>
<v Speaker 7>French reaction that I did for Charlie </v>

896
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:38.790
<v Speaker 7>Hebdo,</v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of just disappointment in the,</v>

897
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.560
<v Speaker 7>the lack of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

898
00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.860
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have like a strong reaction.</v>

899
00:44:45.861 --> 00:44:46.694
<v Speaker 7>It was more just like a soft reaction </v>
<v Speaker 7>that we have to protect people who </v>

900
00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.473
<v Speaker 7>haven't even been insulted yet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody was just worrying about </v>

901
00:44:53.901 --> 00:44:54.734
<v Speaker 7>hurting a certain group of people's </v>
<v Speaker 7>feelings instead of actually trying to </v>

902
00:44:57.921 --> 00:45:00.350
<v Speaker 7>get to the root of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

903
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.260
<v Speaker 1>How deep is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How deep is that feeling in France that.</v>

904
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.801
<v Speaker 1>Because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

905
00:45:06.801 --> 00:45:07.634
<v Speaker 1>that's what we talked about when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about this regressive ideology </v>

906
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.600
<v Speaker 1>that we care more about feelings over </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>

907
00:45:11.601 --> 00:45:14.870
<v Speaker 1>How much does that sort of seeped into </v>
<v Speaker 1>society over there?</v>

908
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.750
<v Speaker 7>I would say probably even more so than </v>
<v Speaker 7>in America.</v>

909
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:20.423
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people here are very concerned about </v>

910
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:25.410
<v Speaker 7>being politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm in a country that has a very high,</v>

911
00:45:25.411 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 7>a percentage of north Africans and </v>
<v Speaker 7>Muslims.</v>

912
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.910
<v Speaker 7>People are very careful to choose their </v>
<v Speaker 7>words.</v>

913
00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:34.360
<v Speaker 7>The media,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

914
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:38.430
<v Speaker 7>is very careful about what they say and </v>
<v Speaker 7>how they say it,</v>

915
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.353
<v Speaker 7>which is a good thing and a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I would say that now things have </v>

916
00:45:44.671 --> 00:45:46.110
<v Speaker 7>kind of died down,</v>
<v Speaker 7>honestly.</v>

917
00:45:46.111 --> 00:45:50.580
<v Speaker 7>People have kind of forgotten about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Security is very lax everywhere.</v>

918
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.473
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they still have some like emergency </v>

919
00:45:54.061 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 7>procedures in place ever since Charlie </v>
<v Speaker 7>Hebdo,</v>

920
00:45:56.281 --> 00:45:59.790
<v Speaker 7>so it's been almost two years that we've</v>
<v Speaker 7>had these emergency procedures.</v>

921
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.150
<v Speaker 7>They're supposed to be in place,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but like private and public security and</v>

922
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:06.150
<v Speaker 7>Francis just not where it should be.</v>

923
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing that I wanted to talk</v>

924
00:46:08.361 --> 00:46:10.380
<v Speaker 1>to you about or that you mentioned is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>

925
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.560
<v Speaker 1>there's two things happening in France </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

926
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:15.170
<v Speaker 1>So one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the immigration situation,</v>

927
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:18.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have all these migrants coming in</v>

928
00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:22.790
<v Speaker 1>and then at the same time basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish emigration from France.</v>

929
00:46:22.791 --> 00:46:24.890
<v Speaker 1>So Jews leaving France is at an all time</v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

930
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.963
<v Speaker 1>I was actually in Israel in November and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard a tremendous amount of French </v>

931
00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.400
<v Speaker 1>being spoken there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>

932
00:46:31.401 --> 00:46:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were signs in French.</v>

933
00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.770
<v Speaker 1>All the places that were selling houses </v>
<v Speaker 1>were written in Hebrew and in French.</v>

934
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

935
00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:38.893
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there?</v>

936
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.380
<v Speaker 7>So I can't speak too much about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

937
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:45.260
<v Speaker 7>the immigration of refugees to France </v>
<v Speaker 7>because honestly,</v>

938
00:46:45.261 --> 00:46:48.110
<v Speaker 7>when you hear about it on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't affect me at all.</v>

939
00:46:48.111 --> 00:46:51.920
<v Speaker 7>I don't see them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It just doesn't play a role in my life.</v>

940
00:46:51.921 --> 00:46:53.660
<v Speaker 7>So I can't really speak on that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

941
00:46:53.661 --> 00:46:54.494
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have been very involved in the French </v>

942
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:58.123
<v Speaker 7>Jewish community,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I know how they feel about the </v>

943
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.513
<v Speaker 7>situation in France and in Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's kind of this feeling and the </v>

944
00:47:04.461 --> 00:47:05.294
<v Speaker 7>French Jewish community,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to say I'm not a victim </v>

945
00:47:08.931 --> 00:47:09.561
<v Speaker 7>hood,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

946
00:47:09.561 --> 00:47:10.394
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're very closed a network of people </v>

947
00:47:13.221 --> 00:47:14.054
<v Speaker 7>like in the Paris area and um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they always feel targeted and they feel </v>

948
00:47:18.651 --> 00:47:21.320
<v Speaker 7>like Israel is kind of like this </v>
<v Speaker 7>Eldorado.</v>

949
00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.213
<v Speaker 7>It's like this thing that they idolize </v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's like this ideal utopia that </v>

950
00:47:25.341 --> 00:47:27.300
<v Speaker 7>they all want to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

951
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.170
<v Speaker 7>strive to be a part of.</v>

952
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:30.453
<v Speaker 7>So every time there's an attack,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like the percentage of French Jews </v>

953
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:34.744
<v Speaker 7>that leave France just skyrockets.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then another interesting phenomenon </v>

954
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.533
<v Speaker 7>is that when I was in Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I met so many people who leave Israel </v>

955
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.780
<v Speaker 7>after intending to settle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're just like I did.</v>

956
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:49.600
<v Speaker 7>There's actually a word in Hebrew for </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

957
00:47:49.601 --> 00:47:50.434
<v Speaker 7>It's called Marita.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So Alia is when you immigrate to Israel </v>

958
00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:54.004
<v Speaker 7>to go live there supposedly forever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then there's even a word to describe </v>

959
00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:00.100
<v Speaker 7>leaving there forever because you just </v>
<v Speaker 7>can't handle the quality of life.</v>

960
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:02.950
<v Speaker 7>So French people encounter that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They leave.</v>

961
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.873
<v Speaker 7>I'm hoping to find this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a network of acceptance and like living </v>

962
00:48:06.941 --> 00:48:10.390
<v Speaker 7>amongst Jews just going to be amazing </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then they get there and realize that</v>

963
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.670
<v Speaker 7>they were kind of sold a dream and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 7>come back.</v>

964
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:14.023
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's sorta like the grass is always </v>

965
00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:17.240
<v Speaker 3>greener.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have it one way then you think.</v>

966
00:48:17.241 --> 00:48:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be better over there.</v>

967
00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

968
00:48:21.441 --> 00:48:22.274
<v Speaker 3>well you've given me a lot and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're plowing through all these </v>

969
00:48:24.381 --> 00:48:26.840
<v Speaker 3>interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a pleasure talking to you and</v>

970
00:48:26.841 --> 00:48:27.674
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and good luck with the rest of your </v>

971
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:30.650
<v Speaker 3>adventures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you so much.</v>

972
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.750
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on with Ferran in Canada.</v>

973
00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.613
<v Speaker 3>Aaron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you?</v>

974
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.941
<v Speaker 8>I'm good,</v>
<v Speaker 8>thanks.</v>

975
00:48:34.941 --> 00:48:35.880
<v Speaker 8>How are you doing guy?</v>

976
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:36.913
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been enjoying talking to all these </v>

977
00:48:38.391 --> 00:48:39.680
<v Speaker 3>great people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

978
00:48:39.681 --> 00:48:41.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on up in Canada these days?</v>

979
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:42.913
<v Speaker 3>How's Canada?</v>

980
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.370
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Canada's fine.</v>

981
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:49.410
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not as libertarian leanings.</v>

982
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.910
<v Speaker 8>I'd like to turn myself,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but uh,</v>

983
00:48:52.911 --> 00:48:54.280
<v Speaker 8>I'm working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

984
00:48:54.281 --> 00:48:55.870
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm uh,</v>

985
00:48:55.871 --> 00:48:56.704
<v Speaker 8>I work with a organization called </v>
<v Speaker 8>students for liberty and I'm currently </v>

986
00:49:00.191 --> 00:49:03.670
<v Speaker 8>going through training to be kind of in </v>
<v Speaker 8>charge of the,</v>

987
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.320
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Canada.</v>

988
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:11.110
<v Speaker 8>A sect of students for liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So working towards liberty.</v>

989
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:12.390
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

990
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

991
00:49:12.961 --> 00:49:13.794
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've kind of been into libertarianism </v>

992
00:49:15.541 --> 00:49:16.374
<v Speaker 3>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very close to classic </v>

993
00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:18.354
<v Speaker 3>liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really where I consider myself </v>

994
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.290
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But speaking of your political leanings,</v>

995
00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:23.124
<v Speaker 3>my producer told me just a minute before</v>
<v Speaker 3>we connected that apparently you're in </v>

996
00:49:26.491 --> 00:49:29.640
<v Speaker 3>breitbart related to something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Milo.</v>

997
00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:33.870
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just read the article this morning.</v>

998
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.113
<v Speaker 3>Can you tell me what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He literally just screamed something in </v>

999
00:49:36.201 --> 00:49:37.034
<v Speaker 3>my ear and then ran off.</v>

1000
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:40.230
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>While the name of the articles,</v>

1001
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:41.083
<v Speaker 8>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's called Chinese for trump and it's </v>

1002
00:49:43.521 --> 00:49:47.490
<v Speaker 8>basically talking about trans woman who </v>
<v Speaker 8>a,</v>

1003
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:51.050
<v Speaker 8>either like Donald Trump or support him </v>
<v Speaker 8>fully.</v>

1004
00:49:51.051 --> 00:49:55.340
<v Speaker 8>I don't fully support him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I liked him in many ways and I think</v>

1005
00:49:55.341 --> 00:49:59.810
<v Speaker 8>his presidency could in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 8>actually be helpful.</v>

1006
00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:00.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a strange place to be for a </v>

1007
00:50:01.581 --> 00:50:02.480
<v Speaker 3>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1008
00:50:02.481 --> 00:50:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Because he seems to be a big government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of a liberal guy.</v>

1009
00:50:05.151 --> 00:50:05.984
<v Speaker 3>But I think you like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like the sort of trolling </v>

1010
00:50:08.181 --> 00:50:09.710
<v Speaker 3>unpolitical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

1011
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't agree with his trade policies.</v>

1012
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:16.870
<v Speaker 8>I think that their economic 10 letter at</v>
<v Speaker 8>A.</v>

1013
00:50:16.871 --> 00:50:21.100
<v Speaker 8>I don't have a particularly strong </v>
<v Speaker 8>stance on his immigration policies.</v>

1014
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.040
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

1015
00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:25.870
<v Speaker 8>So I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't really like that.</v>

1016
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:26.783
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I read an article just the other day </v>

1017
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:32.240
<v Speaker 8>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if he comes with his president,</v>

1018
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.133
<v Speaker 8>if he becomes president,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that things like taxes to be resent and </v>

1019
00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.470
<v Speaker 8>minimum wage would.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So not that much.</v>

1020
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:44.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange place for a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't support him,</v>

1021
00:50:44.551 --> 00:50:46.210
<v Speaker 3>but there are certain parts of him that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I like.</v>

1022
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1023
00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.400
<v Speaker 3>So you gave me a lot on your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your email entry.</v>

1024
00:50:50.401 --> 00:50:51.690
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's dive right into it.</v>

1025
00:50:51.691 --> 00:50:54.090
<v Speaker 3>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a men's rights activist,</v>

1026
00:50:54.091 --> 00:50:55.380
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1027
00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.273
<v Speaker 3>So can you explain what that means </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think a certain set of people </v>

1028
00:50:58.321 --> 00:51:01.720
<v Speaker 3>get that and then another set think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>something crazy and then,</v>

1029
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.290
<v Speaker 3>but I think the bulk of people just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even understand what that means.</v>

1030
00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:06.813
<v Speaker 8>So a lot of people don't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 8>realize that they're not informed about </v>

1031
00:51:11.951 --> 00:51:12.784
<v Speaker 8>the fact that men are falling behind or </v>
<v Speaker 8>are discriminated against in many ways </v>

1032
00:51:17.381 --> 00:51:18.910
<v Speaker 8>in today's society,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in,</v>

1033
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.730
<v Speaker 8>in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in America,</v>

1034
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:23.343
<v Speaker 8>whether it's the high suicide rates,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whether it's the high rates of </v>

1035
00:51:25.121 --> 00:51:26.830
<v Speaker 8>homelessness,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1036
00:51:26.831 --> 00:51:29.530
<v Speaker 8>whether it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1037
00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.393
<v Speaker 8>men kind of getting the short end of the</v>
<v Speaker 8>stick legally nowadays with all these </v>

1038
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.020
<v Speaker 8>rape cases.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1039
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:40.230
<v Speaker 8>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

1040
00:51:40.231 --> 00:51:41.064
<v Speaker 8>and then there's domestic violence,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is also a huge problem and men </v>

1041
00:51:43.571 --> 00:51:47.350
<v Speaker 8>really don't get seen.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And the statistics on the knowledge on,</v>

1042
00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.850
<v Speaker 8>on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>on the true,</v>

1043
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:51.310
<v Speaker 8>the reality of domestic violence isn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>really,</v>

1044
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:55.950
<v Speaker 8>isn't really known to most people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I,</v>

1045
00:51:55.951 --> 00:51:56.940
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not an,</v>

1046
00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.160
<v Speaker 8>I'm more than just an advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm an activist.</v>

1047
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:05.470
<v Speaker 8>I lead a men's rights group on my campus</v>
<v Speaker 8>at Simon Fraser University and uh,</v>

1048
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:07.003
<v Speaker 8>we host monthly events inviting </v>
<v Speaker 8>different people with different </v>

1049
00:52:10.271 --> 00:52:12.100
<v Speaker 8>perspectives on men's issues.</v>

1050
00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.340
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we had Karen Straughn and uh,</v>

1051
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:16.503
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I listened to him and last month and </v>

1052
00:52:18.311 --> 00:52:21.850
<v Speaker 8>they have this coming up month.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're having a panel discussion event on</v>

1053
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:26.650
<v Speaker 8>different perspectives of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>masculinity from men going their own way</v>

1054
00:52:26.651 --> 00:52:27.484
<v Speaker 8>to mythic poetic,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which you probably don't know if you're </v>

1055
00:52:29.591 --> 00:52:30.424
<v Speaker 8>not into the man's married Merryman,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and then there's the feminist </v>

1056
00:52:32.111 --> 00:52:33.150
<v Speaker 8>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So we're going to hold up,</v>

1057
00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.090
<v Speaker 8>have a whole panel discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's really about boots on the ground</v>

1058
00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:40.750
<v Speaker 8>activism.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm really engaging with people,</v>

1059
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.793
<v Speaker 8>so I'm kind of taking the online.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm one of the people taking online's </v>

1060
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.980
<v Speaker 8>fail offline and trying to raise </v>
<v Speaker 8>awareness one on one.</v>

1061
00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:48.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think for the average person </v>

1062
00:52:49.891 --> 00:52:51.840
<v Speaker 3>watching this that doesn't know much </v>
<v Speaker 3>about these issues,</v>

1063
00:52:51.841 --> 00:52:53.370
<v Speaker 3>they're probably looking at you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1064
00:52:53.371 --> 00:52:54.204
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a trans woman into men's rights </v>

1065
00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.193
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of flips everything on its </v>

1066
00:53:00.271 --> 00:53:01.104
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that give you a certain cache </v>

1067
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:04.770
<v Speaker 3>within the community?</v>

1068
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:07.420
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that,</v>

1069
00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:12.450
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it gives me a lot of freedom to say what</v>

1070
00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:17.720
<v Speaker 8>is churn without being labeled a </v>
<v Speaker 8>misogynist or sexist or this or that.</v>

1071
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:22.450
<v Speaker 8>I said a lot of things that if some </v>
<v Speaker 8>average white guy said it,</v>

1072
00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:23.963
<v Speaker 8>he would be maligned a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think my being trans has helped a lot </v>

1073
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 8>for our club in the sense that we </v>
<v Speaker 8>haven't been protested much.</v>

1074
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.170
<v Speaker 8>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 8>while we haven't protested at all,</v>

1075
00:53:37.171 --> 00:53:38.004
<v Speaker 8>we haven't got too much backlash and I </v>
<v Speaker 8>think it's because in the kind of </v>

1076
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:44.340
<v Speaker 8>regressive mindsets,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1077
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.473
<v Speaker 8>attacking a group that's led by what is </v>
<v Speaker 8>in their minds and oppressed minority </v>

1078
00:53:49.321 --> 00:53:52.070
<v Speaker 8>would be oppressing the minority.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Even thought that.</v>

1079
00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:54.693
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're sort of like Kryptonite in a </v>

1080
00:53:55.951 --> 00:54:00.690
<v Speaker 3>way to them because because they judge </v>
<v Speaker 3>you not by your individual ideas.</v>

1081
00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:01.763
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're judging you as solely a </v>

1082
00:54:03.901 --> 00:54:04.734
<v Speaker 3>trans person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know the trans person is high on </v>

1083
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:10.830
<v Speaker 3>the oppression Olympics chart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then they can't really figure out how</v>

1084
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:13.800
<v Speaker 3>to attack you versus you're able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>protect your own ideas.</v>

1085
00:54:13.801 --> 00:54:14.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1086
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.440
<v Speaker 3>it's actually kind of genius and also </v>
<v Speaker 3>bonkers.</v>

1087
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.630
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well it's genius on.</v>

1088
00:54:18.631 --> 00:54:19.470
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>bonkers.</v>

1089
00:54:19.471 --> 00:54:20.304
<v Speaker 8>I kind of realized that very early on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I realized when I realized that the </v>

1090
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:29.450
<v Speaker 8>reality of men's issues and how there </v>
<v Speaker 8>isn't much a lot of spokespeople for men</v>

1091
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:34.350
<v Speaker 8>and men who suffer a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I realized that if,</v>

1092
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:35.543
<v Speaker 8>if not me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>who are and who better than a </v>

1093
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:38.463
<v Speaker 8>transwoman,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I realized right away the position I'm </v>

1094
00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 8>in and how I would be squandering a </v>
<v Speaker 8>really great opportunity.</v>

1095
00:54:45.301 --> 00:54:46.134
<v Speaker 8>So I totally,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I totally use my identity as a trans </v>

1096
00:54:48.471 --> 00:54:49.304
<v Speaker 8>woman to further men's rights and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>not really ashamed of it because I want </v>

1097
00:54:52.261 --> 00:54:55.530
<v Speaker 8>to help men and I want to further their </v>
<v Speaker 8>discretion.</v>

1098
00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:56.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So obviously I get the part that you've </v>

1099
00:54:58.751 --> 00:55:01.540
<v Speaker 3>sort of insulated yourself from some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the criticism,</v>

1100
00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:04.020
<v Speaker 3>but when you do get the criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1101
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 3>does it feel particularly personal to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you because you're trans and that,</v>

1102
00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:11.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to another trans person,</v>

1103
00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:12.873
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of like the thing of the </v>

1104
00:55:14.111 --> 00:55:14.944
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

1105
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:17.343
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

1106
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.460
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1107
00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:19.251
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

1108
00:55:19.251 --> 00:55:24.251
<v Speaker 8>I criticism I get from kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>regressive side.</v>

1109
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.420
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

1110
00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.900
<v Speaker 8>They don't generally try to really steer</v>
<v Speaker 8>away from the fact that I'm trans.</v>

1111
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.333
<v Speaker 8>A lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The criticism that has been launched at </v>

1112
00:55:36.371 --> 00:55:41.371
<v Speaker 8>our club haven't even recognized me as </v>
<v Speaker 8>the president then kind of try that.</v>

1113
00:55:42.661 --> 00:55:45.550
<v Speaker 8>It wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1114
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:47.063
<v Speaker 8>I mean I get criticism for being a </v>
<v Speaker 8>female men's rights activists in </v>

1115
00:55:50.231 --> 00:55:50.920
<v Speaker 8>general.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1116
00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:51.753
<v Speaker 8>there are other people could take issue </v>
<v Speaker 8>with that because it's just kind of </v>

1117
00:55:54.761 --> 00:55:57.130
<v Speaker 8>perpetuating a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1118
00:55:57.131 --> 00:55:58.630
<v Speaker 8>everyone focusing on women.</v>

1119
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.820
<v Speaker 3>Are there other women in the group?</v>

1120
00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.910
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's actually our,</v>

1121
00:56:03.911 --> 00:56:08.911
<v Speaker 8>our executive team is a three women and </v>
<v Speaker 8>one guy.</v>

1122
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:13.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really fascinating.</v>

1123
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:15.720
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1124
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:18.910
<v Speaker 8>I find women or are law,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1125
00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:19.953
<v Speaker 8>it's a lot easier for them to approach,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let's say we're titling at club does so </v>

1126
00:56:23.231 --> 00:56:24.064
<v Speaker 8>much easier for them to approach our </v>
<v Speaker 8>table and start discussing and they </v>

1127
00:56:27.791 --> 00:56:28.624
<v Speaker 8>don't fear A.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I find a lot of men are kind of a kind </v>

1128
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:33.150
<v Speaker 8>of weary,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1129
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.890
<v Speaker 8>they're very afraid that they're going </v>
<v Speaker 8>to be judged as a certain,</v>

1130
00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:36.773
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as they're going to be judged as </v>

1131
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:38.344
<v Speaker 8>misogynistic or sexist or why are you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why are you associating with those </v>

1132
00:56:40.961 --> 00:56:45.510
<v Speaker 8>people?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's actually quite a bit easier to,</v>

1133
00:56:45.511 --> 00:56:47.710
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to attract women.</v>

1134
00:56:47.711 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 8>But then when I hear about the men who </v>
<v Speaker 8>are,</v>

1135
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:54.370
<v Speaker 8>who do come talk to us,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1136
00:56:54.371 --> 00:56:59.260
<v Speaker 8>the men who kind of stir up the bribery,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have quite horrible stories,</v>

1137
00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.220
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in our,</v>

1138
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.053
<v Speaker 8>from being horribly abused by their </v>
<v Speaker 8>girlfriends or having narcissistic </v>

1139
00:57:05.861 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 8>mothers and fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then I'm just,</v>

1140
00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:11.733
<v Speaker 8>I hear,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I hear already that truth of what's </v>

1141
00:57:13.271 --> 00:57:14.620
<v Speaker 8>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1142
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:16.930
<v Speaker 8>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would encourage men to,</v>

1143
00:57:16.931 --> 00:57:21.250
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to come to a protest more because we are</v>

1144
00:57:21.251 --> 00:57:23.650
<v Speaker 8>in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of a safe space,</v>

1145
00:57:23.651 --> 00:57:24.484
<v Speaker 8>if you will.</v>

1146
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:27.390
<v Speaker 3>I would say spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1147
00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:29.020
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I like,</v>

1148
00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:29.610
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>

1149
00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:34.050
<v Speaker 8>I don't like spices if that means that </v>
<v Speaker 8>you can't talk about certain things,</v>

1150
00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:38.920
<v Speaker 8>but that's not really what it means in </v>
<v Speaker 8>all contexts and more means that we want</v>

1151
00:57:38.921 --> 00:57:39.754
<v Speaker 8>malign you if you feel certain ways,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you feel angry because a lot of men </v>

1152
00:57:43.161 --> 00:57:43.994
<v Speaker 8>are angry and I understand that anger.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not going to tell them that they're </v>

1153
00:57:47.251 --> 00:57:50.060
<v Speaker 8>just misogynists and sexists.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1154
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:51.963
<v Speaker 8>they're not going to get judged.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're going to have at least an </v>

1155
00:57:53.911 --> 00:57:55.920
<v Speaker 8>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1156
00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:59.340
<v Speaker 3>It's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a safe space of ideas.</v>

1157
00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:01.860
<v Speaker 3>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a safe space of judgment.</v>

1158
00:58:01.861 --> 00:58:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Which are two different things.</v>

1159
00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:05.860
<v Speaker 8>It's an understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 8>compassionate space.</v>

1160
00:58:05.861 --> 00:58:06.694
<v Speaker 8>How about that?</v>

1161
00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1162
00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.550
<v Speaker 3>so what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's next after this?</v>

1163
00:58:10.551 --> 00:58:11.121
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1164
00:58:11.121 --> 00:58:11.954
<v Speaker 3>when you get out of school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this something that you want to </v>

1165
00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:17.270
<v Speaker 3>pursue it at a career level or are you </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in other things altogether?</v>

1166
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:19.263
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm currently finishing up my music </v>

1167
00:58:20.441 --> 00:58:21.274
<v Speaker 8>composition degree,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is completely separate from what </v>

1168
00:58:23.441 --> 00:58:24.274
<v Speaker 8>I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I actually want to go into law and </v>

1169
00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:29.740
<v Speaker 8>probably constitutional law.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But um,</v>

1170
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:31.390
<v Speaker 8>I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in,</v>

1171
00:58:31.391 --> 00:58:33.250
<v Speaker 8>in my past and law,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can,</v>

1172
00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:38.120
<v Speaker 8>I'm definitely influenced some real,</v>
<v Speaker 8>at least legal challenge,</v>

1173
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:40.980
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>where it helps men and,</v>

1174
00:58:40.981 --> 00:58:44.120
<v Speaker 8>but also just defending constitutional </v>
<v Speaker 8>rights and,</v>

1175
00:58:44.121 --> 00:58:44.954
<v Speaker 8>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>our human rights on a very basic level </v>

1176
00:58:46.961 --> 00:58:51.961
<v Speaker 8>and a kind of putting my effort into </v>
<v Speaker 8>keeping the state</v>

1177
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:55.070
<v Speaker 3>small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the libertarian part.</v>

1178
00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.860
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well listen,</v>

1179
00:58:57.861 --> 00:58:58.694
<v Speaker 3>we could obviously do a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unfortunately we gotta we gotta cut </v>

1180
00:59:00.801 --> 00:59:01.634
<v Speaker 3>it short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I really enjoyed talking to you and </v>

<v Speaker 3>talk about.</v>

1191
00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 3>There was something interesting</v>

1192
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:22.903
<v Speaker 1>right at the beginning of yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're originally from Nigeria and you </v>

1193
00:59:26.331 --> 00:59:30.050
<v Speaker 1>moved to the UK the day before nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 11.</v>

1194
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 1>So you moved on September 10th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2001.</v>

1195
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Can you describe a little bit of that?</v>

1196
00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:37.643
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

1197
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:42.090
<v Speaker 10>when I first got the news about that I </v>
<v Speaker 10>was a topical double decker,</v>

1198
00:59:42.091 --> 00:59:43.380
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the sort of British buses.</v>

1199
00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:44.190
<v Speaker 10>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What the,</v>

1200
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:45.023
<v Speaker 10>the two stage,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the two level of bosses are the top of </v>

1201
00:59:46.681 --> 00:59:50.010
<v Speaker 10>that and that's when we heard the news </v>
<v Speaker 10>about that something has happened in New</v>

1202
00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:53.260
<v Speaker 10>York and some explosion of something </v>
<v Speaker 10>about abusers.</v>

1203
00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:54.143
<v Speaker 10>And then we go home and then I sort of </v>
<v Speaker 10>saw the peaches about all of what </v>

1204
00:59:57.541 --> 01:00:00.660
<v Speaker 10>happened and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it didn't,</v>

1205
01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:04.770
<v Speaker 10>I didn't really understand the gravity </v>
<v Speaker 10>of what had happened.</v>

1206
01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.330
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I understood it was,</v>

1207
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.620
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>horrible thing.</v>

1208
01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:08.880
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and uh,</v>

1209
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.510
<v Speaker 10>many people died book,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it wasn't years,</v>

1210
01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:14.350
<v Speaker 10>so he is elated.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I sort of really understood,</v>

1211
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.031
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1212
01:00:15.031 --> 01:00:17.730
<v Speaker 10>the world has changed in any radical </v>
<v Speaker 10>way.</v>

1213
01:00:17.731 --> 01:00:22.731
<v Speaker 10>So that was sort of my,</v>
<v Speaker 10>my earliest memory coming into the UK.</v>

1214
01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.373
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so in a sense of sort of a baptism of </v>

1215
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:29.640
<v Speaker 10>fire sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1216
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Talk about a crazy time to move to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west.</v>

1217
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:35.630
<v Speaker 1>So let's back up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a little bit about growing up in</v>

1218
01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:36.371
<v Speaker 1>Nigeria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1219
01:00:36.371 --> 01:00:37.204
<v Speaker 1>what kind of family you came from and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what made you guys move to the UK or do </v>

1220
01:00:40.341 --> 01:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>or did you move by yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually on it.</v>

1221
01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:43.210
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I moving,</v>

1222
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:44.710
<v Speaker 10>I'm moving my father,</v>
<v Speaker 10>my mother,</v>

1223
01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.960
<v Speaker 10>my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 10>My mother is a nurse.</v>

1224
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:51.860
<v Speaker 10>She wasn't as many as Nigeria.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to say she because of you,</v>

1225
01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.530
<v Speaker 10>you do know we have an nhs.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1226
01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.590
<v Speaker 10>And there's a high demand for nurses in </v>
<v Speaker 10>the UK.</v>

1227
01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.390
<v Speaker 10>So she moved over to the UK about two </v>
<v Speaker 10>years before we moved to join her on.</v>

1228
01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:02.224
<v Speaker 10>My father was a journalist and used to </v>
<v Speaker 10>be an editor in oil and gas magazine in </v>

1229
01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:07.990
<v Speaker 10>Nigeria.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So we moved together and myself,</v>

1230
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.800
<v Speaker 10>my younger brother would move together </v>
<v Speaker 10>with him on and we moved basically,</v>

1231
01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:14.320
<v Speaker 10>essentially to have the best education </v>
<v Speaker 10>in the UK,</v>

1232
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.970
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>antidote our mother.</v>

1233
01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.950
<v Speaker 10>And so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1234
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.160
<v Speaker 10>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's my family.</v>

1235
01:01:21.161 --> 01:01:21.570
<v Speaker 10>It's true.</v>

1236
01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:22.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1237
01:01:22.071 --> 01:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>what was life like in Nigeria?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

1238
01:01:24.031 --> 01:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about Nigeria but we don't know</v>

1239
01:01:25.741 --> 01:01:27.530
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least here in the West or in the US,</v>

1240
01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.373
<v Speaker 1>we don't talk about Nigeria that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a little bit about what it was </v>

1241
01:01:30.131 --> 01:01:30.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1242
01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.070
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>growing up in Nigeria,</v>

1243
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:33.750
<v Speaker 10>life was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you out there with your friends playing </v>

<v Speaker 10>childhood was the best time,</v>

1246
01:01:39.621 --> 01:01:40.760
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1248
01:01:43.671 --> 01:01:46.130
<v Speaker 10>going in Nigeria growing up in Nigeria,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we had the dictator,</v>

1249
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.540
<v Speaker 10>general sunny.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I betcha.</v>

1250
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:49.180
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and he,</v>

1251
01:01:49.181 --> 01:01:51.430
<v Speaker 10>he was a very ruthless guy.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

1252
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.293
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1253
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:55.940
<v Speaker 10>ways economically embezzled a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 10>money.</v>

1254
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:57.643
<v Speaker 10>But Nigeria is a very resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They are probably the most resilient </v>

1255
01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:02.470
<v Speaker 10>people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 10>but towards me,</v>

1263
01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:19.213
<v Speaker 10>towards the time I was coming to the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he passed away and there was massive </v>

1264
01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:24.540
<v Speaker 10>parties in the streets and everything </v>
<v Speaker 10>like that.</v>

<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

1268
01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.080
<v Speaker 3>and then did another dictator come in </v>
<v Speaker 3>right after him.</v>

1269
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know the history</v>

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

1272
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:40.130
<v Speaker 10>we had the office democracy after many </v>
<v Speaker 10>years of,</v>

1273
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.730
<v Speaker 10>of going through,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

1274
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:42.623
<v Speaker 10>generals and dictates is basically.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so we had a passenger will become </v>

1275
01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:50.400
<v Speaker 10>president and he ruled,</v>
<v Speaker 10>boy,</v>

1276
01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:53.370
<v Speaker 10>he was also corrupt in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

1277
01:02:53.371 --> 01:02:56.850
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and he's also from the same tribe that I</v>

1278
01:02:56.851 --> 01:02:57.684
<v Speaker 10>am in Nigeria,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but many from my partner and Andrea </v>

1279
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.490
<v Speaker 10>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 10>my dad didn't like it because it was not</v>

1280
01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:03.324
<v Speaker 10>a fan man.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>

1281
01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:04.620
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we had that,</v>

1282
01:03:04.621 --> 01:03:07.580
<v Speaker 10>but now we were a country that's </v>
<v Speaker 10>struggling a lot.</v>

1283
01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.880
<v Speaker 10>We just had our,</v>
<v Speaker 10>our president's going to the UK for some</v>

1284
01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:16.310
<v Speaker 10>anticorruption socks and he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 10>give back some money because the country</v>

1285
01:03:16.311 --> 01:03:20.520
<v Speaker 10>has been really hammered by,</v>
<v Speaker 10>by previous regime is basically.</v>

1286
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1287
01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:22.034
<v Speaker 3>So let's flash forward to today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that you wanted to </v>

1288
01:03:24.111 --> 01:03:26.410
<v Speaker 3>talk to me about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that we've touched on the show</v>

1289
01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll just a tiny bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but brexit,</v>

1290
01:03:28.401 --> 01:03:30.080
<v Speaker 3>it's obviously huge for you guys over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1291
01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Support Brexit,</v>

1292
01:03:31.371 --> 01:03:32.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1293
01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.220
<v Speaker 10>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I am a big supporter of brexit.</v>

1294
01:03:34.221 --> 01:03:35.054
<v Speaker 10>I'm a big supporter of Brazil as an </v>
<v Speaker 10>engineer and I'm a big supporter as a </v>

1295
01:03:37.701 --> 01:03:41.120
<v Speaker 10>first generation immigrant out in </v>
<v Speaker 10>support of breast as a British citizen.</v>

1296
01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.373
<v Speaker 10>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it,</v>

1297
01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:47.120
<v Speaker 10>it rests essentially on this principle.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I asked myself this question if I was in</v>

1298
01:03:47.121 --> 01:03:50.390
<v Speaker 10>Nigeria and I found that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that the,</v>

1299
01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:51.403
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the political system was controlled by </v>

1300
01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:58.730
<v Speaker 10>another political system that was based </v>
<v Speaker 10>in Cairo in Egypt,</v>

1301
01:03:59.090 --> 01:03:59.923
<v Speaker 10>and they've made it past our laws.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They told us what to do with our fishes </v>

1302
01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:05.600
<v Speaker 10>and in our waters and all that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 10>stuff.</v>

1303
01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.810
<v Speaker 10>I'd give upset about that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'll say,</v>

1304
01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.800
<v Speaker 10>I'll say that's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We can't.</v>

1305
01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:10.943
<v Speaker 10>Nigeria's should have control over their</v>
<v Speaker 10>own laws and over their own borders and </v>

1306
01:04:16.281 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 10>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So I,</v>

1307
01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:21.730
<v Speaker 10>I look at it from a point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He's Nigerian living in Nigeria and this</v>

1308
01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.613
<v Speaker 10>happens in Nigeria.</v>
<v Speaker 10>How would I feel and tickets to the UK </v>

1309
01:04:25.551 --> 01:04:28.100
<v Speaker 10>now that is exactly what is happening to</v>
<v Speaker 10>the UK.</v>

1310
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:29.263
<v Speaker 10>We have a situation whereby we have a </v>
<v Speaker 10>European Commission that is not elected </v>

1311
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:36.530
<v Speaker 10>or passes a law that we have to abide to</v>
<v Speaker 10>and we can vote them out of office.</v>

1312
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:40.820
<v Speaker 10>So it's essentially a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 10>dictatorial system of sorts.</v>

1313
01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:41.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how much of your feelings about that </v>

1314
01:04:43.571 --> 01:04:46.870
<v Speaker 3>is fueled by just the border situation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the things,</v>

1315
01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:47.853
<v Speaker 3>I think we've done about 12 interviews </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and one of the things that almost </v>

1316
01:04:50.411 --> 01:04:51.244
<v Speaker 3>everyone has wanted to talk to me about </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Europe is the immigration stuff and </v>

1317
01:04:54.011 --> 01:04:56.320
<v Speaker 3>the border stuff and the migrant stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that.</v>

1318
01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:57.243
<v Speaker 3>So how much of your feeling is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrapped up just in that you want the UK </v>

1319
01:05:00.401 --> 01:05:02.200
<v Speaker 3>to be able to control its own borders?</v>

1320
01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:03.530
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think that's,</v>

1321
01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.393
<v Speaker 10>I think that's an,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think that's a very essential part of </v>

1322
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:11.030
<v Speaker 10>the brexit argument.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But the border,</v>

1323
01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:13.880
<v Speaker 10>the border situation is tangential to </v>
<v Speaker 10>the real issue.</v>

1324
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 10>And I guess since I'm not an indigenous,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

1325
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.950
<v Speaker 10>the way I feel about integration might </v>
<v Speaker 10>be slightly different,</v>

1326
01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:25.530
<v Speaker 10>but I have a lot of sympathy to </v>
<v Speaker 10>indigenous indigenous.</v>

1327
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.633
<v Speaker 10>We are seeing that in,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if they feel the sense that the </v>

1328
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:30.660
<v Speaker 10>country's been overwhelmed and they have</v>
<v Speaker 10>no control over.</v>

1329
01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:33.970
<v Speaker 10>So I have an appreciation and I </v>
<v Speaker 10>sympathize with that.</v>

1330
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:39.510
<v Speaker 10>My biggest problem is that if we do not </v>
<v Speaker 10>give us control of over the borders,</v>

1331
01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:43.450
<v Speaker 10>it will lead to a situation of social </v>
<v Speaker 10>tensions.</v>

1332
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.630
<v Speaker 10>And as soon as he's an immigrant and you</v>
<v Speaker 10>know,</v>

1333
01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.510
<v Speaker 10>I'm black and I in you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>

1334
01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 10>so,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

1335
01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:57.520
<v Speaker 10>so as someone who is an immigrant,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I feel like if you create so much social</v>

1336
01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:59.840
<v Speaker 10>tension within the system,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it will,</v>

1337
01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.290
<v Speaker 10>there'll be a backlash.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so my,</v>

1338
01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:03.183
<v Speaker 10>my,</v>
<v Speaker 10>my biggest worry about this whole EU </v>

1339
01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:06.373
<v Speaker 10>controller,</v>
<v Speaker 10>neal,</v>

1340
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.473
<v Speaker 10>that the control the he puts on </v>
<v Speaker 10>different nations is that it doesn't </v>

1341
01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:15.300
<v Speaker 10>allow nations to act autonomously so it </v>
<v Speaker 10>doesn't give them that sort of self will</v>

1342
01:06:15.301 --> 01:06:15.700
<v Speaker 10>to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>to,</v>

1343
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.533
<v Speaker 10>to do things and that leads to </v>
<v Speaker 10>frustration and that's what we see the </v>

1344
01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 10>rise of the far right and the far left </v>
<v Speaker 10>in Europe now.</v>

1345
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm curious.</v>

1346
01:06:23.151 --> 01:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>So as a first generation immigrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>

1347
01:06:26.571 --> 01:06:27.404
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're framing this not only from your </v>

1348
01:06:28.491 --> 01:06:29.324
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are looking at the people that </v>

1349
01:06:31.251 --> 01:06:32.084
<v Speaker 1>live there before you and sick saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have some legitimate fears or </v>

1350
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:39.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of it's not fully legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're acknowledging it.</v>

1351
01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.093
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has some of the sort of regressive </v>

1352
01:06:42.381 --> 01:06:43.214
<v Speaker 1>ideology has that affected you in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most people would probably look </v>

1353
01:06:47.541 --> 01:06:48.374
<v Speaker 1>at you and say that you're black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're an immigrant and that you </v>

1354
01:06:50.721 --> 01:06:54.590
<v Speaker 1>should be for fully open borders or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines.</v>

1355
01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:56.110
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I like to see it.</v>

1356
01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:56.973
<v Speaker 10>He's a fair minded person and I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I also like to deal with the realities </v>

1357
01:07:01.161 --> 01:07:02.290
<v Speaker 10>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So back nine,</v>

1358
01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.660
<v Speaker 10>Joanne,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm from omb in the late eighties we had</v>

1359
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:06.523
<v Speaker 10>a massive immigration from Ghana,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is an under a west African nation </v>

1360
01:07:09.771 --> 01:07:13.640
<v Speaker 10>into Nigeria because they had an </v>
<v Speaker 10>economic downturn bought that,</v>

1361
01:07:13.641 --> 01:07:17.840
<v Speaker 10>put a little pressure on,</v>
<v Speaker 10>on jobs and services in Nigeria,</v>

1362
01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.330
<v Speaker 10>and they became these chants,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1363
01:07:20.331 --> 01:07:21.020
<v Speaker 10>this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this,</v>

1364
01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.570
<v Speaker 10>this movement called gun on goat.</v>
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

1365
01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:27.290
<v Speaker 10>that wasn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a sort of a racist movement,</v>

1366
01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:28.363
<v Speaker 10>but in that I could see and appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 10>that whenever you have a massive influx </v>

1367
01:07:32.961 --> 01:07:35.000
<v Speaker 10>of immigration open,</v>
<v Speaker 10>showed immigration,</v>

1368
01:07:35.001 --> 01:07:35.834
<v Speaker 10>it's under the place.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It leads to social tensions and you can </v>

1369
01:07:38.841 --> 01:07:41.570
<v Speaker 10>look at it throughout history and </v>
<v Speaker 10>throughout everywhere in the world.</v>

1370
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:44.490
<v Speaker 10>And so we have to do with this bear the </v>
<v Speaker 10>image.</v>

1371
01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:47.300
<v Speaker 10>I'm pro immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Immigration is good,</v>

1372
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.010
<v Speaker 10>but it has to be controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It has to be sensitive.</v>

1373
01:07:50.011 --> 01:07:53.180
<v Speaker 10>But I mean it has to be at the behest </v>
<v Speaker 10>and at the will of the people.</v>

1374
01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.430
<v Speaker 10>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's going to lead to trouble.</v>

1375
01:07:55.431 --> 01:07:56.330
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and that's,</v>

1376
01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.120
<v Speaker 10>that's where I think this discussion </v>
<v Speaker 10>needs to be,</v>

1377
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.200
<v Speaker 10>to be hard.</v>

1378
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to a lot of sense.</v>

1379
01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't you on TV?</v>

1380
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:05.660
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>

1381
01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.870
<v Speaker 10>I don't speak a lot of pc stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so</v>

1382
01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:11.620
<v Speaker 1>on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that note,</v>

1383
01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let you go without saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1384
01:08:13.661 --> 01:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to let you go without </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying too crazy.</v>

1385
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>

1386
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.720
<v Speaker 3>it was a pleasure talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1387
01:08:17.721 --> 01:08:22.721
<v Speaker 3>I am on with Marcello who is in Maine in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States via Brazil.</v>

1388
01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:23.564
<v Speaker 3>Am I correct?</v>

1389
01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:24.683
<v Speaker 11>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you're right.</v>

1390
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:26.350
<v Speaker 11>I'm from Brazil.</v>

1391
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:30.890
<v Speaker 3>That is quite a move to go from Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hot and now cold.</v>

1392
01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.510
<v Speaker 3>What people are supposed to go the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1393
01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:32.780
<v Speaker 3>What are you?</v>

1394
01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:34.430
<v Speaker 11>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

1395
01:08:34.431 --> 01:08:35.264
<v Speaker 11>I actually lived before he,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Connecticut initially when I moved to </v>

1396
01:08:37.371 --> 01:08:41.180
<v Speaker 11>us.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Then I lived one year in Miami,</v>

1397
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:42.463
<v Speaker 11>so I kind of experienced them warm back </v>
<v Speaker 11>and now back in me and it was just </v>

1398
01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:47.540
<v Speaker 11>mostly for my work.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

1399
01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.880
<v Speaker 11>What kind of work do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm a physician.</v>

1400
01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:51.061
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1401
01:08:51.061 --> 01:08:51.894
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get into a little bit of </v>

1402
01:08:52.531 --> 01:08:53.670
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that actually.</v>

1403
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:54.271
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1404
01:08:54.271 --> 01:08:55.104
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss with me was how regressive </v>

1405
01:08:58.711 --> 01:09:03.711
<v Speaker 3>attitudes and this ideology had really </v>
<v Speaker 3>infected Brazil and how you saw it,</v>

1406
01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:04.973
<v Speaker 3>a change attitudes in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So can you tell me a little bit about </v>

1407
01:09:07.291 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

1408
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:12.170
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Brazil overall is a pretty hardcore left</v>

1409
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.153
<v Speaker 11>leftist country.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The culture in Brazil was taken over by </v>

1410
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:23.160
<v Speaker 11>hardcore socialist in the last about 30 </v>
<v Speaker 11>years they took over the church is the,</v>

1411
01:09:23.161 --> 01:09:25.880
<v Speaker 11>the press,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the universities,</v>

1412
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:27.230
<v Speaker 11>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they,</v>

1413
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.310
<v Speaker 11>they have this mindset of not wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 11>debate ideas.</v>

1414
01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:35.030
<v Speaker 11>So the way that they see things is that </v>
<v Speaker 11>if you're not,</v>

1415
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:38.000
<v Speaker 11>if you don't not agree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 11>then you should shut up.</v>

1416
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:43.030
<v Speaker 11>You should basically get out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And this is quite concerning because you</v>

1417
01:09:45.021 --> 01:09:50.021
<v Speaker 11>see people who had these a will to learn</v>
<v Speaker 11>and getting to debate and,</v>

1418
01:09:52.301 --> 01:09:53.134
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and I think that's how country's </v>

1419
01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.090
<v Speaker 11>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 11>how that's how ideas,</v>

1420
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:57.163
<v Speaker 11>debating ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's how we get to a Como status to a </v>

1421
01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:02.370
<v Speaker 11>place for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And when you can,</v>

1422
01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:03.320
<v Speaker 11>my language,</v>
<v Speaker 11>brother,</v>

1423
01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:04.640
<v Speaker 11>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

1424
01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:05.523
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and that's actually what caught me to </v>

1425
01:10:06.711 --> 01:10:08.000
<v Speaker 11>your show initially.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>

1426
01:10:08.001 --> 01:10:13.001
<v Speaker 11>this idea of fighting for free speech </v>
<v Speaker 11>and in Brazil basically the more skilled</v>

1427
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:15.703
<v Speaker 11>and now in la in the last 10 years I </v>
<v Speaker 11>would say there's a conservative </v>

1428
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.900
<v Speaker 11>movement surging so small as to not </v>
<v Speaker 11>empower,</v>

1429
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.823
<v Speaker 11>but at least there is another way of </v>
<v Speaker 11>thinking kind of surgery and people are </v>

1430
01:10:29.511 --> 01:10:32.550
<v Speaker 11>interested,</v>
<v Speaker 11>people are actually looking to it and an</v>

1431
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:33.271
<v Speaker 11>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Whoa,</v>

1432
01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:34.700
<v Speaker 11>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 11>this exists,</v>

1433
01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:35.180
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>like,</v>

1434
01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.470
<v Speaker 11>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that makes sense.</v>

1435
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.040
<v Speaker 11>And that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And it's very unfortunately that went in</v>

1436
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:41.180
<v Speaker 11>that direction.</v>

1437
01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:42.013
<v Speaker 3>So that's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying basically in the last </v>

1438
01:10:44.181 --> 01:10:45.014
<v Speaker 3>10 years as a result of this regressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology taking root that now </v>

1439
01:10:49.521 --> 01:10:54.020
<v Speaker 3>conservatism is bubbling up and that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what is defending free speech.</v>

1440
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.900
<v Speaker 3>It sounds a little backwards for the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>America is,</v>

1441
01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:57.853
<v Speaker 3>although right now I see that happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>here because strangely it's </v>

1442
01:11:00.111 --> 01:11:00.944
<v Speaker 3>conservatives that are defending free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech and the left that's trying to </v>

1443
01:11:02.901 --> 01:11:03.734
<v Speaker 3>stifle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really everything's kind of </v>

1444
01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:06.074
<v Speaker 3>upside down.</v>

1445
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:07.640
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I totally agree with you.</v>

1446
01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:08.533
<v Speaker 11>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm not sure if there's a direct effect </v>

1447
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:15.070
<v Speaker 11>of that or if it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

1448
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.700
<v Speaker 11>people really.</v>
<v Speaker 11>When do you read about new ideas?</v>

1449
01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:23.040
<v Speaker 11>They get interested even if they don't </v>
<v Speaker 11>agree initially,</v>

1450
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.580
<v Speaker 11>when they have had the freedom to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

1451
01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.980
<v Speaker 11>they,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so there are some thinkers,</v>

1452
01:11:27.981 --> 01:11:28.814
<v Speaker 11>some riders in Brazil that 10 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 11>started writing some stuff and that's </v>

1453
01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:35.390
<v Speaker 11>when actually I started reading more </v>
<v Speaker 11>about conservatives,</v>

1454
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:38.440
<v Speaker 11>more about America,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the free speech ideas,</v>

1455
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:43.460
<v Speaker 11>the individual rights and the dit of </v>
<v Speaker 11>you're able to see whatever you want and</v>

1456
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.190
<v Speaker 11>you're fine if you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's fine.</v>

1457
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.360
<v Speaker 11>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I like it.</v>

1458
01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.720
<v Speaker 11>And there's not the way in Brazil </v>
<v Speaker 11>before.</v>

1459
01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.140
<v Speaker 11>And I saw for example,</v>
<v Speaker 11>journalists actually,</v>

1460
01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:57.060
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>having to move away from Brazil in order</v>

1461
01:11:57.061 --> 01:11:59.010
<v Speaker 11>to be able to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that's that for me.</v>

1462
01:11:59.011 --> 01:12:01.020
<v Speaker 11>It's something unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It shouldn't happen.</v>

1463
01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say that,</v>

1464
01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I read your email,</v>

1465
01:12:03.981 --> 01:12:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't realize how bad things </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been in Brazil.</v>

1466
01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that you wrote that</v>

1467
01:12:09.801 --> 01:12:10.634
<v Speaker 1>was interesting is that you started </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting interested in conservative </v>

1468
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:16.760
<v Speaker 1>writers and that sort of helped your </v>
<v Speaker 1>awakening.</v>

1469
01:12:16.761 --> 01:12:17.594
<v Speaker 1>And now you're saying many years later </v>
<v Speaker 1>these conservative ideas are becoming </v>

1470
01:12:19.911 --> 01:12:20.744
<v Speaker 1>cool again down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who were some of the writers that you </v>

1471
01:12:22.101 --> 01:12:22.934
<v Speaker 1>were interested in?</v>

1472
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:24.423
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>initially I started reading proceeding </v>

1473
01:12:26.711 --> 01:12:29.980
<v Speaker 11>on rikers and one of them was a </v>
<v Speaker 11>philosopher called Paul offit,</v>

1474
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.680
<v Speaker 11>car carvana.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He'd currently lives in Virginia.</v>

1475
01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:36.370
<v Speaker 11>He's well known for,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well known writer in Brazil who actually</v>

1476
01:12:36.371 --> 01:12:37.204
<v Speaker 11>had to move away.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He's one of them and he lives in </v>

1477
01:12:38.381 --> 01:12:39.370
<v Speaker 11>Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 11>US.</v>

1478
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:43.600
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he's a big fighter against communism,</v>

1479
01:12:44.410 --> 01:12:47.710
<v Speaker 11>socialism in Brazil of free speech for </v>
<v Speaker 11>free speech guy.</v>

1480
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:49.143
<v Speaker 11>I started reading his stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I then started reading American writers </v>

1481
01:12:52.151 --> 01:12:53.740
<v Speaker 11>like almost soul,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

1482
01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:55.070
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

1483
01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.550
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Henry House Lit,</v>

1484
01:12:56.810 --> 01:13:00.250
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and this other guys from other countries</v>

1485
01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:03.310
<v Speaker 11>as well and from other Chicago schools </v>
<v Speaker 11>freedom.</v>

1486
01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.473
<v Speaker 11>And more recently I've been reading a </v>
<v Speaker 11>lot of things that dinesh d'souza </v>

1487
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:09.840
<v Speaker 11>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

1488
01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.240
<v Speaker 11>so there are few conservatives and they </v>
<v Speaker 11>usually disguise,</v>

1489
01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:17.950
<v Speaker 11>they defend free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they defend a free exchange of ideas and</v>

1490
01:13:17.951 --> 01:13:20.200
<v Speaker 11>some of them were actually leftist </v>
<v Speaker 11>before,</v>

1491
01:13:20.201 --> 01:13:24.320
<v Speaker 11>like a David Horowitz as a hardcore left</v>
<v Speaker 11>blackfoot cysts.</v>

1492
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.650
<v Speaker 11>Fomo Saul was a leftist and they,</v>
<v Speaker 11>when he got in contact with the ideas of</v>

1493
01:13:29.651 --> 01:13:32.440
<v Speaker 11>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they kind of Linda the other direction.</v>

1494
01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've really been doing my best to get </v>

1495
01:13:34.841 --> 01:13:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Thomas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the show,</v>

1496
01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much public stuff he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does anymore,</v>

1497
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:42.340
<v Speaker 1>but I'm working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stay tuned on that one.</v>

1498
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>

1499
01:13:43.781 --> 01:13:44.614
<v Speaker 1>so you move up here and you've already </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen the damage that these ideologies </v>

1500
01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:49.743
<v Speaker 1>have done in your home country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make of what they're </v>

1501
01:13:52.241 --> 01:13:53.770
<v Speaker 1>doing to America right now?</v>

1502
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:57.020
<v Speaker 11>It's like seeing a movie again.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

1503
01:13:57.170 --> 01:13:59.250
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and it actually changed a lot.</v>

1504
01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:00.960
<v Speaker 11>I feel like it changed a lot in the </v>
<v Speaker 11>last,</v>

1505
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:03.210
<v Speaker 11>let's say eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 11>seven years since I moved.</v>

1506
01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:04.523
<v Speaker 11>I'm not sure why,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I see happening things that I never </v>

1507
01:14:08.941 --> 01:14:10.950
<v Speaker 11>thought it would be possible here when I</v>
<v Speaker 11>moved to America,</v>

1508
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:11.900
<v Speaker 11>saw,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

1509
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:14.680
<v Speaker 11>the universities here are the best </v>
<v Speaker 11>universities in the world.</v>

1510
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:18.250
<v Speaker 11>They probably have very free environment</v>
<v Speaker 11>for new ideas,</v>

1511
01:14:18.251 --> 01:14:19.570
<v Speaker 11>for speech,</v>
<v Speaker 11>for debate.</v>

1512
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.830
<v Speaker 11>And then a window you see cases like Ms </v>
<v Speaker 11>Dot Arvizu,</v>

1513
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:24.763
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>where the professor was saying that's </v>

1514
01:14:26.881 --> 01:14:30.730
<v Speaker 11>the muscle here to shut off a student,</v>
<v Speaker 11>a student.</v>

1515
01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.480
<v Speaker 11>And then you see guys that just to stay </v>
<v Speaker 11>with guys they're interviewed,</v>

1516
01:14:34.481 --> 01:14:39.481
<v Speaker 11>they're Shapiro mile being like there </v>
<v Speaker 11>was violence against them and,</v>

1517
01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:41.980
<v Speaker 11>and they cannot even speak any morning </v>
<v Speaker 11>campuses.</v>

1518
01:14:41.981 --> 01:14:42.814
<v Speaker 11>And your see left is even leftists </v>
<v Speaker 11>powers one of the journalists who wrote </v>

1519
01:14:46.061 --> 01:14:47.980
<v Speaker 11>a book about the left shutting up,</v>

1520
01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.093
<v Speaker 3>Christina,</v>

1521
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:52.100
<v Speaker 11>Christina bars.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So even this guys,</v>

1522
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:53.240
<v Speaker 11>people are.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Wait,</v>

1523
01:14:53.241 --> 01:14:54.260
<v Speaker 11>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 11>this is not cool.</v>

1524
01:14:54.261 --> 01:14:56.150
<v Speaker 11>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 11>this is not good for anybody.</v>

1525
01:14:57.830 --> 01:15:01.250
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do in your own personal life</v>

1526
01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:03.440
<v Speaker 3>to combat this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is the example of the right</v>

1527
01:15:03.441 --> 01:15:05.930
<v Speaker 3>here and you're talking to me so that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty good.</v>

1528
01:15:05.931 --> 01:15:06.764
<v Speaker 3>But really as someone that has seen the </v>
<v Speaker 3>damage of this and you see this </v>

1529
01:15:09.501 --> 01:15:10.640
<v Speaker 3>happening now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>

1530
01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you post stuff on facebook,</v>

1531
01:15:12.251 --> 01:15:13.084
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to get stuff out there to combat </v>

1532
01:15:14.421 --> 01:15:15.254
<v Speaker 3>some of this?</v>

1533
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:16.900
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I use my facebook a lot.</v>

1534
01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:19.440
<v Speaker 11>I have a lot of American friends.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I have friends.</v>

1535
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:20.703
<v Speaker 11>I'm very political on facebook and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 11>glad that I'm still live in a country </v>

1536
01:15:23.471 --> 01:15:25.840
<v Speaker 11>that is very free,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that I'm not afraid.</v>

1537
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:26.703
<v Speaker 11>Like I was in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 11>People in Brazil are afraid of speaking </v>

1538
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:31.240
<v Speaker 11>out things against the government.</v>
<v Speaker 11>For example,</v>

1539
01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:33.340
<v Speaker 11>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>

1540
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:33.910
<v Speaker 11>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm,</v>

1541
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:35.050
<v Speaker 11>I,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I feel comfortable.</v>

1542
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.923
<v Speaker 11>So I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm very active in facebook and I </v>

1543
01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:40.990
<v Speaker 11>usually try to use the experience that I</v>
<v Speaker 11>have in Brazil and,</v>

1544
01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:43.270
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>push my American friends so they can see</v>

1545
01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:45.040
<v Speaker 11>the parallel,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

1546
01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.760
<v Speaker 11>to try to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I wouldn't be poor,</v>

1547
01:15:47.761 --> 01:15:49.230
<v Speaker 11>but just the American going directions.</v>

1548
01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:50.663
<v Speaker 3>Do you have American friends that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>friending you yet and blocking you and </v>

1549
01:15:53.101 --> 01:15:58.101
<v Speaker 3>all that kind of keep track of them I </v>
<v Speaker 3>guess.</v>

1550
01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:00.160
<v Speaker 3>I guess in some cases you wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1551
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.921
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the other thing,</v>

1552
01:16:01.921 --> 01:16:03.510
<v Speaker 3>let's move away from politics a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

1553
01:16:03.511 --> 01:16:06.270
<v Speaker 3>although everything is political.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you mentioned that you're a physician</v>

1554
01:16:06.271 --> 01:16:07.104
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that you want us </v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk about was the free market and </v>

1555
01:16:09.710 --> 01:16:10.543
<v Speaker 3>healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1556
01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:14.050
<v Speaker 3>we don't have a ton of time left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but can you just go with that?</v>

1557
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:15.663
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>yeah.</v>

1558
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:20.410
<v Speaker 11>Basically just a short thing.</v>
<v Speaker 11>In Brazil we have free healthcare,</v>

1559
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:21.303
<v Speaker 11>meaning the government takes over </v>
<v Speaker 11>everything and that's where exactly </v>

1560
01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:26.140
<v Speaker 11>where I see people dying for lack of </v>
<v Speaker 11>basic care.</v>

1561
01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:27.243
<v Speaker 11>People waiting in lines for six months </v>
<v Speaker 11>to get an Mri when they have cancer and </v>

1562
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:32.610
<v Speaker 11>a timeline that's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

1563
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.490
<v Speaker 11>and I believe that as anything else in </v>
<v Speaker 11>life,</v>

1564
01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:39.580
<v Speaker 11>when the free market he's able to share </v>
<v Speaker 11>work,</v>

1565
01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:40.713
<v Speaker 11>it works better than the government.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So I think in that sense where you're </v>

1566
01:16:43.451 --> 01:16:46.830
<v Speaker 11>going the wrong direction.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We America has a very good healthcare.</v>

1567
01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:47.673
<v Speaker 11>We have problems that can be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We have to sit down and see what the </v>

1568
01:16:50.021 --> 01:16:52.000
<v Speaker 11>best policies to get.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

1569
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:53.343
<v Speaker 11>but I think the fundamental idea is that</v>
<v Speaker 11>we should go towards more free market </v>

1570
01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.190
<v Speaker 11>because competition makes prices go </v>
<v Speaker 11>down,</v>

1571
01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.740
<v Speaker 11>makes things more available services </v>
<v Speaker 11>more available.</v>

1572
01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:07.040
<v Speaker 11>I wanted a system that gives us iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 11>new TV,</v>

1573
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:08.583
<v Speaker 11>new cars for cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't want a system where she did my </v>

1574
01:17:11.481 --> 01:17:14.270
<v Speaker 11>healthcare to bureaucrats who spend </v>
<v Speaker 11>$1,000,000,000</v>

1575
01:17:14.271 --> 01:17:15.950
<v Speaker 11>should make a website that doesn't work.</v>

1576
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for you in the,</v>

1577
01:17:18.391 --> 01:17:23.391
<v Speaker 3>in the personal sense as a physician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how have you seen the healthcare economy</v>

1578
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.333
<v Speaker 3>changing the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's obviously changed hugely in </v>

1579
01:17:26.661 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 3>the last three years alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What have you seen firsthand?</v>

1580
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:30.303
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I,</v>

1581
01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:32.110
<v Speaker 11>I work in a hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I hear it,</v>

1582
01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.600
<v Speaker 11>I think at the hospital up,</v>
<v Speaker 11>haven't we hadn't had the,</v>

1583
01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:37.630
<v Speaker 11>the,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the hip from obamacare yet,</v>

1584
01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:40.980
<v Speaker 11>but I see a lot of people who work as an</v>
<v Speaker 11>office outside with,</v>

1585
01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:42.760
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>outpatient,</v>

1586
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.943
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>retiring because they just couldn't </v>

1587
01:17:44.771 --> 01:17:46.220
<v Speaker 11>handle it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

1588
01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:47.373
<v Speaker 11>I see a lot of regulations coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 11>increasing the price is because every </v>

1589
01:17:50.741 --> 01:17:54.280
<v Speaker 11>single regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 11>every single pile of new rules costs.</v>

1590
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:55.570
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so when you,</v>

1591
01:17:55.630 --> 01:18:00.630
<v Speaker 11>when you get more government in between </v>
<v Speaker 11>patients and physicians you have,</v>

1592
01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:06.560
<v Speaker 11>do you have a more cross?</v>
<v Speaker 11>So prices go up and I've even seen this,</v>

1593
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:08.183
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and we don't have the obamacare fully </v>

1594
01:18:10.301 --> 01:18:11.134
<v Speaker 11>implemented yet.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think there are more things to come </v>

1595
01:18:13.331 --> 01:18:16.240
<v Speaker 11>and then make maybe make things even </v>
<v Speaker 11>worse.</v>

1596
01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:17.913
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I ever need a full frontal lobotomy </v>

1597
01:18:20.171 --> 01:18:22.150
<v Speaker 3>because of the regressives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that something you can do?</v>

1598
01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:26.500
<v Speaker 11>I'm not a neurosurgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I don't want her to have a lobotomy.</v>

1599
01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:28.200
<v Speaker 11>I think are very good fighter for </v>
<v Speaker 11>freedom.</v>

1600
01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.193
<v Speaker 11>We need you.</v>

1601
01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.340
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

1602

<v Speaker 3>it was a pleasure talking to you.</v>

1603
01:18:31.691 --> 01:18:33.520

<v Speaker 3>but we gotta keep going.</v>

1604
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:34.783
<v Speaker 11>It was my pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Thank you so much for letting me </v>

1605
01:18:35.890 --> 01:18:36.850
<v Speaker 11>participate in a show.</v>

1606
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.300
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking with you from Switzerland.</v>

1607
01:18:39.301 --> 01:18:40.134
<v Speaker 3>Has It gone?</v>

1608
01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:41.680
<v Speaker 12>I'm pretty fine.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

1609
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:44.070
<v Speaker 12>I'm fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Thanks for having me.</v>

1610
01:18:44.190 --> 01:18:45.023
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems like the answer that someone </v>

1611
01:18:46.171 --> 01:18:48.690
<v Speaker 3>from Switzerland would give.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty fantastic.</v>

1612
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.400
<v Speaker 3>People think everything's great over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1613
01:18:50.401 --> 01:18:51.234
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1614
01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:54.030
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>life is actually pretty great.</v>

1615
01:18:54.031 --> 01:18:54.710
<v Speaker 12>So,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1616
01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:55.543
<v Speaker 12>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 12>everybody's happy around here and we </v>

1617
01:18:56.761 --> 01:18:57.594
<v Speaker 12>need to show that.</v>

1618
01:18:57.690 --> 01:18:58.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1619
01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:00.450
<v Speaker 3>I like hearing that because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1620
01:19:00.451 --> 01:19:02.250
<v Speaker 3>we talk about a lot of heavy stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the show,</v>

1621
01:19:02.251 --> 01:19:04.560
<v Speaker 3>but it's nice to know that things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>working.</v>

1622
01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:05.453
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that you mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wanted to talk about is the dreaded </v>

1623
01:19:08.581 --> 01:19:13.581
<v Speaker 3>regressive left and how their ideology </v>
<v Speaker 3>is changing society in Switzerland.</v>

1624
01:19:14.281 --> 01:19:15.114
<v Speaker 3>So go ahead.</v>

1625
01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:16.261
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1626
01:19:16.261 --> 01:19:18.990
<v Speaker 12>the regressive left in Switzerland or </v>
<v Speaker 12>the equivalent of them.</v>

1627
01:19:18.991 --> 01:19:19.824
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They're not really out there in your </v>

1628
01:19:20.941 --> 01:19:25.941
<v Speaker 12>face like in other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but the actions speak volumes of course,</v>

1629
01:19:26.341 --> 01:19:26.821
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

1630
01:19:26.821 --> 01:19:29.390
<v Speaker 12>they've always been there,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but um,</v>

1631
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:31.410
<v Speaker 12>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And I keep on staring at the party now.</v>

1632
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.920
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we recently had a case like in the tabby</v>

1633
01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:39.940
<v Speaker 12>that's just around the corner from </v>
<v Speaker 12>reality in which you don't,</v>

1634
01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:45.140
<v Speaker 12>two boys from a school from Syria with a</v>
<v Speaker 12>very strong religious background refused</v>

1635
01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.950
<v Speaker 12>to shake hands with a female teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

1636
01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:52.840
<v Speaker 12>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You heard about that?</v>

1637
01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.090
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That made news here.</v>

1638
01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:55.920
<v Speaker 12>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1639
01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:59.700
<v Speaker 12>the reason behind that was because they </v>
<v Speaker 12>didn't want to suddenly her dignity's by</v>

1640
01:19:59.701 --> 01:20:00.534
<v Speaker 12>touching her rights.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And this of course all stemmed from the </v>

1641
01:20:02.941 --> 01:20:05.760
<v Speaker 12>father who is the preaching of a local </v>
<v Speaker 12>mosque.</v>

1642
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.153
<v Speaker 12>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this a stood quite controversy here and </v>

1643
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:10.501
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1644
01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 12>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1645
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:13.260
<v Speaker 12>the reactions were huge,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1646
01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:14.123
<v Speaker 12>I mean we had to write shouting,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm all the way down that it's not </v>

1647
01:20:16.621 --> 01:20:17.340
<v Speaker 12>acceptable.</v>

1648
01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:21.500
<v Speaker 12>And the Ivr and you had left.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm playing everything down saying like,</v>

1649
01:20:21.501 --> 01:20:22.170
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's,</v>

1650
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:23.800
<v Speaker 12>it's just a handshake,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1651
01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.740
<v Speaker 12>if you want to go and do some </v>
<v Speaker 12>handshakes,</v>

1652
01:20:25.741 --> 01:20:28.690
<v Speaker 12>we can go to the streets and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's not big of the asshole.</v>

1653
01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.133
<v Speaker 12>Most of all.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They all kept on saying it's against </v>

1654
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:33.120
<v Speaker 12>loads is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>

1655
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:34.583
<v Speaker 12>But I think what noise people more and </v>
<v Speaker 12>the reason why they're so passionate </v>

1656
01:20:39.121 --> 01:20:41.430
<v Speaker 12>about the whole ot was because,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1657
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:42.983
<v Speaker 12>the decision of the school by just </v>
<v Speaker 12>tolerating that without actually any </v>

1658
01:20:45.871 --> 01:20:48.840
<v Speaker 12>article to know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>which is quite an aggressive thing to do</v>

1659
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:50.420
<v Speaker 12>now.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And uh,</v>

1660
01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:51.503
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1661
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:52.343
<v Speaker 12>of course concerns were made by the </v>
<v Speaker 12>people by seeing night and they wanted </v>

1662
01:20:55.681 --> 01:20:56.514
<v Speaker 12>to start this discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Now it's not particularly about the </v>

1663
01:20:58.681 --> 01:20:59.514
<v Speaker 12>handshake itself,</v>
<v Speaker 12>which also refused the moderates in our </v>

1664
01:21:02.431 --> 01:21:07.020
<v Speaker 12>country and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they're just asked themselves stuck.</v>

1665
01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:07.973
<v Speaker 12>They want to start a question though.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like what is an acceptable into of </v>

1666
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:15.030
<v Speaker 12>integration?</v>
<v Speaker 12>What is acceptable in terms of religious</v>

1667
01:21:15.031 --> 01:21:15.864
<v Speaker 12>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1668
01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:21.220
<v Speaker 12>and this basic as has been washed out.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But just saying like I'm saying like now</v>

1669
01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:23.070
<v Speaker 12>it's not that big a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1670
01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:25.470
<v Speaker 12>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and it also interviewed them.</v>

1671
01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:26.773
<v Speaker 12>I'm the head teacher for the school.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And he also kept on saying it's not </v>

1672
01:21:29.371 --> 01:21:30.204
<v Speaker 12>against the rules and that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I just don't want to put ourselves out </v>

1673
01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:34.350
<v Speaker 12>there too much.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>

1674
01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:37.200
<v Speaker 12>and this annoyed quite lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 12>because you know,</v>

1675
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:40.680
<v Speaker 12>the reason why they feel passionate </v>
<v Speaker 12>about this whole ordeal was not because,</v>

1676
01:21:40.681 --> 01:21:41.514
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>check itself is because the discussion </v>

1677
01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.210
<v Speaker 12>which has never been actually made,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1678
01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:47.750
<v Speaker 12>this was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1679
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:50.010
<v Speaker 12>a big deal here around.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

1680
01:21:50.011 --> 01:21:54.150
<v Speaker 12>So it's not about the actual handshake,</v>
<v Speaker 12>nobody really cares about that,</v>

1681
01:21:54.151 --> 01:21:57.000
<v Speaker 12>but it's just about the creeping idea </v>
<v Speaker 12>behind it,</v>

1682
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:58.223
<v Speaker 12>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that these boys will grow up and not </v>

1683
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.093
<v Speaker 12>necessarily respect women or treat women</v>
<v Speaker 12>as equals and then that becomes an </v>

1684
01:22:05.341 --> 01:22:06.710
<v Speaker 12>actual societal problems.</v>

1685
01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:07.543
<v Speaker 12>So it's not about a bunch of young boys </v>
<v Speaker 12>whether they shake this one person's </v>

1686
01:22:10.561 --> 01:22:13.880
<v Speaker 12>hand or not.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Well I think it was more about like,</v>

1687
01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:14.963
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what are the ground rules integration </v>

1688
01:22:16.471 --> 01:22:17.304
<v Speaker 12>here.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We just want to talk about that and we </v>

1689
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:19.644
<v Speaker 12>don't actually want to talk too much </v>
<v Speaker 12>into the future because we don't know </v>

1690
01:22:21.361 --> 01:22:22.860
<v Speaker 12>what actually would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>

1691
01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:25.290
<v Speaker 12>it was just like let's just talk about </v>
<v Speaker 12>it.</v>

1692
01:22:25.291 --> 01:22:26.124
<v Speaker 12>And at some point it was just not </v>
<v Speaker 12>possible edible and it didn't end at </v>

1693
01:22:29.851 --> 01:22:30.720
<v Speaker 12>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Actually,</v>

1694
01:22:30.721 --> 01:22:33.080
<v Speaker 12>I made the pots capitals 30 and instead </v>
<v Speaker 12>of bringing out,</v>

1695
01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:36.470
<v Speaker 12>and there was another recent case in </v>
<v Speaker 12>another city Lucerne,</v>

1696
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:39.210
<v Speaker 12>which is quite a famous this nation in </v>
<v Speaker 12>Switzerland,</v>

1697
01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:40.463
<v Speaker 12>but it was actually a dentist,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this dentist who fused to operate on </v>

1698
01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:48.420
<v Speaker 12>patients.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The patient happens to be a Muslim woman</v>

1699
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:51.840
<v Speaker 12>and she refused to give him a handshake </v>
<v Speaker 12>because it's,</v>

1700
01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:54.160
<v Speaker 12>it's just a thing she doesn't do.</v>

1701
01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.160
<v Speaker 12>He refused to operate on her because he,</v>
<v Speaker 12>his argument was um,</v>

1702
01:22:59.590 --> 01:23:00.423
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm a patient doctor relationship is </v>

1703
01:23:02.641 --> 01:23:04.830
<v Speaker 12>based on trust.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If the trust is not,</v>

1704
01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.193
<v Speaker 12>I cannot buy the best wheel and by the </v>
<v Speaker 12>best capabilities of my conscious I </v>

1705
01:23:10.061 --> 01:23:11.420
<v Speaker 12>cannot operate on her,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1706
01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.650
<v Speaker 12>although of course that this has,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1707
01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.800
<v Speaker 12>blowing up again,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1708
01:23:14.801 --> 01:23:15.634
<v Speaker 12>like people asking like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>haven't you made something like the </v>

1709
01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:20.230
<v Speaker 12>hippocratic oath or something,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know when you said like,</v>

1710
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:21.064
<v Speaker 12>yes I did.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But the only challenge with them with </v>

1711
01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.110
<v Speaker 12>emergency status,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1712
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.020
<v Speaker 12>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's,</v>

1713
01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.690
<v Speaker 12>and,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and she can choose whoever talked to she</v>

1714
01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:29.650
<v Speaker 12>actually wants,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1715
01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:34.090
<v Speaker 12>it's actually the same thing just in </v>
<v Speaker 12>opposite positions,</v>

1716
01:23:34.091 --> 01:23:34.924
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

1717
01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:38.150
<v Speaker 12>it has closed.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It has no feeling,</v>

1718
01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:38.660
<v Speaker 12>you know?</v>

1719
01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is like with us,</v>

1720
01:23:40.521 --> 01:23:41.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like these bakers that don't want </v>

1721
01:23:43.131 --> 01:23:45.410
<v Speaker 1>to bake a cake for a gay wedding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1722
01:23:45.411 --> 01:23:46.244
<v Speaker 1>what should the role of the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>be and should we force people to do all </v>

1723
01:23:48.801 --> 01:23:50.340
<v Speaker 1>this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1724
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:51.223
<v Speaker 1>so one of the other things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to talk about was the amount of </v>

1725
01:23:53.331 --> 01:23:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Americans that are moving to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland.</v>

1726
01:23:56.121 --> 01:23:56.954
<v Speaker 1>So that's a different type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration that you have going on </v>

1727
01:23:58.611 --> 01:23:59.444
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about.</v>

1728
01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:00.583
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you can see the other side of the story </v>

1729
01:24:02.221 --> 01:24:03.030
<v Speaker 12>too.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

1730
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.800
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

1731
01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:07.410
<v Speaker 12>of course the amount of Americans still </v>
<v Speaker 12>pales in comparison to the EU,</v>

1732
01:24:07.650 --> 01:24:10.500
<v Speaker 12>which the most people immigrated come </v>
<v Speaker 12>from,</v>

1733
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:14.700
<v Speaker 12>but they are quite a lot of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 12>coming here because Switzerland supplies</v>

1734
01:24:14.701 --> 01:24:19.020
<v Speaker 12>about is home to many and major global </v>
<v Speaker 12>companies.</v>

1735
01:24:19.230 --> 01:24:20.063
<v Speaker 12>And of course eventually they get a </v>
<v Speaker 12>chance to come my here and then </v>

1736
01:24:23.611 --> 01:24:24.444
<v Speaker 12>themselves next steps program.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So after someone else they can go back </v>

1737
01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:29.513
<v Speaker 12>and most of my coworkers actually </v>
<v Speaker 12>decided to stick around a little bit </v>

1738
01:24:31.861 --> 01:24:32.694
<v Speaker 12>longer because they learned to </v>
<v Speaker 12>appreciate the high wages on the </v>

1739
01:24:36.121 --> 01:24:36.954
<v Speaker 12>security.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And Nice infrastructure to before who </v>

1740
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.770
<v Speaker 12>I'm optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 12>positive.</v>

1741
01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:45.630
<v Speaker 12>Of course there are some bad things here</v>
<v Speaker 12>as well.</v>

1742
01:24:45.631 --> 01:24:46.464
<v Speaker 12>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like the depressive Sunday where </v>

1743
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:52.830
<v Speaker 12>everything is closed and the high cost </v>
<v Speaker 12>of living,</v>

1744
01:24:52.831 --> 01:24:53.664
<v Speaker 12>but usually they like the social </v>
<v Speaker 12>security network here around and stick </v>

1745
01:24:57.211 --> 01:24:58.044
<v Speaker 12>around here.</v>

1746
01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:00.390
<v Speaker 12>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I think is.</v>

1747
01:25:00.391 --> 01:25:02.610
<v Speaker 12>I have to tell you a little story,</v>
<v Speaker 12>sorry about that.</v>

1748
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:04.610
<v Speaker 12>We're also,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1749
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:07.560
<v Speaker 12>a household.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We speak a couple of languages,</v>

1750
01:25:07.561 --> 01:25:08.394
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>
<v Speaker 12>And we speak also English and before my </v>

1751
01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:12.590
<v Speaker 12>tall to enter the kingdom hall.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And she actually,</v>

1752
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.290
<v Speaker 12>we had to fill out the form explaining </v>
<v Speaker 12>how good the German was actually.</v>

1753
01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.810
<v Speaker 12>So the oldest so she can keep up in </v>
<v Speaker 12>school,</v>

1754
01:25:18.811 --> 01:25:20.560
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I was just actually,</v>

1755
01:25:20.561 --> 01:25:21.231
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>yeah,</v>

1756
01:25:21.231 --> 01:25:22.620
<v Speaker 12>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's a sensible thing to do.</v>

1757
01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:23.873
<v Speaker 12>And now after the signing of the letter </v>
<v Speaker 12>I received from the Department of </v>

1758
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:27.900
<v Speaker 12>Education,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I received a letter,</v>

1759
01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.650
<v Speaker 12>an annual let's actually demanding for </v>
<v Speaker 12>me to organize the German classes.</v>

1760
01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:32.963
<v Speaker 12>And of course I was actually surprised I</v>
<v Speaker 12>was calling up and asking what's the </v>

1761
01:25:36.991 --> 01:25:37.824
<v Speaker 12>reasoning behind this?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Because I do speak Swiss German pretty </v>

1762
01:25:39.421 --> 01:25:42.980
<v Speaker 12>well actually.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm not bidding cities in consumables.</v>

1763
01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:44.880
<v Speaker 12>And she actually was very surprised.</v>

1764
01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.810
<v Speaker 12>He thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Oh yeah,</v>

1765
01:25:45.811 --> 01:25:46.400
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm,</v>

1766
01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.233
<v Speaker 12>I'm sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mistook it for someone else because </v>

1767
01:25:49.681 --> 01:25:50.514
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there are some people who have more </v>

1768
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:53.150
<v Speaker 12>issues and I've thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

1769
01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.290
<v Speaker 12>I my name,</v>
<v Speaker 12>age.</v>

1770
01:25:55.291 --> 01:25:56.124
<v Speaker 12>No,</v>
<v Speaker 12>maybe she thought about Asian people </v>

1771
01:25:57.211 --> 01:26:01.020
<v Speaker 12>will do actually have some difficulties </v>
<v Speaker 12>learning switch because it's bad.</v>

1772
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:02.770
<v Speaker 12>And she told me,</v>
<v Speaker 12>actually no,</v>

1773
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:07.610
<v Speaker 12>I thought your American,</v>
<v Speaker 12>because I'm American American,</v>

1774
01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.740
<v Speaker 12>she told me private,</v>
<v Speaker 12>of course the American,</v>

1775
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:10.783
<v Speaker 12>a lot of those people have most </v>
<v Speaker 12>difficulties willing to have most </v>

1776
01:26:15.411 --> 01:26:19.790
<v Speaker 12>difficulties and to want students with </v>
<v Speaker 12>German actually because I'm.</v>

1777
01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.660
<v Speaker 12>One of the reasons is because they just </v>
<v Speaker 12>spent just,</v>

1778
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:23.533
<v Speaker 12>they're just going to be here for five </v>
<v Speaker 12>years and the oldest is just that </v>

1779
01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:29.480
<v Speaker 12>reviews are because.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And that's what she said,</v>

1780
01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:30.950
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's like,</v>

1781
01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:31.520
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>yeah,</v>

1782
01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.300
<v Speaker 12>that's actually no need for us to do </v>
<v Speaker 12>because you can also speak English.</v>

1783
01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.020
<v Speaker 12>But it's actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Most people actually in the,</v>

1784
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:42.280
<v Speaker 12>in the area to speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's actually no,</v>

1785
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:44.450
<v Speaker 12>the reverse thing of the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 12>know.</v>

1786
01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:47.390
<v Speaker 12>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>of course not all the Americans.</v>

1787
01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:48.283
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I have many friends who were Americans </v>

1788
01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:50.003
<v Speaker 12>this but as a found out and my </v>
<v Speaker 12>surroundings and stuff quite sensitive </v>

1789
01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:55.334
<v Speaker 12>because now this whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 12>interesting and after learning more </v>

1790
01:27:00.711 --> 01:27:01.544
<v Speaker 12>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I really found out that there's really </v>

1791
01:27:03.471 --> 01:27:04.304
<v Speaker 12>something,</v>
<v Speaker 12>some with some Americans here and not </v>

1792
01:27:07.521 --> 01:27:12.521
<v Speaker 12>willingness to assimilating based and </v>
<v Speaker 12>after asking know,</v>

1793
01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:13.620
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1794
01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.130
<v Speaker 12>after coding and um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>my uh,</v>

1795
01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:20.350
<v Speaker 12>ex employee who happens to work with the</v>
<v Speaker 12>office of statistics inside like,</v>

1796
01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.340
<v Speaker 12>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 12>because you know,</v>

1797
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.960
<v Speaker 12>now something like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm not all of them,</v>

1798
01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:28.130
<v Speaker 12>but some of them have something like a </v>
<v Speaker 12>special snowflake syndrome,</v>

1799
01:27:28.131 --> 01:27:29.540
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>something like that.</v>

1800
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we do it all.</v>

1801
01:27:30.891 --> 01:27:32.270
<v Speaker 12>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you can speak English,</v>

1802
01:27:32.271 --> 01:27:33.320
<v Speaker 12>so why should I know.</v>

1803
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1804
01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:36.700
<v Speaker 1>that's really fascinating because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>also shows that this,</v>

1805
01:27:36.730 --> 01:27:39.860
<v Speaker 1>all this integration stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration stuff and migrants stuff,</v>

1806
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.843
<v Speaker 1>it's not just about religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's culture because now you're telling </v>

1807
01:27:43.101 --> 01:27:43.934
<v Speaker 1>me that Americans are coming there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not because of religion that </v>

1808
01:27:45.921 --> 01:27:46.754
<v Speaker 1>they're not integrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's partly language only going to </v>

1809
01:27:48.761 --> 01:27:49.594
<v Speaker 1>be there for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There used to always speaking English </v>

1810
01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.553
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could go on way longer and I didn't </v>

1811
01:27:53.661 --> 01:27:54.494
<v Speaker 1>get to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get to half the stuff I wanted </v>

1812
01:27:55.971 --> 01:27:56.804
<v Speaker 1>to talk to you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we got to go so I thank you very </v>

1813
01:27:58.341 --> 01:27:59.300
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1814
01:27:59.301 --> 01:28:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm on with Stefanos from Greece to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fido's.</v>

1815
01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:03.063
<v Speaker 1>How's it going?</v>

1816
01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:08.920
<v Speaker 13>It was long.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Like I said previously,</v>

1817
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:09.763
<v Speaker 13>as long as they have it still money in </v>
<v Speaker 13>the bank just by the capital controls </v>

1818
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:18.590
<v Speaker 13>being implemented.</v>

1819
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can still live.</v>

1820
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:22.183
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that seems like a sort of depressing </v>

1821
01:28:24.321 --> 01:28:25.154
<v Speaker 1>but good place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't hear much about Greece in </v>

1822
01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:30.710
<v Speaker 1>the American media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you guys are going through a massive</v>

1823
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:33.560
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know,</v>

1824
01:28:33.561 --> 01:28:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I know you're not an expert in </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>

1825
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.673
<v Speaker 1>but can you sort of lay it out just what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average person in Greece is going </v>

1826
01:28:38.811 --> 01:28:39.644
<v Speaker 1>through right now?</v>

1827
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:45.470
<v Speaker 13>So let's just say that the minimum wage </v>
<v Speaker 13>here is a 500 euros.</v>

1828
01:28:48.210 --> 01:28:49.043
<v Speaker 13>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And show me one one coast cold that can </v>

1829
01:28:52.831 --> 01:28:54.710
<v Speaker 13>live like that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Just so.</v>

1830
01:28:54.850 --> 01:28:57.840
<v Speaker 13>So to me it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You can't do that.</v>

1831
01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.360
<v Speaker 13>And I'm again,</v>
<v Speaker 13>say fine,</v>

1832
01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:08.540
<v Speaker 13>it's 500 euros but can't go until he </v>
<v Speaker 13>stops me slightly less,</v>

1833
01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:14.810
<v Speaker 13>but no thinks memo dot dms that we other</v>
<v Speaker 13>being imposed by miracle and the rest of</v>

1834
01:29:17.071 --> 01:29:17.904
<v Speaker 13>the EU officials and we have to pay like</v>
<v Speaker 13>we have pretty much the taxation of </v>

1835
01:29:24.541 --> 01:29:28.650
<v Speaker 13>Germany and the wages and benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 13>Uganda.</v>

1836
01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically you guys,</v>

1837
01:29:30.381 --> 01:29:34.190
<v Speaker 1>because of the conditions that the EU </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped grease out with,</v>

1838
01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:35.173
<v Speaker 1>your taxes are very high and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that are getting a lot </v>

1839
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:40.460
<v Speaker 1>from the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's not a lot to go around.</v>

1840
01:29:40.461 --> 01:29:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Is that pretty much fair to say?</v>

1841
01:29:42.650 --> 01:29:43.483
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And so it's only the useful to the </v>

1842
01:29:46.011 --> 01:29:47.250
<v Speaker 13>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 13>eh,</v>

1843
01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:51.590
<v Speaker 13>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the ones responsible for this.</v>

1844
01:29:51.610 --> 01:29:53.660
<v Speaker 13>It might be no,</v>
<v Speaker 13>use my government,</v>

1845
01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:55.053
<v Speaker 13>this,</v>
<v Speaker 13>Theresa and the government that we have </v>

1846
01:29:57.381 --> 01:30:00.260
<v Speaker 13>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And they're the ones before them.</v>

1847
01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:02.910
<v Speaker 13>New Democracy for example,</v>
<v Speaker 13>if I saw,</v>

1848
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.870
<v Speaker 13>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So they're responsible for this.</v>

1849
01:30:06.210 --> 01:30:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you feel,</v>

1850
01:30:07.681 --> 01:30:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>

1851
01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.770
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy came from Greece.</v>

1852
01:30:10.771 --> 01:30:11.604
<v Speaker 1>Modern philosophy came from Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece has given so much in terms of </v>

1853
01:30:16.381 --> 01:30:17.214
<v Speaker 1>freedom and free thought to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about what's happening </v>

1854
01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.020
<v Speaker 1>in Greece at the moment?</v>

1855
01:30:22.630 --> 01:30:25.060
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 13>If only that existed here and it goes,</v>

1856
01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.830
<v Speaker 13>it's a big my 16 extinct species by now </v>
<v Speaker 13>here.</v>

1857
01:30:30.730 --> 01:30:34.080
<v Speaker 13>And the problem here is that,</v>
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

1858
01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.260
<v Speaker 13>let's see the elections,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the elections,</v>

1859
01:30:38.261 --> 01:30:40.820
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>being killed by a gold,</v>

1860
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:46.110
<v Speaker 13>gold singular logic that works with the </v>
<v Speaker 13>government to count all the votes,</v>

1861
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:47.783
<v Speaker 13>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So at the surface it's all fine and </v>

1862
01:30:52.061 --> 01:30:55.820
<v Speaker 13>dandy until you get to realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

1863
01:30:55.870 --> 01:31:00.000
<v Speaker 13>this company,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it belongs to the old sites.</v>

1864
01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:01.631
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the ones,</v>

1865
01:31:01.631 --> 01:31:04.540
<v Speaker 13>the big bad bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 13>which be honest,</v>

1866
01:31:04.541 --> 01:31:05.374
<v Speaker 13>a Canada and there are,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I think behind the scenes of all this </v>

1867
01:31:10.150 --> 01:31:10.983
<v Speaker 13>nonsense.</v>

1868
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:12.163
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So You guys are sort of caught between </v>

1869
01:31:13.131 --> 01:31:16.610
<v Speaker 1>the european union and the bankers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are kind of funding the election,</v>

1870
01:31:16.611 --> 01:31:17.410
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1871
01:31:17.410 --> 01:31:19.420
<v Speaker 13>They're the oneS benefiting from this </v>
<v Speaker 13>crisis.</v>

1872
01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1873
01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.040
<v Speaker 1>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get away.</v>

1874
01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:21.933
<v Speaker 1>Let's get away from politics for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute because it obviously can be a </v>

1875
01:31:24.490 --> 01:31:25.730
<v Speaker 1>pretty sobering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1876
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:28.140
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you wanted to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me about was gamergate,</v>

1877
01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:30.970
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people jumped on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gamer gate idea.</v>

1878
01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Anything specific on gamer gate or how </v>
<v Speaker 1>did you get involved in it?</v>

1879
01:31:34.631 --> 01:31:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Were you in it from the beginning</v>

1880
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.843
<v Speaker 13>and once you've moved in?</v>
<v Speaker 13>The moment I heard about this story of </v>

1881
01:31:42.670 --> 01:31:46.570
<v Speaker 13>having sex with one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the eh,</v>

1882
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:51.300
<v Speaker 13>the journalist in goto when he posted </v>
<v Speaker 13>there,</v>

1883
01:31:51.301 --> 01:31:56.301
<v Speaker 13>If you have a quest,</v>
<v Speaker 13>if I'm right that game.</v>

1884
01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:01.860
<v Speaker 13>So it is obvious that the,</v>
<v Speaker 13>oh,</v>

1885
01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:06.880
<v Speaker 13>this gaming journalism websites I got up</v>
<v Speaker 13>and they all have these feminists.</v>

1886
01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:15.200
<v Speaker 13>Dsa was in all these people defend this.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Like why defend this?</v>

1887
01:32:17.130 --> 01:32:17.963
<v Speaker 13>The,</v>
<v Speaker 13>they don't care about gamers don't get </v>

1888
01:32:19.691 --> 01:32:20.450
<v Speaker 13>up us.</v>

1889
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:21.283
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I was so interested in gamer </v>

1890
01:32:22.821 --> 01:32:24.280
<v Speaker 1>gate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even before I,</v>

1891
01:32:24.281 --> 01:32:25.114
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be a gamer like in the </v>

1892
01:32:27.290 --> 01:32:28.123
<v Speaker 1>eighties and nineties and now like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>love the culture around video games but </v>

1893
01:32:30.681 --> 01:32:31.514
<v Speaker 1>I don't play that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought the whole thing was </v>

1894
01:32:33.081 --> 01:32:33.914
<v Speaker 1>fascinating because you guys were </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with so much of the stuff that </v>

1895
01:32:36.711 --> 01:32:38.090
<v Speaker 1>we talk about now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gamers,</v>

1896
01:32:38.091 --> 01:32:40.640
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with all the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice warrior stuff,</v>

1897
01:32:40.670 --> 01:32:43.100
<v Speaker 1>all the collusion between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1898
01:32:43.101 --> 01:32:48.101
<v Speaker 1>creators and the publishers and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and feminism and,</v>

1899
01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:49.023
<v Speaker 1>and all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of seeped up into society </v>

1900
01:32:51.951 --> 01:32:52.784
<v Speaker 1>which is a good transition for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also wanted to talk about cultural </v>

1901
01:32:55.611 --> 01:32:58.220
<v Speaker 1>marxism and I think that's very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>related.</v>

1902
01:32:58.221 --> 01:32:59.054
<v Speaker 1>So how has cultural marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas of it taking root in Greece </v>

1903
01:33:02.271 --> 01:33:03.104
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

1904
01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:05.573
<v Speaker 13>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Say that pretty much invented eh </v>

1905
01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:11.293
<v Speaker 13>cultural marxism really throuGh the fact</v>
<v Speaker 13>that we have like series a and next </v>

1906
01:33:17.591 --> 01:33:20.080
<v Speaker 13>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 13>those are the parties under a.</v>

1907
01:33:20.081 --> 01:33:23.390
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 13>which is not doing parliament right now.</v>

1908
01:33:23.391 --> 01:33:28.391
<v Speaker 13>They get like one percent of the vote or</v>
<v Speaker 13>soMething and the radicals and there was</v>

1909
01:33:29.601 --> 01:33:34.601
<v Speaker 13>also also known as the socialist which </v>
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

1910
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:40.250
<v Speaker 13>was responsible for the grants that we </v>
<v Speaker 13>live right now.</v>

1911
01:33:40.251 --> 01:33:44.840
<v Speaker 13>Like they were promising to people </v>
<v Speaker 13>things that on the surface are needed,</v>

1912
01:33:44.841 --> 01:33:45.674
<v Speaker 13>like high wages,</v>
<v Speaker 13>a pensions benefits and all that good </v>

1913
01:33:49.401 --> 01:33:52.100
<v Speaker 13>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But what they do,</v>

1914
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:53.443
<v Speaker 13>well they did,</v>
<v Speaker 13>let's say during the eighties they </v>

1915
01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:00.710
<v Speaker 13>tripled that way.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So that's fine.</v>

1916
01:34:00.711 --> 01:34:05.711
<v Speaker 13>But they did well not acknowledging that</v>
<v Speaker 13>you to do that,</v>

1917
01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:10.130
<v Speaker 13>you have to take some counter measures </v>
<v Speaker 13>as well,</v>

1918
01:34:10.131 --> 01:34:10.964
<v Speaker 13>like you have to decrease a taxation for</v>
<v Speaker 13>the company so that they can pay their </v>

1919
01:34:15.681 --> 01:34:18.110
<v Speaker 13>employees and they didn't do that.</v>

1920
01:34:18.170 --> 01:34:21.800
<v Speaker 13>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 13>a lot of interest industries that we had</v>

1921
01:34:21.801 --> 01:34:22.634
<v Speaker 13>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 13>like,</v>

1922
01:34:23.130 --> 01:34:25.000
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

1923
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:28.460
<v Speaker 13>we used to have great bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 13>for example,</v>

1924
01:34:28.461 --> 01:34:33.461
<v Speaker 13>we had that car industry small but still</v>
<v Speaker 13>relevant at the time.</v>

1925
01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.113
<v Speaker 13>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 13>they all closed down in the situation </v>

1926
01:34:38.241 --> 01:34:41.600
<v Speaker 13>was Getting worse and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And now that wayne,</v>

1927
01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:42.493
<v Speaker 13>we eh carbon to be in the eu and despite</v>
<v Speaker 13>the things that were being told by the </v>

1928
01:34:48.291 --> 01:34:49.124
<v Speaker 13>media that oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the u is our home and if we live will </v>

1929
01:34:52.011 --> 01:34:54.870
<v Speaker 13>turn into North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's fuckinG laughable.</v>

1930
01:34:54.871 --> 01:34:57.560
<v Speaker 13>And how am I supposed to take you </v>
<v Speaker 13>seriously after this?</v>

1931
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:02.640
<v Speaker 13>So basically the problems that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 13>a pretty much,</v>

1932
01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.010
<v Speaker 13>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>eh,</v>

1933
01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:05.563
<v Speaker 13>have gone plus 10 right at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We joined the eu and the eurozone in </v>

1934
01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 13>2001.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I think.</v>

1935
01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:14.850
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1936
01:35:14.851 --> 01:35:16.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was about a year ago when the</v>

1937
01:35:16.570 --> 01:35:17.403
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis seemed to be at its </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst right before the eu came in and </v>

1938
01:35:20.261 --> 01:35:21.094
<v Speaker 1>bailed out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're saying this is a pretty </v>

1939
01:35:22.421 --> 01:35:24.550
<v Speaker 1>crappy situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what was it like,</v>

1940
01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:27.610
<v Speaker 1>like when you couldn't go to the atm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get money out,</v>

1941
01:35:27.611 --> 01:35:31.240
<v Speaker 1>didn't they stop money coming up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what did that feel like for you and</v>

1942
01:35:31.241 --> 01:35:34.720
<v Speaker 1>for your family when it feels like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is collapsing?</v>

1943
01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:37.613
<v Speaker 13>It's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 13>They found the fact that you have to </v>

1944
01:35:39.821 --> 01:35:44.821
<v Speaker 13>take only 60 euros per day.</v>
<v Speaker 13>The atm and yeah,</v>

1945
01:35:47.170 --> 01:35:49.830
<v Speaker 13>we kind of have to adjust that.</v>

1946
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:51.361
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1947
01:35:51.361 --> 01:35:52.980
<v Speaker 1>we could talk about so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went,</v>

1948
01:35:53.010 --> 01:35:54.420
<v Speaker 1>we went pretty heavy here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1949
01:35:54.421 --> 01:35:56.730
<v Speaker 1>where's the best place for Slovakia in </v>
<v Speaker 1>athens?</v>

1950
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:58.583
<v Speaker 13>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>there are several restaurants we didn't </v>

<v Speaker 13>know that,</v>

1952
01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:03.573

1953
01:36:06.841 --> 01:36:09.580
<v Speaker 13>you.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But one warning,</v>

1954
01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:14.770
<v Speaker 13>if you see that kind of like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 13>olive oil avoided,</v>

1955
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:17.420
<v Speaker 1>stay away from the gyros with a lot of </v>

<v Speaker 13>least to me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of the 20 people that I actually do know</v>
<v Speaker 1>of because I follow you on twitter and </v>

<v Speaker 1>great videos talking about atheism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>secularism and being an ex muslim and </v>

1973
01:36:57.021 --> 01:36:59.810
<v Speaker 1>the regressive left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this stuff.</v>

1974
01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into that,</v>

1975
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:05.420
<v Speaker 1>tell me your 31 in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is life in Egypt these days?</v>

1976
01:37:06.730 --> 01:37:08.800
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's kind of okay.</v>

1977
01:37:08.801 --> 01:37:12.490
<v Speaker 14>I mean by look out when I,</v>
<v Speaker 14>when people ask me that question,</v>

1978
01:37:12.491 --> 01:37:13.324
<v Speaker 14>I always like to think you'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 14>give myself some hope to say at least </v>

1979
01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:18.460
<v Speaker 14>I'm not living in Afghanistan or Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 14>Arabia.</v>

1980
01:37:19.290 --> 01:37:21.790
<v Speaker 14>So you're not just,</v>
<v Speaker 14>yeah,</v>

1981
01:37:21.791 --> 01:37:23.260
<v Speaker 14>just be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1982
01:37:23.290 --> 01:37:27.160
<v Speaker 14>to function and actually like on a day </v>
<v Speaker 14>to day basis,</v>

1983
01:37:27.161 --> 01:37:30.830
<v Speaker 14>I really don't feel like that much of </v>
<v Speaker 14>it,</v>

1984
01:37:30.850 --> 01:37:34.870
<v Speaker 14>just like for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 14>other people are getting like bad,</v>

1985
01:37:34.871 --> 01:37:37.990
<v Speaker 14>but for me I maybe because I just have </v>
<v Speaker 14>thick skin or something,</v>

1986
01:37:37.991 --> 01:37:40.330
<v Speaker 14>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I'm not really feeling that affected.</v>

1987
01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:41.740
<v Speaker 14>So yeaH.</v>

1988
01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.433
<v Speaker 1>So we don't have to go too much into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics because I want to really focus </v>

1989
01:37:46.021 --> 01:37:47.370
<v Speaker 1>on what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1990
01:37:47.371 --> 01:37:48.181
<v Speaker 1>he was only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1991
01:37:48.181 --> 01:37:49.014
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years ago that the arab spring </v>

1992
01:37:51.421 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 1>happened and you guys lived under </v>
<v Speaker 1>mubarak who was basically a dictator for</v>

1993
01:37:56.101 --> 01:37:56.934
<v Speaker 1>30 something years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You then you had the muslim brotherhood </v>

1994
01:37:59.281 --> 01:38:01.620
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by democratic elections for a year.</v>

1995
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Then they get overthrown by the military</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1996
01:38:04.711 --> 01:38:06.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's where you're at now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1997
01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two people there.</v>

1998
01:38:08.431 --> 01:38:09.264
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they feel just about the whole </v>

1999
01:38:10.771 --> 01:38:11.604
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a feeling that democracy is </v>

2000
01:38:13.051 --> 01:38:13.884
<v Speaker 1>ever going to come back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they want democracy to come back </v>

2001
01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.490
<v Speaker 1>because it didn't really work for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

2002
01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the feelinG there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2003
01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:19.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2004
01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:23.360
<v Speaker 14>to like differentiate between like two,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like glasses with people.</v>

2005
01:38:23.361 --> 01:38:25.880
<v Speaker 14>So we have like that majority of </v>
<v Speaker 14>egyptians,</v>

2006
01:38:25.881 --> 01:38:29.050
<v Speaker 14>like their normal everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like dental people do.</v>

2007
01:38:29.150 --> 01:38:31.360
<v Speaker 14>I would say they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I don't,</v>

2008
01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:34.520
<v Speaker 14>I'm not happy right now as,</v>
<v Speaker 14>as they should,</v>

2009
01:38:34.570 --> 01:38:35.403
<v Speaker 14>but they're like kind of okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Like what would look with the current </v>

2010
01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:39.673
<v Speaker 14>government,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they were not happy during the muslim </v>

2011
01:38:41.361 --> 01:38:42.194
<v Speaker 14>brotherhood even more,</v>
<v Speaker 14>even less happy than deal with under </v>

2012
01:38:43.911 --> 01:38:44.930
<v Speaker 14>mubarak.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So that,</v>

2013
01:38:44.931 --> 01:38:45.764
<v Speaker 14>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 14>that was gonna work at all that the </v>

2014
01:38:48.231 --> 01:38:52.460
<v Speaker 14>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So bonked the political class in Egypt,</v>

2015
01:38:52.461 --> 01:38:55.190
<v Speaker 14>which I happen to just saying that like </v>
<v Speaker 14>90 percent of them are idiots,</v>

2016
01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.230
<v Speaker 14>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>yeah,</v>

2017
01:38:57.231 --> 01:39:00.530
<v Speaker 14>they're not happy with anything which I </v>
<v Speaker 14>think is,</v>

2018
01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:01.633
<v Speaker 14>do you have like this like kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 14>aggressive his jaw kind of a thing </v>

2019
01:39:05.481 --> 01:39:09.020
<v Speaker 14>happening like all the time and they're </v>
<v Speaker 14>not focusing on what's important.</v>

2020
01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.300
<v Speaker 14>So they're just make big deals about </v>
<v Speaker 14>nothing.</v>

2021
01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:12.613
<v Speaker 14>While it will not talking about people </v>
<v Speaker 14>going to jail for just saying like </v>

2022
01:39:16.791 --> 01:39:19.610
<v Speaker 14>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like just stupid shit.</v>

2023
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.823
<v Speaker 14>The sick people are going to jail for </v>
<v Speaker 14>making jokes about feeling like balloon </v>

2024
01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:29.840
<v Speaker 14>balloon condoms with air and handed them</v>
<v Speaker 14>out so they just send them to prison.</v>

2025
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:32.070
<v Speaker 14>Some people just went to prison because </v>
<v Speaker 14>of the glue,</v>

2026
01:39:32.071 --> 01:39:34.010
<v Speaker 14>like sketch comedy on youtube or </v>
<v Speaker 14>something.</v>

2027
01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:34.873
<v Speaker 14>They sent them to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So I think the most important thing </v>

2028
01:39:36.981 --> 01:39:38.330
<v Speaker 14>that,</v>
<v Speaker 14>that needs to change in Egypt,</v>

2029
01:39:38.331 --> 01:39:41.720
<v Speaker 14>not another gene,</v>
<v Speaker 14>not the economy economy,</v>

2030
01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.690
<v Speaker 14>and they're just doing what they can.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I mean the government,</v>

2031
01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:45.680
<v Speaker 14>they,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they,</v>

2032
01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.370
<v Speaker 14>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

2033
01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:50.150
<v Speaker 14>they have an interest to just do as bit </v>
<v Speaker 14>as best as they can.</v>

2034
01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:54.680
<v Speaker 14>What I really think is important is the </v>
<v Speaker 14>whole free speech and like the blasphemy</v>

2035
01:39:54.681 --> 01:39:55.514
<v Speaker 14>law,</v>
<v Speaker 14>the,</v>

2036
01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.433
<v Speaker 14>that</v>

2037
01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.273
<v Speaker 1>modesty laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of loads need to go because </v>

2038
01:39:59.651 --> 01:40:01.510
<v Speaker 1>the constitution actually doesn't allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2039
01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Some people should just focus on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2040
01:40:05.170 --> 01:40:06.003
<v Speaker 1>raising the money getting goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like laws in front of the parliament or </v>

2041
01:40:08.561 --> 01:40:10.030
<v Speaker 1>in front of even the constitutional </v>
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>

2042
01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Because the egyptian constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read it and forget it from Egypt,</v>

2043
01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.093
<v Speaker 1>you really want to know that it's for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like 99 point nine percent </v>

2044
01:40:18.371 --> 01:40:19.204
<v Speaker 1>secular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really freedom of speech like has </v>

2045
01:40:21.251 --> 01:40:23.650
<v Speaker 1>its own article that's like totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed,</v>

2046
01:40:23.651 --> 01:40:26.470
<v Speaker 1>no restrictions moment in invitations </v>
<v Speaker 1>under any circumstances.</v>

2047
01:40:26.590 --> 01:40:27.423
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that we have laws punishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because the insulted this guy or </v>

2048
01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:35.380
<v Speaker 1>the president or like some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anyone,</v>

2049
01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:38.620
<v Speaker 1>it's unconstitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 100 percent unconstitutional.</v>

2050
01:40:38.621 --> 01:40:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with all that in mind,</v>

2051
01:40:40.151 --> 01:40:40.984
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you get the balls to do what </v>

2052
01:40:43.181 --> 01:40:45.100
<v Speaker 1>you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're showing me your face right now.</v>

2053
01:40:45.101 --> 01:40:45.934
<v Speaker 1>I asked you before we started recording </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was okay if we wanted to do </v>

2054
01:40:48.371 --> 01:40:50.890
<v Speaker 1>something different or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear a mask or whatever,</v>

2055
01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.840
<v Speaker 1>but I mean you'd put your videos out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there with your.</v>

2056
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.123
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're incredibly brave and clear and </v>

2057
01:40:55.991 --> 01:40:56.824
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2058
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:59.120
<v Speaker 14>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Just I don't see.</v>

2059
01:40:59.910 --> 01:41:01.070
<v Speaker 14>Oh okay.</v>
<v Speaker 14>that's better.</v>

2060
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:02.770
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I don't see it like that.</v>

2061
01:41:02.771 --> 01:41:03.604
<v Speaker 14>I just see it.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Like I said that before to a lot of </v>

2062
01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:10.980
<v Speaker 14>people are not doing the videos </v>
<v Speaker 14>anonymously to hide it.</v>

2063
01:41:10.981 --> 01:41:12.430
<v Speaker 14>Just like my,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

2064
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:16.780
<v Speaker 14>my privacy kind of that I don't like </v>
<v Speaker 14>putting my face on camera all the time.</v>

2065
01:41:16.890 --> 01:41:19.120
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 14>But I mean if I was living in America or</v>

2066
01:41:19.121 --> 01:41:21.220
<v Speaker 14>something,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I would still do the videos anonymously.</v>

2067
01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:25.240
<v Speaker 14>People seem to miss that point.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I said that all that I'm not hiding.</v>

2068
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:27.150
<v Speaker 14>I just don't like putting my face on </v>
<v Speaker 14>camera.</v>

2069
01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:29.920
<v Speaker 14>I just don't like seeing myself on </v>
<v Speaker 14>camera.</v>

2070
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:31.410
<v Speaker 14>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I'm not.</v>

2071
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:35.140
<v Speaker 14>And to me it's like I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's like I'm tired.</v>

2072
01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.180
<v Speaker 14>I'm like city one,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but I feel like I'm 60.</v>

2073
01:41:37.181 --> 01:41:39.940
<v Speaker 14>I'm thought I'm not going to hide it.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I'm not going to censor myself anymore.</v>

2074
01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:40.773
<v Speaker 14>It's just like people seem to forget </v>
<v Speaker 14>that on a day to day basis I have to </v>

2075
01:41:44.351 --> 01:41:48.400
<v Speaker 14>pretend to be someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like everyone around me.</v>

2076
01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:50.643
<v Speaker 14>Even when I'm getting ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 14>god I have to like agree with the guy </v>

2077
01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:53.933
<v Speaker 14>was cutting my hair that dealt with or </v>
<v Speaker 14>we have like a particularly hot summer </v>

2078
01:41:57.420 --> 01:42:00.500
<v Speaker 14>these days that the weather is like a </v>
<v Speaker 14>last thing and,</v>

2079
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:01.343
<v Speaker 14>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>we have to be thankful because some </v>

2080
01:42:02.561 --> 01:42:05.140
<v Speaker 14>people got it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So I have to agree with that.</v>

2081
01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:07.750
<v Speaker 14>Like every single minute of every single</v>
<v Speaker 14>day.</v>

2082
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:09.520
<v Speaker 14>So I'm not going to censor myself </v>
<v Speaker 14>online.</v>

2083
01:42:09.521 --> 01:42:10.180
<v Speaker 14>That's like,</v>

2084
01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:11.630
<v Speaker 1>was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to,</v>

2085
01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:12.493
<v Speaker 1>you have to thank all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hot but not hot or that </v>

2086
01:42:14.811 --> 01:42:15.644
<v Speaker 1>really hot.</v>

2087
01:42:16.090 --> 01:42:16.541
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

2088
01:42:16.541 --> 01:42:17.374
<v Speaker 14>So basically in every muslim country is </v>
<v Speaker 14>you have to be thankful because you're </v>

2089
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:22.833
<v Speaker 14>not like the worst thing on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So as long as there's one guy that's </v>

2090
01:42:27.401 --> 01:42:29.500
<v Speaker 14>worse than you,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you have to be thankful.</v>

2091
01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:31.990
<v Speaker 14>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>that guy.</v>

2092
01:42:31.991 --> 01:42:34.480
<v Speaker 14>And that guy should like,</v>
<v Speaker 14>have a problem with god.</v>

2093
01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:35.280
<v Speaker 14>Seriously.</v>

2094
01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.200
<v Speaker 1>It can always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can always get worse.</v>

2095
01:42:37.201 --> 01:42:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

2096
01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:40.110
<v Speaker 1>So I want to talk a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your personal stuff.</v>

2097
01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.500
<v Speaker 1>So you are an atheist and you consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself an ex muslim,</v>

2098
01:42:43.501 --> 01:42:45.000
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2099
01:42:45.110 --> 01:42:47.790
<v Speaker 1>So you put these videos out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

2100
01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:49.530
<v Speaker 1>you have a real fan base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

2101
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about in your own personal life?</v>

2102
01:42:51.661 --> 01:42:52.920
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

2103
01:42:52.921 --> 01:42:53.754
<v Speaker 1>are you out to your friends and family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how much can you talk about that </v>

2104
01:42:56.971 --> 01:42:57.804
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>

2105
01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:58.990
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 14>look,</v>

2106
01:42:58.991 --> 01:43:03.370
<v Speaker 14>my friends and family,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like they know I'm not like religious.</v>

2107
01:43:03.490 --> 01:43:06.880
<v Speaker 14>That's what they know.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And they know that I'm kind of like,</v>

2108
01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:08.613
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I,</v>

2109
01:43:08.630 --> 01:43:11.920
<v Speaker 14>I just don't care about any annual that </v>
<v Speaker 14>they know that,</v>

2110
01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:16.010
<v Speaker 14>but they don't know that I'm like a </v>
<v Speaker 14>hundred percent atheist.</v>

2111
01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:16.923
<v Speaker 14>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 14>the idea wouldn't even enter their </v>

2112
01:43:18.131 --> 01:43:21.130
<v Speaker 14>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Even if I told them they would be like,</v>

2113
01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:23.390
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>there's not,</v>

2114
01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:26.710
<v Speaker 14>the mind wouldn't be like cut because </v>
<v Speaker 14>the option's not on the table.</v>

2115
01:43:26.711 --> 01:43:28.660
<v Speaker 14>He didn't like Egypt during the muslim </v>
<v Speaker 14>countries.</v>

2116
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:31.990
<v Speaker 14>It's not an option to be an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 14>No one knew that.</v>

2117
01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:32.853
<v Speaker 14>No one told me that.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So if someone would have told me that </v>

2118
01:43:35.021 --> 01:43:39.250
<v Speaker 14>when I was six years old because I </v>
<v Speaker 14>always wasn't compliant with religion.</v>

2119
01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:42.280
<v Speaker 14>So if someone would've told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like when I was young,</v>

2120
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:43.423
<v Speaker 14>the idea I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I might've made the switch a long time </v>

2121
01:43:46.361 --> 01:43:48.370
<v Speaker 14>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but the idea wasn't even there.</v>

2122
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:50.530
<v Speaker 14>So when did you make that switch?</v>
<v Speaker 14>When did you wake up?</v>

2123
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:52.103
<v Speaker 14>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I think it was about three years ago at </v>

2124
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:55.100
<v Speaker 14>some,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like a,</v>

2125
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:56.183
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like I had like a major event happened </v>

2126
01:43:59.031 --> 01:44:01.970
<v Speaker 14>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So I had to stop because I was just gone</v>

2127
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:03.163
<v Speaker 14>and I wasn't really paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 14>but I never really was a muslim if you </v>

2128
01:44:06.481 --> 01:44:07.314
<v Speaker 14>really like</v>

2129
01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.180
<v Speaker 14>considered it a like what,</v>
<v Speaker 14>what,</v>

2130
01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:12.460
<v Speaker 14>how I was living.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I never really was.</v>

2131
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:15.040
<v Speaker 14>I didn't even stop to think,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know what,</v>

2132
01:44:15.041 --> 01:44:17.800
<v Speaker 14>maybe this is all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I never stopped to say that to myself,</v>

2133
01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.790
<v Speaker 14>but when my life just stopped me,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like forcefully stop.</v>

2134
01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.393
<v Speaker 14>I hAd,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I had some time to like reflect and </v>

2135
01:44:25.181 --> 01:44:28.300
<v Speaker 14>think and just reach a conclusion that </v>
<v Speaker 14>it was just like right there.</v>

2136
01:44:28.301 --> 01:44:30.010
<v Speaker 14>But they never really even considered </v>
<v Speaker 14>it.</v>

2137
01:44:30.250 --> 01:44:31.083
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And did you jump on youtube right after </v>

2138
01:44:32.381 --> 01:44:33.214
<v Speaker 14>that?</v>
<v Speaker 14>Because the stuff that you do there is </v>

2139
01:44:33.971 --> 01:44:34.804
<v Speaker 14>really great.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And we'll put a link below so everyone </v>

2140
01:44:36.191 --> 01:44:38.260
<v Speaker 14>can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 14>This is it though,</v>

2141
01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:39.900
<v Speaker 14>isn't great.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I don't think it.</v>

2142
01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:42.770
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 14>But I,</v>

2143
01:44:42.771 --> 01:44:44.920
<v Speaker 14>I think you're brave for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Actually.</v>

2144
01:44:45.130 --> 01:44:47.040
<v Speaker 14>I'm brave.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I think you're backwards.</v>

2145
01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:48.160
<v Speaker 14>No,</v>
<v Speaker 14>no,</v>

2146
01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:48.993
<v Speaker 14>no.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Because like my videos are not like </v>

2147
01:44:50.410 --> 01:44:55.110
<v Speaker 14>advertiser friendly or something.</v>
<v Speaker 14>They don't really follow like cold,</v>

<v Speaker 14>like.</v>

2149
01:44:55.710 --> 01:44:56.950

<v Speaker 14>I know.</v>

2151
01:44:58.210 --> 01:45:03.210
<v Speaker 14>What actually made me jump from unt was,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I know it's like a cliche at this point,</v>

2152
01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:06.070
<v Speaker 14>but actually it was the sam harris ben </v>
<v Speaker 14>affleck.</v>

2153
01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.310
<v Speaker 14>Think,</v>

<v Speaker 14>no.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Someone needs like,</v>

2160
01:45:15.610 --> 01:45:18.250
<v Speaker 14>someone needs to have this guy's back </v>

01:45:48.291 --> 01:45:50.240
<v Speaker 14>other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I was like,</v>

2172
01:45:50.241 --> 01:45:52.700
<v Speaker 14>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 14>if I get like 100 years on that,</v>

<v Speaker 14>8,000</v>
<v Speaker 14>miles away from each other and that </v>

2177
01:46:03.471 --> 01:46:05.030
<v Speaker 14>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 14>that same night,</v>

2178
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:07.630
<v Speaker 14>I mean that was my awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I had had a little,</v>

2179
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:11.400
<v Speaker 14>a little crack in my awakening before </v>
<v Speaker 14>that and,</v>

2180
01:46:11.490 --> 01:46:13.100
<v Speaker 14>and,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but we had that together that,</v>

<v Speaker 14>that is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So I'm thrilled to be talking to you.</v>

<v Speaker 14>go ahead.</v>

2185
01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:20.893
<v Speaker 14>You're a good host to a so we only have,</v>
<v Speaker 14>we only have like another minute but </v>

<v Speaker 14>I'll do something else with you in the </v>
<v Speaker 14>future.</v>

2187
01:46:26.091 --> 01:46:26.924
<v Speaker 14>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>just talk to me a little bit about the </v>

2188
01:46:28.281 --> 01:46:30.820
<v Speaker 14>regressives because you hate them as </v>
<v Speaker 14>much as I do this,</v>

2189
01:46:30.821 --> 01:46:32.030
<v Speaker 14>this regressive ideology.</v>

2190
01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:32.953
<v Speaker 14>So how does it affect you as a free </v>
<v Speaker 14>thinker and a secularist and an atheist </v>

2191
01:46:36.411 --> 01:46:39.230
<v Speaker 14>in Egypt?</v>
<v Speaker 14>How does their ideology harm you?</v>

2192
01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:41.810
<v Speaker 14>Your ability to live the way you want?</v>
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>

2193
01:46:41.811 --> 01:46:42.644
<v Speaker 14>the basically shutting down any </v>
<v Speaker 14>conversation that could bleed to </v>

2194
01:46:45.291 --> 01:46:48.190
<v Speaker 14>anything because when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 14>about like that.</v>

2195
01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:49.753
<v Speaker 14>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 14>that,</v>

2196
01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:50.580
<v Speaker 14>that,</v>
<v Speaker 14>that,</v>

2197
01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:51.413
<v Speaker 14>that there's no such thing that like,</v>
<v Speaker 14>that islam is just like any other </v>

2198
01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:58.660
<v Speaker 14>religion and like that they're ignoring </v>
<v Speaker 14>like the,</v>

2199
01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:03.260
<v Speaker 14>like the majority of muslims like </v>
<v Speaker 14>believe outside of us that day,</v>

2200
01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:04.193
<v Speaker 14>the United States or the uk or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 14>that we are like living in horrible </v>

2201
01:47:08.581 --> 01:47:10.050
<v Speaker 14>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Do look at me,</v>

2202
01:47:10.051 --> 01:47:12.450
<v Speaker 14>I'm living like fantastically compared </v>
<v Speaker 14>to other people.</v>

2203
01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:15.570
<v Speaker 14>Even in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 14>no one bothers me.</v>

2204
01:47:15.571 --> 01:47:18.150
<v Speaker 14>I do whatever I want but some people </v>
<v Speaker 14>can't.</v>

2205
01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:23.660
<v Speaker 14>And when when you start seeing things </v>
<v Speaker 14>like that's like racist to just say that</v>

2206
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.313
<v Speaker 14>we should like keep an eye on,</v>
<v Speaker 14>on some issues that are very important </v>

2207
01:47:29.431 --> 01:47:31.620
<v Speaker 14>and you should like,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you liberal.</v>

2208
01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:34.270
<v Speaker 14>That's the problem too.</v>
<v Speaker 14>You should,</v>

2209
01:47:34.770 --> 01:47:38.520
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you should actually leave everything and</v>

2210
01:47:38.521 --> 01:47:39.354
<v Speaker 14>just focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 14>There are people getting murdered to </v>

2211
01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:45.840
<v Speaker 14>being gay or saying the wrong thing or </v>
<v Speaker 14>for listening the wrong kind of music or</v>

2212
01:47:46.410 --> 01:47:47.243
<v Speaker 14>you should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 14>You should champion that cause not just </v>

2213
01:47:49.891 --> 01:47:53.350
<v Speaker 14>for people living outside of year that's</v>
<v Speaker 14>just living inside you this and,</v>

2214
01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.193
<v Speaker 14>and the work travel because you know the</v>
<v Speaker 14>internet and all of that and don't even </v>

2215
01:47:58.141 --> 01:48:02.220
<v Speaker 14>get me started on this nonsense about </v>
<v Speaker 14>like feminism and islam.</v>

2216
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.330
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 14>We need like a whole other app.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Here's what we do for real.</v>

2218
01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:07.953

<v Speaker 1>this is just the beginning and I truly </v>

<v Speaker 1>am a fan of yours,</v>

2220
01:48:12.641 --> 01:48:13.474
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sorry we had to cut it short and </v>

2221
01:48:15.431 --> 01:48:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you know what I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you this,</v>

2222
01:48:17.351 --> 01:48:21.370
<v Speaker 1>but I was in Egypt back in 1997.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like a lifetime ago.</v>

2223
01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2224
01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:25.400

<v Speaker 1>maybe we can work that to.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Air conditioning.</v>

2241
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:08.663

<v Speaker 1>Very nice.</v>

01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:12.260
<v Speaker 1>well I'm super excited to talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2244
01:49:12.261 --> 01:49:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a lot of responses.</v>

2245
01:49:14.061 --> 01:49:14.894
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that all one point 2 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion with a b people in India </v>

2246
01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:19.513
<v Speaker 1>responded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we did get a ton of responses from </v>

2247
01:49:21.621 --> 01:49:23.880
<v Speaker 1>India about 100 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2248
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:25.250
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're the,</v>

2249
01:49:25.251 --> 01:49:26.084
<v Speaker 1>you're the lucky one out of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a lot of things that you </v>

2250
01:49:28.491 --> 01:49:30.710
<v Speaker 1>sent me that I thought were really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>

2251
01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so first off,</v>

2252
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.740
<v Speaker 1>and a few people in India talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2253
01:49:34.010 --> 01:49:34.843
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned just the general state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of expression in India right </v>

2254
01:49:38.511 --> 01:49:39.344
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you tell me a little bit about </v>

2255
01:49:40.521 --> 01:49:43.340
<v Speaker 1>your concerns about the state of freedom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of expression?</v>

2256
01:49:44.690 --> 01:49:45.523
<v Speaker 15>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I don't want to paint a very dangerous </v>

2257
01:49:48.731 --> 01:49:51.220
<v Speaker 15>scenario or something on that sort,</v>
<v Speaker 15>but you know,</v>

2258
01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:53.620
<v Speaker 15>as a skeptic,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I'm a skeptic myself.</v>

2259
01:49:53.621 --> 01:49:54.920
<v Speaker 15>So,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I mean,</v>

2260
01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:55.773
<v Speaker 15>in India we had some weird laws.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So I'll give you an example of a couple </v>

2261
01:49:58.061 --> 01:50:00.270
<v Speaker 15>of situations.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So it all starts with a,</v>

2262
01:50:00.490 --> 01:50:03.580
<v Speaker 15>a particular constitutional article or </v>
<v Speaker 15>two 95 eight.</v>

2263
01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:08.080
<v Speaker 15>So basically that article restricts any </v>
<v Speaker 15>criticism of religion.</v>

2264
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:09.603
<v Speaker 15>So I'm not going to give the whole text </v>
<v Speaker 15>of the article to you because that will </v>

2265
01:50:12.291 --> 01:50:13.124
<v Speaker 15>just take away a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 15>But the article says that you cannot </v>

2266
01:50:16.271 --> 01:50:21.010
<v Speaker 15>hurt the sentiments of religious people </v>
<v Speaker 15>and here's the funny part.</v>

2267
01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:21.933
<v Speaker 15>So it's basically a blasphemy law anD </v>
<v Speaker 15>India is a 80 percent hindu country and </v>

2268
01:50:27.401 --> 01:50:30.300
<v Speaker 15>hinduism does not even have a concept of</v>
<v Speaker 15>blessed with me.</v>

2269
01:50:31.090 --> 01:50:31.923
<v Speaker 15>So I mean it's hilarious actually.</v>
<v Speaker 15>But the history of the law is that in </v>

2270
01:50:35.771 --> 01:50:38.470
<v Speaker 15>1926,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I think it was in 1926,</v>

2271
01:50:38.471 --> 01:50:39.304
<v Speaker 15>we had this,</v>
<v Speaker 15>a publisher who published a book called </v>

2272
01:50:41.351 --> 01:50:43.990
<v Speaker 15>the gila soon.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So it's award in hindi.</v>

2273
01:50:43.991 --> 01:50:48.991
<v Speaker 15>So dragila resume means a prophet </v>
<v Speaker 15>muhammad the casanova or the playboy.</v>

2274
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:50.103
<v Speaker 15>So it basically spoke about the </v>
<v Speaker 15>marriages and the sex life of prophet </v>

2275
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:54.703
<v Speaker 15>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Now obviously muslims did not like her </v>

2276
01:50:57.011 --> 01:50:59.590
<v Speaker 15>at that time and there was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 15>rioting.</v>

2277
01:50:59.650 --> 01:51:03.550
<v Speaker 15>This is in 1986.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So eventually the publisher was murdered</v>

2278
01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.073
<v Speaker 15>and the villagers,</v>
<v Speaker 15>because they didn't want to deal with </v>

2279
01:51:06.191 --> 01:51:07.024
<v Speaker 15>it,</v>
<v Speaker 15>they just came up with is blasphemy law </v>

2280
01:51:08.410 --> 01:51:12.450
<v Speaker 15>and we're just stuck with it now to </v>
<v Speaker 15>2016.</v>

2281
01:51:13.730 --> 01:51:14.563
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if hindu hinduism has no blast for </v>

2282
01:51:16.331 --> 01:51:18.680
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really only being used one way.</v>

2283
01:51:18.681 --> 01:51:20.900
<v Speaker 1>It really sort of has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>hinduism,</v>

2284
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:21.743
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2285
01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:22.511
<v Speaker 15>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's not.</v>

2286
01:51:22.511 --> 01:51:26.080
<v Speaker 15>But the tragedy is that even hindus or </v>
<v Speaker 15>started using this law,</v>

2287
01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:27.210
<v Speaker 15>that's the tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 15>See,</v>

2288
01:51:27.450 --> 01:51:28.080
<v Speaker 15>see,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I,</v>

2289
01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:29.530
<v Speaker 15>I,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I might be a skeptic,</v>

2290
01:51:29.531 --> 01:51:30.364
<v Speaker 15>but I don't consider myself to be </v>
<v Speaker 15>outside the hindu pantheon because you </v>

2291
01:51:33.961 --> 01:51:34.794
<v Speaker 15>know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>we don't have that abrahamic problem </v>

2292
01:51:36.041 --> 01:51:36.874
<v Speaker 15>where,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>

2293
01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:40.060
<v Speaker 15>18 are considered outside.</v>
<v Speaker 15>The abrahamic pantene.</v>

2294
01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:44.110
<v Speaker 15>Hinduism had a very old tradition of </v>
<v Speaker 15>atheism built in,</v>

2295
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:45.183
<v Speaker 15>in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It hurts me even more because I </v>

2296
01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:48.934
<v Speaker 15>considered myself to be a hindu and we </v>
<v Speaker 15>have this law and nobody talks about </v>

2297
01:51:52.071 --> 01:51:52.841
<v Speaker 15>her.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I'm in,</v>

2298
01:51:52.841 --> 01:51:54.840
<v Speaker 15>there have been rationalists who had to </v>
<v Speaker 15>live in the.</v>

2299
01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:58.650
<v Speaker 15>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 15>There was a rationalist calls and allah,</v>

2300
01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:01.210
<v Speaker 15>I don't know his second name,</v>
<v Speaker 15>but I know his name so now.</v>

2301
01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:02.253
<v Speaker 15>So he basically went around in 2012 when</v>
<v Speaker 15>he was talking about how certain </v>

2302
01:52:05.771 --> 01:52:08.020
<v Speaker 15>miracles claimed by christians were not </v>
<v Speaker 15>real,</v>

2303
01:52:08.290 --> 01:52:12.520
<v Speaker 15>so they use this law and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 15>down on him and he had to leave India.</v>

2304
01:52:12.521 --> 01:52:15.670
<v Speaker 15>He stays in Finland now.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And that's really sad.</v>

2305
01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:17.980
<v Speaker 15>Recently there was a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 15>kiko,</v>

2306
01:52:18.130 --> 01:52:21.190
<v Speaker 15>the.</v>
<v Speaker 15>He made fun of a guru.</v>

2307
01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:25.780
<v Speaker 15>So the followers of that guru,</v>
<v Speaker 15>they went after him again.</v>

2308
01:52:25.781 --> 01:52:30.190
<v Speaker 15>He had to apologize and I can give you </v>
<v Speaker 15>examples of various religions obviously.</v>

2309
01:52:30.191 --> 01:52:34.990
<v Speaker 15>I mean the highest amount of offense is </v>
<v Speaker 15>caused by a particular religion,</v>

2310
01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:36.910
<v Speaker 15>which nobody talks about.</v>

2311
01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

2312
01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:38.933
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of emails about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone knows which one you're </v>

2313
01:52:41.001 --> 01:52:43.160
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that you wrote that</v>

2314
01:52:43.161 --> 01:52:43.994
<v Speaker 1>I thought was really interesting you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said wanted to make the distinction </v>

2315
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:47.743
<v Speaker 1>between tolerance and mutual respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really thought that was </v>

2316
01:52:51.321 --> 01:52:52.154
<v Speaker 1>fascinating because here in America at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least we talk about tolerance all the </v>

2317
01:52:54.891 --> 01:52:56.690
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to tolerate everybody,</v>

2318
01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:59.420
<v Speaker 1>but in a way that's not a very lofty </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2319
01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Mutual respect is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you explain that?</v>

2320
01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.990
<v Speaker 15>So basically,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's not something that I've come up,</v>

2321
01:53:04.991 --> 01:53:07.540
<v Speaker 15>but it's a concept that was discussed </v>
<v Speaker 15>and uh,</v>

2322
01:53:07.541 --> 01:53:08.374
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>basically it's a concept introduced by </v>

2323
01:53:09.401 --> 01:53:11.950
<v Speaker 15>indian american author called reggie </v>
<v Speaker 15>mulatto.</v>

2324
01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:14.770
<v Speaker 15>He wrote a book called being different </v>
<v Speaker 15>in 2011.</v>

2325
01:53:15.070 --> 01:53:15.903
<v Speaker 15>So what he basically talks about is </v>
<v Speaker 15>every time we have an interfaith </v>

2326
01:53:18.190 --> 01:53:19.023
<v Speaker 15>dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 15>right?</v>

2327
01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:23.050
<v Speaker 15>So you have these interfaith dialogues </v>
<v Speaker 15>where everybody around the table test,</v>

2328
01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:25.030
<v Speaker 15>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 15>we tolerate all religions,</v>

2329
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:29.320
<v Speaker 15>spoke about it in a very beautiful way.</v>
<v Speaker 15>so the,</v>

2330
01:53:29.321 --> 01:53:31.030
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>he went around asking people,</v>

2331
01:53:31.210 --> 01:53:34.060
<v Speaker 15>so do you tolerate your spouse in your </v>
<v Speaker 15>house?</v>

2332
01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:36.970
<v Speaker 15>Do you tolerate someone when you're </v>
<v Speaker 15>having dinner with them?</v>

2333
01:53:37.230 --> 01:53:41.200
<v Speaker 15>So I have just basically taken this </v>
<v Speaker 15>concept being a skeptic.</v>

2334
01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:43.750
<v Speaker 15>Now I'm taking it to the next level and </v>
<v Speaker 15>I'm saying,</v>

2335
01:53:43.751 --> 01:53:44.680
<v Speaker 15>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 15>here I am.</v>

2336
01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:45.573
<v Speaker 15>I'm a skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I may not agree with some use of </v>

2337
01:53:47.831 --> 01:53:48.664
<v Speaker 15>hinduism.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I may not agree with a lot of views of </v>

2338
01:53:50.831 --> 01:53:51.664
<v Speaker 15>islam or christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 15>but very mutual respect comes in is I </v>

2339
01:53:54.881 --> 01:53:55.714
<v Speaker 15>don't need to tolerate you.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I need to respect you and you need to </v>

2340
01:53:58.181 --> 01:53:59.014
<v Speaker 15>give me that respect back in return.</v>
<v Speaker 15>That's when you have a dialogue </v>

2341
01:54:02.090 --> 01:54:04.690
<v Speaker 15>tolerances,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you're saying you suck,</v>

2342
01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.640
<v Speaker 15>but it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I'll let you be</v>

2343
01:54:06.810 --> 01:54:08.070
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I won't kill you.</v>

2344
01:54:08.071 --> 01:54:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much that's,</v>

2345
01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:14.590
<v Speaker 15>and this is again,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it stems from this exclusivist nature of</v>

2346
01:54:14.591 --> 01:54:16.210
<v Speaker 15>abrahamic religions.</v>
<v Speaker 15>See,</v>

2347
01:54:16.211 --> 01:54:19.090
<v Speaker 15>hindus don't have this problem and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 15>being very honest.</v>

2348
01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:22.380
<v Speaker 15>I mean I've never faced a hindu saying,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>

2349
01:54:22.381 --> 01:54:24.010
<v Speaker 15>I'm going to come across a hindu says,</v>
<v Speaker 15>oh,</v>

2350
01:54:24.011 --> 01:54:25.630
<v Speaker 15>I'll tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 15>You know,</v>

2351
01:54:25.631 --> 01:54:26.680
<v Speaker 15>hindus would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 15>okay,</v>

2352
01:54:26.681 --> 01:54:28.690
<v Speaker 15>you don't believe in god,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you do your own thing.</v>

2353
01:54:29.110 --> 01:54:31.390
<v Speaker 15>I'll do my own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 15>But you know,</v>

2354
01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:33.670
<v Speaker 15>it's not like one god,</v>
<v Speaker 15>one book,</v>

2355
01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:35.320
<v Speaker 15>one religion.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It's not that.</v>

2356
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:39.870
<v Speaker 1>So does that make the state of atheists </v>
<v Speaker 1>in India much stronger?</v>

2357
01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I did get,</v>

2358
01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:42.653
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably half of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that emailed us from India said they </v>

2359
01:54:45.061 --> 01:54:48.270
<v Speaker 1>were atheists and didn't make it sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were hiding per se.</v>

2360
01:54:48.271 --> 01:54:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you're doing this right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if hinduism,</v>

2361
01:54:51.091 --> 01:54:55.080
<v Speaker 1>which is 80 percent of the religion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>India is sort of tolerant of atheism.</v>

2362
01:54:55.081 --> 01:54:56.880
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty fantastiC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2363
01:54:57.690 --> 01:54:58.260
<v Speaker 15>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it is.</v>

2364
01:54:58.260 --> 01:54:59.093
<v Speaker 15>See,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I like to classify indian atheism in </v>

2365
01:55:00.961 --> 01:55:01.794
<v Speaker 15>three parts,</v>
<v Speaker 15>so there are the hindu atheist started </v>

2366
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:06.000
<v Speaker 15>the hindu dot skeptics.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I,</v>

2367
01:55:06.001 --> 01:55:09.530
<v Speaker 15>I call myself a skeptic,</v>
<v Speaker 15>so we,</v>

2368
01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:12.060
<v Speaker 15>we are not sure about some claims of </v>
<v Speaker 15>hinduism,</v>

2369
01:55:12.061 --> 01:55:15.180
<v Speaker 15>so I would say I'm skeptical to </v>
<v Speaker 15>reincarnation.</v>

2370
01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:18.870
<v Speaker 15>I'm skeptical to a few claims that the </v>
<v Speaker 15>gurus make,</v>

2371
01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:23.400
<v Speaker 15>but there are a lot of thIngs in </v>
<v Speaker 15>hinduism that are beautiful.</v>

2372
01:55:23.490 --> 01:55:28.490
<v Speaker 15>I mean I personally like the theory of </v>
<v Speaker 15>karma as a action and reaction.</v>

2373
01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:31.920
<v Speaker 15>I think a karma could be taken as an </v>
<v Speaker 15>action and reaction,</v>

2374
01:55:32.610 --> 01:55:36.480
<v Speaker 15>but then there are.</v>
<v Speaker 15>There's this new atheism in India,</v>

2375
01:55:36.481 --> 01:55:37.314
<v Speaker 15>I called them the marxist atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So basically you have to understand the </v>

2376
01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:45.030
<v Speaker 15>political scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 15>India and especially the media.</v>

2377
01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:48.060
<v Speaker 15>You have the social sciences and the </v>
<v Speaker 15>humanities departments.</v>

2378
01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.030
<v Speaker 15>They keep churning out these marxist </v>
<v Speaker 15>state tests.</v>

2379
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:52.103
<v Speaker 15>So when you got a lot of emails,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I wouldn't be surprised that you must </v>

2380
01:55:54.391 --> 01:55:56.730
<v Speaker 15>have gotten a lot of emails of those </v>
<v Speaker 15>marks.</v>

2381
01:55:56.731 --> 01:56:00.480
<v Speaker 15>The status will paint a very different </v>
<v Speaker 15>picture about hinduism to you.</v>

2382
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:03.820
<v Speaker 15>And then I have the third category,</v>
<v Speaker 15>which is the one,</v>

2383
01:56:03.870 --> 01:56:06.540
<v Speaker 15>the ats.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So that peRson has not read anything,</v>

2384
01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:11.930
<v Speaker 15>so they just probably saw a video offer,</v>
<v Speaker 15>richard dawkins on youtube and they must</v>

2385
01:56:11.991 --> 01:56:12.720
<v Speaker 15>have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 15>okay,</v>

2386
01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:14.340
<v Speaker 15>I like this,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>

2387
01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:16.033
<v Speaker 15>it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So I have three categorizations of </v>

2388
01:56:17.671 --> 01:56:20.700
<v Speaker 15>atheism in India that are mixed skeptic.</v>

2389
01:56:20.890 --> 01:56:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>

2390
01:56:22.110 --> 01:56:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we just started and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>my first person at a 20,</v>

2391
01:56:25.131 --> 01:56:27.580
<v Speaker 1>but our time is up already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I really,</v>

2392
01:56:27.581 --> 01:56:28.414
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate your support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate you coming on and sharing </v>

2393
01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:33.620
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts and I have got to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to India.</v>

2394
01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:35.660
<v Speaker 1>So when I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to look you up.</v>

2395
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:37.710
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 15>When you come to mumbai,</v>

2396
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.633
<v Speaker 15>dinner's on me.</v>

2397
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Done and done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2398
01:56:40.891 --> 01:56:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I am here with hannah in Texas in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good old us of a had.</v>

2399
01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:46.403
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>

2400
01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:48.490
<v Speaker 16>I am amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 16>How are you?</v>

2401
01:56:48.630 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2402
01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:51.293
<v Speaker 1>texaS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like Texas is like a whole </v>

2403
01:56:53.221 --> 01:56:55.530
<v Speaker 1>other country in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on in Texas?</v>

2404
01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:59.150
<v Speaker 16>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 16>honestly I think that we are better than</v>

2405
01:56:59.151 --> 01:57:02.270
<v Speaker 16>North Carolina right now.</v>
<v Speaker 16>That's pretty good.</v>

2406
01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:03.820
<v Speaker 16>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:06.830
<v Speaker 16>I mean like we get,</v>
<v Speaker 16>we get a lot of bad rap here.</v>

2408
01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:07.743
<v Speaker 16>um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but at the same time when you actually </v>

2409
01:57:09.171 --> 01:57:11.090
<v Speaker 16>live here,</v>
<v Speaker 16>it really depends on where you live.</v>

2410
01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:13.340
<v Speaker 16>Like Texas is bigger than like France or</v>
<v Speaker 16>something,</v>

2411
01:57:13.341 --> 01:57:16.880
<v Speaker 16>right?</v>
<v Speaker 16>So I live close to dallas.</v>

2412
01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:20.720
<v Speaker 16>I'm not super close but about an hour </v>
<v Speaker 16>away from that.</v>

2413
01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:22.850
<v Speaker 16>And the closer you are to these major </v>
<v Speaker 16>cities,</v>

2414
01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:23.713
<v Speaker 16>the better it is,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but whenever you start getting out to </v>

2415
01:57:25.641 --> 01:57:30.641
<v Speaker 16>the rural areas it gets kind of hickish </v>
<v Speaker 16>but they're good people.</v>

2416
01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:36.620
<v Speaker 16>It's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 16>well intentioned,</v>

2417
01:57:36.710 --> 01:57:38.900
<v Speaker 16>good old boys sort of thing going on.</v>

2418
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:40.783
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

2419
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:41.663
<v Speaker 1>I'll go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well your submission was really great </v>

2420
01:57:44.071 --> 01:57:45.810
<v Speaker 1>because you gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gave me a lot to work with you.</v>

2421
01:57:45.811 --> 01:57:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So first off you are trans big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are trans.</v>

2422
01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:52.440
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>yes.</v>

2423
01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:55.020
<v Speaker 16>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I put a little asterisk on that.</v>

2424
01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:55.913
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I am somebody who is very anti labels </v>

2425
01:57:58.831 --> 01:58:01.050
<v Speaker 16>and therE's a reason for this.</v>
<v Speaker 16>I'm not again,</v>

2426
01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:04.980
<v Speaker 16>special snowflakes stuff later,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but I don't know what I'm agreeing to.</v>

2427
01:58:04.981 --> 01:58:07.170
<v Speaker 16>Whenever I say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I'm trans.</v>

2428
01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:11.400
<v Speaker 16>I mean like how far does that go?</v>
<v Speaker 16>That's always the big question.</v>

2429
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:13.050
<v Speaker 16>Whenever you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 16>are you a trans man,</v>

2430
01:58:13.051 --> 01:58:14.400
<v Speaker 16>trans woman,</v>
<v Speaker 16>transsexual,</v>

2431
01:58:14.401 --> 01:58:15.560
<v Speaker 16>transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 16>across,</v>

2432
01:58:16.530 --> 01:58:20.190
<v Speaker 16>where are the lines?</v>
<v Speaker 16>You know what I to if I say yes,</v>

2433
01:58:20.191 --> 01:58:21.024
<v Speaker 16>I am that,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but in a colloquial general </v>

2434
01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:29.240
<v Speaker 16>understanding at the very basic level me</v>
<v Speaker 16>back just kind of stopped at the side.</v>

2435
01:58:31.090 --> 01:58:31.923
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actUally kind of freeing because </v>

2436
01:58:33.881 --> 01:58:34.714
<v Speaker 1>you as the person that identifies </v>
<v Speaker 1>however you want to write it as if </v>

2437
01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.360
<v Speaker 1>you're making the point of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2438
01:58:40.361 --> 01:58:44.600
<v Speaker 1>sometimes these are a little confusing </v>
<v Speaker 1>or don't quite get it right or all that.</v>

2439
01:58:45.290 --> 01:58:46.123
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile society is just obsessed with </v>

2440
01:58:47.861 --> 01:58:48.760
<v Speaker 1>these labels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2441
01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:50.623
<v Speaker 16>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 16>It's,</v>

2442
01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:54.230
<v Speaker 16>I have been doing this for close to nine</v>
<v Speaker 16>years now.</v>

2443
01:58:56.810 --> 01:59:01.810
<v Speaker 16>The thing with the internet is that you </v>
<v Speaker 16>don't really know who is typing what.</v>

2444
01:59:03.170 --> 01:59:06.200
<v Speaker 16>So for the,</v>
<v Speaker 16>for the most part,</v>

2445
01:59:06.230 --> 01:59:08.890
<v Speaker 16>a lot of the trans stuff that comes out </v>
<v Speaker 16>and people doing that,</v>

2446
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:09.743
<v Speaker 16>it's probably people just trying on a </v>
<v Speaker 16>persona or trying on an identity or </v>

2447
01:59:14.421 --> 01:59:17.240
<v Speaker 16>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 16>it's usually teenagers.</v>

2448
01:59:17.810 --> 01:59:18.643
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>and I think that we kind of take them a </v>

2449
01:59:21.390 --> 01:59:23.840
<v Speaker 16>little bit more seriously than we should</v>
<v Speaker 16>on a,</v>

2450
01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:27.130
<v Speaker 16>on a national hysteria type level.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>

2451
01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:31.490
<v Speaker 16>but I don't necessarily see that there's</v>
<v Speaker 16>much wrong with it,</v>

2452
01:59:31.491 --> 01:59:36.491
<v Speaker 16>but it just let it be what it is instead</v>
<v Speaker 16>of making a big deal out of it.</v>

2453
01:59:37.941 --> 01:59:40.280
<v Speaker 16>If it's online,</v>
<v Speaker 16>like in person stuff,</v>

2454
01:59:40.281 --> 01:59:45.281
<v Speaker 16>like real tangible happenings,</v>
<v Speaker 16>that gets a little bit more attention or</v>

2455
01:59:45.291 --> 01:59:46.124
<v Speaker 16>should.</v>
<v Speaker 16>But whenever people online typing or </v>

2456
01:59:48.951 --> 01:59:52.340
<v Speaker 16>posting or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 16>it's like it could be anybody.</v>

2457
01:59:54.250 --> 01:59:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Are you telling me that tumbler is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>real life?</v>

2458
01:59:56.661 --> 02:00:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're telling me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it'll blow your mind.</v>

2459
02:00:02.690 --> 02:00:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2460
02:00:03.651 --> 02:00:06.980
<v Speaker 1>you can be anything on the internet like</v>
<v Speaker 1>an attack helicopter.</v>

2461
02:00:06.981 --> 02:00:10.070
<v Speaker 1>That one's really popular now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a big one right now?</v>

2462
02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Identifying as an attack helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

2463
02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:14.960
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>

2464
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.823
<v Speaker 1>let's back up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for someone that's watching this </v>

2465
02:00:17.091 --> 02:00:18.370
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever theY are,</v>

2466
02:00:18.490 --> 02:00:19.323
<v Speaker 1>are in the world that has never heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a trans person or the only trans </v>

2467
02:00:22.701 --> 02:00:25.010
<v Speaker 1>person that they know of is caitlyn </v>
<v Speaker 1>jenner.</v>

2468
02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Can you jusT tell me a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up?</v>

2469
02:00:28.341 --> 02:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>When did you realize you were trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

2470
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:33.050
<v Speaker 1>This is always very difficult</v>

2471
02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:36.410
<v Speaker 16>because everybody's going to have like a</v>
<v Speaker 16>similar overarching narrative,</v>

2472
02:00:36.411 --> 02:00:39.560
<v Speaker 16>but it's going to have its different </v>
<v Speaker 16>details.</v>

2473
02:00:40.730 --> 02:00:44.740
<v Speaker 16>I knew something was off as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 16>which is one of those common narratives,</v>

2474
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:45.583
<v Speaker 16>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I grew up southern baptist and being </v>

2475
02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:52.190
<v Speaker 16>raised that way,</v>
<v Speaker 16>it's very kind of closed off.</v>

2476
02:00:52.250 --> 02:00:55.010
<v Speaker 16>Everybody that wasn't southern baptist </v>
<v Speaker 16>was influenced by the devil,</v>

2477
02:00:56.780 --> 02:01:00.290
<v Speaker 16>but we moved around a lot and all that </v>
<v Speaker 16>sort of thing.</v>

2478
02:01:01.190 --> 02:01:06.140
<v Speaker 16>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I don't know how to qualify myself.</v>

2479
02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:11.500
<v Speaker 16>Like we are kind of the only people it </v>
<v Speaker 16>seems nowadays where you have to explain</v>

2480
02:01:11.961 --> 02:01:12.794
<v Speaker 16>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 16>rationalized to me why I should accept </v>

2481
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:19.130
<v Speaker 16>that you are who you say you are,</v>

2482
02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are the ones at the moment,</v>

2483
02:01:20.791 --> 02:01:21.624
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that won't last forever for whatever </v>

2484
02:01:22.741 --> 02:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>that's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's one of those.</v>

2485
02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:26.073
<v Speaker 16>SeriouslY,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I wish I could give a definitive answer </v>

2486
02:01:29.541 --> 02:01:30.374
<v Speaker 16>like,</v>
<v Speaker 16>this is exactly how I know I can point </v>

2487
02:01:32.061 --> 02:01:35.210
<v Speaker 16>to these scientific studies.</v>
<v Speaker 16>This is exActly what happened.</v>

2488
02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:36.320
<v Speaker 16>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 16>we don't,</v>

2489
02:01:36.321 --> 02:01:37.154
<v Speaker 16>we're not there yet when I can point is </v>
<v Speaker 16>that trans people have existed </v>

2490
02:01:41.241 --> 02:01:43.990
<v Speaker 16>throughout history and multiple </v>
<v Speaker 16>cultures.</v>

2491
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.260
<v Speaker 16>This is not a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 16>It is only new to the american west.</v>

2492
02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:49.513
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>and what I mean by that is the modern </v>

2493
02:01:51.210 --> 02:01:52.043
<v Speaker 16>american west native tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 16>different allowances for different </v>

2494
02:01:55.401 --> 02:01:56.940
<v Speaker 16>genders and gender roles.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Sure.</v>

2495
02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:02.440
<v Speaker 16>So it's only new to the north american </v>
<v Speaker 16>west and I think that kinda goes back to</v>

2496
02:02:03.321 --> 02:02:06.530
<v Speaker 16>like a puritan european influence and </v>
<v Speaker 16>whatnot,</v>

2497
02:02:06.531 --> 02:02:11.531
<v Speaker 16>kind of scrounging all deviancy from,</v>
<v Speaker 16>uh,</v>

2498
02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:13.573
<v Speaker 16>the possibility of,</v>
<v Speaker 16>of human experience and I'm sure that </v>

2499
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:17.623
<v Speaker 16>there were people back there and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 16>white european colonials or whatever </v>

2500
02:02:22.401 --> 02:02:27.401
<v Speaker 16>that were also trans but could not say </v>
<v Speaker 16>anything or risk of being hung or killed</v>

2501
02:02:29.571 --> 02:02:30.760
<v Speaker 16>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Yeah.</v>

2502
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:31.260
<v Speaker 16>So</v>

2503
02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>

2504
02:02:32.410 --> 02:02:33.243
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of your sort of just mental </v>

2505
02:02:35.711 --> 02:02:36.544
<v Speaker 1>energy and an ability to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning person is about just having </v>

2506
02:02:39.791 --> 02:02:44.791
<v Speaker 1>to explain yourself because that seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>more exhausting in a way than,</v>

2507
02:02:45.190 --> 02:02:47.320
<v Speaker 1>than dealing with something personal.</v>

2508
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:52.630
<v Speaker 16>It is exhausting and it was exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 16>I think a Lot of trans people go through</v>

2509
02:02:52.660 --> 02:02:55.810
<v Speaker 16>very similar faces and their transition.</v>
<v Speaker 16>When I first started,</v>

2510
02:02:55.811 --> 02:02:56.644
<v Speaker 16>I was a helper.</v>
<v Speaker 16>I was going to be there for my trans </v>

2511
02:02:59.741 --> 02:03:03.670
<v Speaker 16>sisters who were just starting also,</v>
<v Speaker 16>um,</v>

2512
02:03:03.790 --> 02:03:04.623
<v Speaker 16>I spent a lot of night sleepless.</v>
<v Speaker 16>I'm trying to keep people from killing </v>

2513
02:03:08.741 --> 02:03:10.540
<v Speaker 16>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 16>um,</v>

2514
02:03:11.230 --> 02:03:15.190
<v Speaker 16>but also trying to educate and explain </v>
<v Speaker 16>and all this sort of thing.</v>

2515
02:03:15.370 --> 02:03:17.450
<v Speaker 16>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 16>as time went on and I,</v>

2516
02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:20.180
<v Speaker 16>I got more passing privilege as we call </v>
<v Speaker 16>it,</v>

2517
02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:25.220
<v Speaker 16>that I didn't have as many people </v>
<v Speaker 16>stopping me and asking me,</v>

2518
02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:28.630
<v Speaker 16>um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>and I kind of developed sort of a,</v>

2519
02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:29.473
<v Speaker 16>a passive routine of like,</v>
<v Speaker 16>this is how I'm just going to interact </v>

2520
02:03:33.101 --> 02:03:36.220
<v Speaker 16>with people and just be super kind,</v>
<v Speaker 16>super sweet and all that sort of thing.</v>

2521
02:03:36.221 --> 02:03:39.310
<v Speaker 16>And there's that pressure that you </v>
<v Speaker 16>always have to be on your,</v>

2522
02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:44.311
<v Speaker 16>a game as a transwoman and around the </v>
<v Speaker 16>normal people or whatever.</v>

2523
02:03:44.710 --> 02:03:46.240
<v Speaker 16>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>

2524
02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:48.700
<v Speaker 16>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 16>there's two camps on this.</v>

2525
02:03:48.730 --> 02:03:53.730
<v Speaker 16>There's the radical queers who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 16>we should not be trying to fit in.</v>

2526
02:03:53.801 --> 02:03:58.330
<v Speaker 16>We are unique in our own way and it's </v>
<v Speaker 16>beautiful and all this sort of thing.</v>

2527
02:03:58.331 --> 02:04:00.250
<v Speaker 16>And then there's the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 16>like,</v>

2528
02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:01.260
<v Speaker 16>well,</v>
<v Speaker 16>no I don't.</v>

2529
02:04:01.630 --> 02:04:02.463
<v Speaker 16>I kind of just want to fit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 16>It's difficult trying to navigate this </v>

2530
02:04:08.291 --> 02:04:10.600
<v Speaker 16>because it's very politicized.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Uh,</v>

2531
02:04:10.990 --> 02:04:15.010
<v Speaker 16>if you choose one side or the other or </v>
<v Speaker 16>you try to not pick a side,</v>

2532
02:04:15.011 --> 02:04:17.990
<v Speaker 16>nobody's going to like you and you end </v>
<v Speaker 16>up in your room all alone all the time.</v>

2533
02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

2534
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:20.683
<v Speaker 1>is that one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that one of the hardest things about </v>

2535
02:04:23.250 --> 02:04:24.083
<v Speaker 1>sort of being a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only being a minority in this </v>

2536
02:04:27.001 --> 02:04:29.310
<v Speaker 1>regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like as I said,</v>

2537
02:04:29.311 --> 02:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>trans issue seemed to be the minority of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment as you referenced before,</v>

2538
02:04:32.731 --> 02:04:35.220
<v Speaker 1>this issue with the bathrooms in North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolina.</v>

2539
02:04:35.250 --> 02:04:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Everything trans is know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes edge</v>

2540
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:39.143
<v Speaker 16>and it makes all the news.</v>
<v Speaker 16>So do you feel that you're under a </v>

2541
02:04:41.281 --> 02:04:44.700
<v Speaker 16>microscope even in just your private </v>
<v Speaker 16>life with everything that you do?</v>

2542
02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:45.660
<v Speaker 16>He.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Yes.</v>

2543
02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:47.190
<v Speaker 16>And here's,</v>
<v Speaker 16>here's the thing,</v>

2544
02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:51.660
<v Speaker 16>I have been using the women's restroom </v>
<v Speaker 16>for eight years without any issue.</v>

2545
02:04:52.290 --> 02:04:55.890
<v Speaker 16>Now I'm scared because now,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I mean that's interesting.</v>

2546
02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:00.720
<v Speaker 16>Now people are looking,</v>
<v Speaker 16>now people are scrutinizing and whenever</v>

2547
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:04.320
<v Speaker 16>governors or mayors or whoever it was in</v>
<v Speaker 16>North Carolina says,</v>

2548
02:05:04.590 --> 02:05:09.590
<v Speaker 16>women shouldn't spray people if they're </v>
<v Speaker 16>scared in the bathroom.</v>

2549
02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:12.180
<v Speaker 16>And a year,</v>
<v Speaker 16>a year ago,</v>

2550
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:13.183
<v Speaker 16>I'm a girl with a n,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I'm going to get in trouble for saying </v>

2551
02:05:16.561 --> 02:05:21.561
<v Speaker 16>this genetic girl with the vagina </v>
<v Speaker 16>actually got pulled out of a restroom by</v>

2552
02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:25.510
<v Speaker 16>men because could you say,</v>
<v Speaker 16>a genetic vagina?</v>

2553
02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:26.373
<v Speaker 16>So,</v>
<v Speaker 16>so a female regularly cis gendered </v>

2554
02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:31.130
<v Speaker 16>female.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Cisgender.</v>

2555
02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:34.500
<v Speaker 16>So there's so many words on perform her </v>
<v Speaker 16>femininity well enough.</v>

2556
02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.030
<v Speaker 16>Got it.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Right.</v>

2557
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:38.510
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>so that,</v>

2558
02:05:38.630 --> 02:05:39.463
<v Speaker 16>that's a specific issue and it always </v>
<v Speaker 16>makes me wonder whenever things like </v>

2559
02:05:41.881 --> 02:05:43.590
<v Speaker 16>this happening,</v>
<v Speaker 16>like what else is going on?</v>

2560
02:05:43.650 --> 02:05:44.483
<v Speaker 16>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 16>what are the real issues that are going </v>

2561
02:05:45.841 --> 02:05:48.000
<v Speaker 16>on right now whenever they put this </v>
<v Speaker 16>panic out here,</v>

2562
02:05:48.001 --> 02:05:51.030
<v Speaker 16>like we've been around all this time,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but just for now,</v>

2563
02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:53.910
<v Speaker 16>for some reason right now,</v>
<v Speaker 16>now we talk about this,</v>

2564
02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:55.980
<v Speaker 16>now we need to have this national </v>
<v Speaker 16>discussion.</v>

2565
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:58.720
<v Speaker 16>What's the real issUe?</v>
<v Speaker 16>Like what's,</v>

2566
02:05:58.750 --> 02:06:02.610
<v Speaker 16>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 16>I'm the new cycle is pretty quick.</v>

2567
02:06:02.611 --> 02:06:06.360
<v Speaker 16>So I think this one,</v>
<v Speaker 16>hopefully we're shifted out of this one.</v>

2568
02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:08.130
<v Speaker 16>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>

2569
02:06:08.630 --> 02:06:13.230
<v Speaker 16>it's the process and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I'm just saying this is blowing my mind.</v>

2570
02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:17.153
<v Speaker 16>So that's more of a specific issue and </v>
<v Speaker 16>in this like the trans experience is </v>

2571
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:23.783
<v Speaker 16>hugely diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 16>as diverse as the queer experience and </v>

2572
02:06:27.121 --> 02:06:31.620
<v Speaker 16>you're getting like who do you define as</v>
<v Speaker 16>trans because if you go with the tumbler</v>

2573
02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:32.633
<v Speaker 16>versions or whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 16>if you cross dress on halloween for </v>

2574
02:06:34.531 --> 02:06:35.364
<v Speaker 16>rocky horror picture show,</v>
<v Speaker 16>you qualify as trans now </v>

2575
02:06:36.931 --> 02:06:39.560
<v Speaker 16>congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>

2576
02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:40.693
<v Speaker 16>and you can't really say no,</v>
<v Speaker 16>you don't qualify if you're in that </v>

2577
02:06:43.891 --> 02:06:44.724
<v Speaker 16>community because suddenly you're </v>
<v Speaker 16>removing somebody's identity and you're </v>

2578
02:06:47.671 --> 02:06:49.470
<v Speaker 16>going to get in trouble for that and all</v>
<v Speaker 16>that sort of thing.</v>

2579
02:06:49.471 --> 02:06:50.304
<v Speaker 16>So I'm just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I need to accept the concept of </v>

2580
02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:53.753
<v Speaker 16>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 16>I don't know if you're familiar with </v>

2581
02:06:54.871 --> 02:06:55.630
<v Speaker 16>that,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but.</v>

2582
02:06:55.630 --> 02:06:57.020
<v Speaker 16>No.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Yeah,</v>

2583
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:58.650
<v Speaker 16>I quality as a term.</v>
<v Speaker 16>I'm kind of like,</v>

2584
02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:02.000
<v Speaker 16>I think so much that I'm an armchair </v>
<v Speaker 16>philosopher,</v>

2585
02:07:02.010 --> 02:07:06.910
<v Speaker 16>but quality was a,</v>
<v Speaker 16>a word that was coined that was to,</v>

2586
02:07:06.930 --> 02:07:10.590
<v Speaker 16>to describe the specific experience that</v>
<v Speaker 16>we each have.</v>

2587
02:07:10.650 --> 02:07:13.470
<v Speaker 16>So whenever you look at like a blue </v>
<v Speaker 16>wall,</v>

2588
02:07:13.650 --> 02:07:17.220
<v Speaker 16>you will have a certain range of </v>
<v Speaker 16>emotions and feelinGs and all that.</v>

2589
02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:22.700
<v Speaker 16>And I will have a supposedly different </v>
<v Speaker 16>one and that is quality so we can relate</v>

2590
02:07:23.581 --> 02:07:24.414
<v Speaker 16>that we're looking at a blue wall,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but whatever's invoked inside of us is </v>

2591
02:07:27.671 --> 02:07:28.504
<v Speaker 16>going to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 16>So that's kinda like the trans </v>

2592
02:07:30.391 --> 02:07:31.224
<v Speaker 16>experience in this.</v>
<v Speaker 16>The best I can do when it comes to </v>

2593
02:07:33.661 --> 02:07:38.661
<v Speaker 16>rationalizing it was like I just know </v>
<v Speaker 16>what I feel and I'm sorry that you can't</v>

2594
02:07:39.851 --> 02:07:41.860
<v Speaker 16>relate.</v>
<v Speaker 16>And again with the bathroom issue.</v>

2595
02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:44.080
<v Speaker 16>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Well listen,</v>

2596
02:07:44.110 --> 02:07:45.840
<v Speaker 16>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Oh go ahead.</v>

2597
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:46.783
<v Speaker 16>well I mean like I,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I appreciate people trying to relate to </v>

2598
02:07:48.611 --> 02:07:52.000
<v Speaker 16>the trans issues and like whenever they </v>
<v Speaker 16>think of the bathroom thing,</v>

2599
02:07:52.001 --> 02:07:55.000
<v Speaker 16>they're like why would I go to the </v>
<v Speaker 16>bathroom?</v>

2600
02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:56.950
<v Speaker 16>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 16>or why do I think people would go to the</v>

2601
02:07:56.951 --> 02:07:59.860
<v Speaker 16>bathroom first thing that comes to mind </v>
<v Speaker 16>while sexual assault or something.</v>

2602
02:07:59.861 --> 02:08:00.431
<v Speaker 16>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 16>And I'm like,</v>

2603
02:08:00.431 --> 02:08:01.264
<v Speaker 16>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 16>you should not get an address and go </v>

2604
02:08:02.291 --> 02:08:04.300
<v Speaker 16>into the bathroom then like a year </v>
<v Speaker 16>messed up.</v>

2605
02:08:05.670 --> 02:08:08.800
<v Speaker 1>There is one other thing that I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about that you mentioned in your</v>

2606
02:08:08.801 --> 02:08:10.570
<v Speaker 1>submission that I thought was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2607
02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:14.290
<v Speaker 1>You brought up a phrase that I hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard before called constructed illusion</v>

2608
02:08:14.650 --> 02:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>and you related this to having a male </v>
<v Speaker 1>and female voice</v>

2609
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:21.620
<v Speaker 16>when you may use each one.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Can you tell me about that?</v>

2610
02:08:22.650 --> 02:08:24.990
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>so this is what I'm.</v>

2611
02:08:25.190 --> 02:08:26.023
<v Speaker 16>people will call performing gender.</v>
<v Speaker 16>So I have developed this voice with </v>

2612
02:08:29.301 --> 02:08:31.160
<v Speaker 16>years of training.</v>
<v Speaker 16>It's still,</v>

2613
02:08:31.161 --> 02:08:34.410
<v Speaker 16>my voice is just exercised,</v>
<v Speaker 16>right?</v>

2614
02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:38.760
<v Speaker 16>my arms aren't exercised,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but um,</v>

2615
02:08:39.650 --> 02:08:40.483
<v Speaker 16>so I have a wider range.</v>
<v Speaker 16>So with this voice I get treated </v>

2616
02:08:42.891 --> 02:08:43.724
<v Speaker 16>different whenever I interact with </v>
<v Speaker 16>people because I'm not threatening with </v>

2617
02:08:45.831 --> 02:08:48.740
<v Speaker 16>this voice.</v>
<v Speaker 16>But if you're ready for this,</v>

2618
02:08:50.630 --> 02:08:54.380
<v Speaker 16>if I drop my voice,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I suddenly become a threats.</v>

2619
02:08:54.890 --> 02:08:58.430
<v Speaker 16>RiGht?</v>
<v Speaker 16>So I can switch between these two.</v>

2620
02:08:58.550 --> 02:09:01.880
<v Speaker 16>But that was the voice that's affected </v>
<v Speaker 16>by testosterone.</v>

2621
02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:07.220
<v Speaker 16>And anybody who heard that I am </v>
<v Speaker 16>immediately a different person.</v>

2622
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:09.080
<v Speaker 16>There is no going back,</v>
<v Speaker 16>right?</v>

2623
02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:10.453
<v Speaker 16>The illusion is broken,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but how do they know that's just not </v>

2624
02:09:14.541 --> 02:09:15.374
<v Speaker 16>another one of my develop voices.</v>
<v Speaker 16>And this is kind of why I call it </v>

2625
02:09:18.981 --> 02:09:22.700
<v Speaker 16>constructed illusion because if it's </v>
<v Speaker 16>related to magic tricks,</v>

2626
02:09:22.701 --> 02:09:23.534
<v Speaker 16>performance magic,</v>
<v Speaker 16>you do mr [inaudible] and all that sort </v>

2627
02:09:25.971 --> 02:09:26.804
<v Speaker 16>of thing.</v>

2628
02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:27.913
<v Speaker 16>And it is a performance in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but in another sense it is me and it's </v>

2629
02:09:33.681 --> 02:09:37.430
<v Speaker 16>really hard to really unpack that in a </v>
<v Speaker 16>short amount of time.</v>

2630
02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:42.260
<v Speaker 16>But it's inter subjectivity with my </v>
<v Speaker 16>voice.</v>

2631
02:09:42.261 --> 02:09:43.094
<v Speaker 16>It was for me at first,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but eventually I kind of start feelinG </v>

2632
02:09:45.861 --> 02:09:48.920
<v Speaker 16>trapped by it because even though I've </v>
<v Speaker 16>exercised this place,</v>

2633
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:54.310
<v Speaker 16>I'm still not capable of a full ranGe of</v>
<v Speaker 16>emotional expression using it.</v>

2634
02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:55.610
<v Speaker 16>Makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Right.</v>

2635
02:09:55.611 --> 02:09:56.444
<v Speaker 16>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I assume that there's an evolution with </v>

2636
02:09:57.351 --> 02:09:57.771
<v Speaker 16>that,</v>
<v Speaker 16>right?</v>

2637
02:09:57.771 --> 02:09:58.820
<v Speaker 16>Like you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 16>you'll get there,</v>

2638
02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:02.090
<v Speaker 16>so to speak eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but it takes a lot,</v>

2639
02:10:02.091 --> 02:10:03.350
<v Speaker 16>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 16>a lot of practice.</v>

2640
02:10:03.710 --> 02:10:04.543
<v Speaker 16>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 16>this goes back into like passing </v>

2641
02:10:05.901 --> 02:10:10.901
<v Speaker 16>privilege and all that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 16>So it was really nice talking to you and</v>

2642
02:10:11.601 --> 02:10:14.180
<v Speaker 16>I probably talk talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 16>So ecstatic.</v>

2643
02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on with jason and brussels.</v>

2644
02:10:16.441 --> 02:10:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has it gone?</v>

2645
02:10:17.970 --> 02:10:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pleasure to be on.</v>

2646
02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:21.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2647
02:10:21.301 --> 02:10:23.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to talk to you.</v>

2648
02:10:23.191 --> 02:10:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So you are in brussels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but originally from cypress.</v>

2649
02:10:26.491 --> 02:10:28.860
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get to Cyprus in a minute</v>

2650
02:10:28.861 --> 02:10:29.694
<v Speaker 1>because nobody talks about Cyprus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a really interesting tiny </v>

2651
02:10:31.981 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>little country that very people know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a,</v>

2652
02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:35.073
<v Speaker 1>but you're in brussels now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the last few months in </v>

2653
02:10:37.491 --> 02:10:38.324
<v Speaker 1>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially in brussels have been </v>

2654
02:10:40.071 --> 02:10:42.140
<v Speaker 1>very tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you just start with that?</v>

2655
02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:44.073
<v Speaker 17>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 17>yeah,</v>

2656
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:46.930
<v Speaker 17>I have to say it hasn't affected people </v>
<v Speaker 17>on a,</v>

2657
02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:47.933
<v Speaker 17>on a conscious level.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I mean you see people going about their </v>

2658
02:10:49.751 --> 02:10:52.960
<v Speaker 17>daily routine,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but it's definitely had a very malicious</v>

2659
02:10:52.961 --> 02:10:57.820
<v Speaker 17>sort of subconscious undertone,</v>
<v Speaker 17>particularly since the paris attacks.</v>

2660
02:10:58.230 --> 02:10:59.063
<v Speaker 17>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 17>we've had a martial law on and off and </v>

2661
02:11:03.251 --> 02:11:04.084
<v Speaker 17>it's very concerning when you see four </v>
<v Speaker 17>armed soldiers outside mcdonalds and an </v>

2662
02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.670
<v Speaker 17>armored car outside your workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Yeah.</v>

2663
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:13.800
<v Speaker 17>So,</v>
<v Speaker 17>um,</v>

2664
02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:14.520
<v Speaker 17>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 17>it's,</v>

2665
02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:15.353
<v Speaker 17>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 17>it's been very strange and the attacks </v>

2666
02:11:17.410 --> 02:11:21.130
<v Speaker 17>actually happened at a metro station </v>
<v Speaker 17>that I use quite frequently.</v>

2667
02:11:22.210 --> 02:11:25.990
<v Speaker 1>So when you see these changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see more soldiers out there,</v>

2668
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.510
<v Speaker 1>you see more security and all that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>

2669
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:29.703
<v Speaker 1>How does that change your general psyche</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that you're walking to work and </v>

2670
02:11:32.831 --> 02:11:33.664
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changes just sort of the day to day </v>

2671
02:11:36.131 --> 02:11:36.964
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2672
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:37.551
<v Speaker 17>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 17>no,</v>

2673
02:11:37.551 --> 02:11:40.210
<v Speaker 17>you become accustomed to it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but uh,</v>

2674
02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:43.280
<v Speaker 17>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 17>it's very disturbing to see the military</v>

2675
02:11:43.281 --> 02:11:46.520
<v Speaker 17>deployed in a western capital,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2676
02:11:47.110 --> 02:11:50.600
<v Speaker 17>I mean it's like the problem is truly </v>
<v Speaker 17>have become a global,</v>

2677
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:57.390
<v Speaker 1>so there were a lot of reports after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks in brussels that in parts of the</v>

2678
02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>community that one of the attackers was </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

2679
02:12:01.091 --> 02:12:04.510
<v Speaker 1>and I guess they found him a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks later that the community there was</v>

2680
02:12:04.511 --> 02:12:08.140
<v Speaker 1>knowingly hiding him were people talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that in Belgium.</v>

2681
02:12:08.141 --> 02:12:11.380
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of trickled it's way into </v>
<v Speaker 1>western media but not really.</v>

2682
02:12:11.381 --> 02:12:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And then it was kind of hard to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>what was actually true.</v>

2683
02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:15.813
<v Speaker 17>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 17>I don't think that he's just a problem </v>

2684
02:12:17.141 --> 02:12:19.390
<v Speaker 17>that's isolated to Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I think in general,</v>

2685
02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:20.493
<v Speaker 17>um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>we don't see a members of the local </v>

2686
02:12:23.251 --> 02:12:27.300
<v Speaker 17>community where many of these suspects </v>
<v Speaker 17>from turning them in,</v>

2687
02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:28.753
<v Speaker 17>making a concerted effort with the </v>
<v Speaker 17>authority and it is something that we </v>

2688
02:12:33.870 --> 02:12:37.170
<v Speaker 17>have to try and deal with through better</v>
<v Speaker 17>integration policies.</v>

2689
02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:39.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how is the integration going,</v>

2690
02:12:39.741 --> 02:12:40.970
<v Speaker 1>I guess?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess to that point,</v>

2691
02:12:40.971 --> 02:12:42.320
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not going that great.</v>

2692
02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:43.591
<v Speaker 17>No,</v>
<v Speaker 17>no,</v>

2693
02:12:43.591 --> 02:12:44.424
<v Speaker 17>no,</v>
<v Speaker 17>it's terrible.</v>

2694
02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:46.680
<v Speaker 17>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 17>you have different communities that live</v>

2695
02:12:46.681 --> 02:12:48.460
<v Speaker 17>parallel lives,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2696
02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:49.820
<v Speaker 17>which,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2697
02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:51.570
<v Speaker 17>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 17>they,</v>

2698
02:12:51.590 --> 02:12:54.200
<v Speaker 17>they exist occasionally in the physical </v>
<v Speaker 17>space because,</v>

2699
02:12:54.230 --> 02:12:55.063
<v Speaker 17>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 17>you opened the physical spaces overlap </v>

2700
02:12:56.811 --> 02:12:57.644
<v Speaker 17>slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but they just live in a different </v>

2701
02:12:59.271 --> 02:13:00.104
<v Speaker 17>reality.</v>

2702
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much of That,</v>

2703
02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:04.320
<v Speaker 1>where do you place all the blame on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

2704
02:13:04.321 --> 02:13:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Because this is one of the things that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people emailed us about was,</v>

2705
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:08.303
<v Speaker 1>was this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially people in europe were saying </v>

2706
02:13:10.770 --> 02:13:15.300
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of the muslIm communities </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't integrating properly and they see</v>

2707
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:17.490
<v Speaker 1>some people were sort of blaming their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own governments.</v>

2708
02:13:17.491 --> 02:13:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Some people were blaming the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2709
02:13:19.831 --> 02:13:21.270
<v Speaker 1>the muslim communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2710
02:13:21.330 --> 02:13:23.490
<v Speaker 1>my guess is that the truth is somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>in between.</v>

2711
02:13:23.491 --> 02:13:24.324
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

2712
02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:25.173
<v Speaker 17>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 17>I like to go from more abstractly and </v>

2713
02:13:26.661 --> 02:13:28.580
<v Speaker 17>say that the problem has been,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2714
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:34.030
<v Speaker 17>because of our social justice approach </v>
<v Speaker 17>or rather aggressive approach giving,</v>

2715
02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:40.500
<v Speaker 17>we've been giving rights to a </v>
<v Speaker 17>communities rather than two individuals.</v>

2716
02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:44.580
<v Speaker 17>And it's very arbitrary to,</v>
<v Speaker 17>to define a community in a certain way.</v>

2717
02:13:45.130 --> 02:13:46.440
<v Speaker 17>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and um,</v>

2718
02:13:47.190 --> 02:13:48.023
<v Speaker 17>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 17>because the premise of our </v>

2719
02:13:49.411 --> 02:13:52.440
<v Speaker 17>individualized kind of rule of law has </v>
<v Speaker 17>been,</v>

2720
02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:53.893
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 17>the rights should be given to </v>

2721
02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:58.380
<v Speaker 17>individuals and not to,</v>
<v Speaker 17>um,</v>

2722
02:13:58.950 --> 02:14:00.780
<v Speaker 17>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 17>what social justice people,</v>

2723
02:14:01.890 --> 02:14:04.560
<v Speaker 17>however,</v>
<v Speaker 17>social justice people decide to classify</v>

2724
02:14:04.561 --> 02:14:05.430
<v Speaker 17>people as.</v>

2725
02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:08.350
<v Speaker 1>So how much have those ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly you're,</v>

2726
02:14:08.351 --> 02:14:10.700
<v Speaker 1>you're speaking my language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the individual,</v>

2727
02:14:10.701 --> 02:14:13.520
<v Speaker 1>not the group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get away from this oppression,</v>

2728
02:14:13.521 --> 02:14:14.354
<v Speaker 1>olympics thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff which we've talked </v>

2729
02:14:15.891 --> 02:14:20.120
<v Speaker 1>about so much here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that ideology is,</v>

2730
02:14:20.121 --> 02:14:21.770
<v Speaker 1>has taken hold in Belgium?</v>

2731
02:14:23.330 --> 02:14:24.300
<v Speaker 17>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 17>I'm,</v>

2732
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:25.030
<v Speaker 17>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 17>I'm,</v>

2733
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.863
<v Speaker 17>I'm more qualified to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 17>specifically about how this is </v>

2734
02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:34.180
<v Speaker 17>manifested in the uk because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 17>doing a study on that.</v>

2735
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.863
<v Speaker 1>So you've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been studying this in the uk </v>

2736
02:14:37.131 --> 02:14:39.140
<v Speaker 1>about a school system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2737
02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:40.410
<v Speaker 17>System,</v>
<v Speaker 17>yeah.</v>

2738
02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:42.690
<v Speaker 17>Because in the,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2739
02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:43.593
<v Speaker 17>in the british school system,</v>
<v Speaker 17>what you have is you have a third of </v>

2740
02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:46.293
<v Speaker 17>schools which are regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 17>which are faith schools that receive </v>

2741
02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:50.780
<v Speaker 17>public money,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2742
02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:51.920
<v Speaker 17>because,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2743
02:14:51.921 --> 02:14:54.200
<v Speaker 17>they have designated a religious </v>
<v Speaker 17>character.</v>

2744
02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:55.933
<v Speaker 17>And what we see here is that I believe </v>
<v Speaker 17>that the child's rights are being </v>

2745
02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:05.300
<v Speaker 17>infringed upon because,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2746
02:15:05.450 --> 02:15:08.600
<v Speaker 17>basically because the child is </v>
<v Speaker 17>classified as,</v>

2747
02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:11.850
<v Speaker 17>as belonging to a particular community,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2748
02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:15.530
<v Speaker 17>they get labeled by very arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 17>criteria,</v>

2749
02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:17.950
<v Speaker 17>um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and um,</v>

2750
02:15:18.340 --> 02:15:23.340
<v Speaker 17>and attend a faith schools just to </v>
<v Speaker 17>fulfill the aims of social justice.</v>

2751
02:15:27.891 --> 02:15:32.450
<v Speaker 17>And I think that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 17>this is a very large structural problem.</v>

2752
02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:35.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarrely backwards thing that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do in the west.</v>

2753
02:15:35.481 --> 02:15:36.314
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do this in America with several </v>

2754
02:15:37.281 --> 02:15:38.114
<v Speaker 1>religions where the government funds </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of faith based schools even though </v>

2755
02:15:41.931 --> 02:15:43.880
<v Speaker 1>we're totally secular society.</v>

2756
02:15:45.250 --> 02:15:46.083
<v Speaker 17>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 17>yes.</v>

2757
02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:48.470
<v Speaker 17>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and you know,</v>

2758
02:15:48.850 --> 02:15:50.350
<v Speaker 17>shockingly,</v>
<v Speaker 17>in the uk,</v>

2759
02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:53.000
<v Speaker 17>the faith goals have a,</v>
<v Speaker 17>have a,</v>

2760
02:15:53.150 --> 02:15:55.900
<v Speaker 17>have an exemption from,</v>
<v Speaker 17>from even the equality act.</v>

2761
02:15:55.901 --> 02:15:56.734
<v Speaker 17>I mean it's written in the law that they</v>
<v Speaker 17>have an exemption from treating people </v>

2762
02:16:00.461 --> 02:16:02.800
<v Speaker 17>equally and employment and,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and admission.</v>

2763
02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.863
<v Speaker 17>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 17>the problem is although the schools are </v>

2764
02:16:06.971 --> 02:16:08.800
<v Speaker 17>obliged to teach the national </v>
<v Speaker 17>curriculum,</v>

2765
02:16:08.830 --> 02:16:09.663
<v Speaker 17>they teach it through a religious lens.</v>
<v Speaker 17>So you might learn about many secular </v>

2766
02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:14.333
<v Speaker 17>subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but then about other religions and </v>

2767
02:16:16.861 --> 02:16:19.740
<v Speaker 17>secularism and how to behave in a civic </v>
<v Speaker 17>society.</v>

2768
02:16:19.741 --> 02:16:20.574
<v Speaker 17>But if you also learned that the penalty</v>
<v Speaker 17>for apostasy is death and that the law </v>

2769
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:28.360
<v Speaker 17>and that the law of god,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2770
02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:31.900
<v Speaker 17>in the arEa above the,</v>
<v Speaker 17>the law of the state,</v>

2771
02:16:32.410 --> 02:16:33.243
<v Speaker 17>then you're less likely to want to </v>
<v Speaker 17>integrate and be part of the cohesive </v>

2772
02:16:36.401 --> 02:16:37.210
<v Speaker 17>society.</v>

2773
02:16:37.210 --> 02:16:37.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2774
02:16:37.871 --> 02:16:38.704
<v Speaker 3>to me that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets to the heart of the social </v>

2775
02:16:40.271 --> 02:16:43.390
<v Speaker 3>justice stuff because it seeps into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>education system.</v>

2776
02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Then you have a government that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsidizing basically religious teachinG</v>

2777
02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:50.560
<v Speaker 3>a suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2778
02:16:50.590 --> 02:16:51.423
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's move away from that for a </v>

2779
02:16:51.961 --> 02:16:53.590
<v Speaker 3>little because I do want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cyprus with you.</v>

2780
02:16:53.591 --> 02:16:58.060
<v Speaker 3>So nobody knows about cypress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a tiny little island country.</v>

2781
02:16:58.240 --> 02:16:59.073
<v Speaker 3>You're from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just tell me a little bit about your </v>

2782
02:17:00.491 --> 02:17:01.324
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to give me the whole </v>

2783
02:17:01.661 --> 02:17:02.870
<v Speaker 3>history of cypress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2784
02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:04.640
<v Speaker 3>but tell me a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you the,</v>

2785
02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:06.920
<v Speaker 17>the recent history that most,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2786
02:17:07.770 --> 02:17:09.260
<v Speaker 17>significant now.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Yeah.</v>

2787
02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:10.221
<v Speaker 17>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 17>yeah.</v>

2788
02:17:10.221 --> 02:17:11.780
<v Speaker 17>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 17>in 1974,</v>

2789
02:17:11.781 --> 02:17:12.614
<v Speaker 17>the turkish army occupied half of </v>
<v Speaker 17>cypress and the island has been divided </v>

2790
02:17:17.331 --> 02:17:18.164
<v Speaker 17>since then.</v>
<v Speaker 17>The turkish state installed a kind of </v>

2791
02:17:22.341 --> 02:17:25.760
<v Speaker 17>fag republic that's only recognized by </v>
<v Speaker 17>Turkey and Pakistan.</v>

2792
02:17:26.630 --> 02:17:27.600
<v Speaker 17>And,</v>
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>

2793
02:17:27.670 --> 02:17:31.250
<v Speaker 17>have been ongoing attempts to resolve </v>
<v Speaker 17>the situation,</v>

2794
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:32.840
<v Speaker 17>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 17>over the decades,</v>

2795
02:17:33.470 --> 02:17:34.380
<v Speaker 17>but,</v>
<v Speaker 17>um,</v>

2796
02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:35.953
<v Speaker 17>I feel that I'm not very optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 17>about the two sides coming through a </v>

2797
02:17:39.261 --> 02:17:42.560
<v Speaker 17>settlement because of the physical power</v>
<v Speaker 17>that Turkey is exerting.</v>

2798
02:17:42.561 --> 02:17:43.394
<v Speaker 17>I think whether Turkey withdraws or not,</v>
<v Speaker 17>it's mainly a subject of the trajectory </v>

2799
02:17:49.071 --> 02:17:52.010
<v Speaker 17>of turkish foreign policy and whether </v>
<v Speaker 17>it's in turkey's interest to leave.</v>

2800
02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:54.133
<v Speaker 17>and my hope is that because turkish </v>
<v Speaker 17>foreign policy has become increasingly </v>

2801
02:17:58.690 --> 02:18:03.690
<v Speaker 17>islamophobia and it's shifting away from</v>
<v Speaker 17>the foreign policy of the west,</v>

2802
02:18:04.610 --> 02:18:05.443
<v Speaker 17>that the west might slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and I suppose there's a growing </v>

2803
02:18:08.961 --> 02:18:09.794
<v Speaker 17>relationship between Cyprus and Israel </v>
<v Speaker 17>and my hope is that the west eventually </v>

2804
02:18:13.461 --> 02:18:14.294
<v Speaker 17>aligns its foreign policy closer to </v>
<v Speaker 17>secularist entities throughout the </v>

2805
02:18:20.271 --> 02:18:23.600
<v Speaker 17>region,</v>
<v Speaker 17>like the kurds for example also.</v>

2806
02:18:24.310 --> 02:18:25.143
<v Speaker 17>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and my hope is that that will will lead </v>

2807
02:18:27.741 --> 02:18:29.060
<v Speaker 17>to a better.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Um,</v>

2808
02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:30.733
<v Speaker 17>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 17>we'll give cypress leverage in </v>

2809
02:18:33.951 --> 02:18:37.150
<v Speaker 17>negotiations because it will have the </v>
<v Speaker 17>backing from the west list.</v>

2810
02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:37.590
<v Speaker 17>So</v>

2811
02:18:37.590 --> 02:18:38.071
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2812
02:18:38.071 --> 02:18:39.990
<v Speaker 3>I promise you that I will talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>more because,</v>

2813
02:18:39.991 --> 02:18:41.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about the kurds here,</v>

2814
02:18:41.341 --> 02:18:44.040
<v Speaker 3>but as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cypress is a sovereign nation,</v>

2815
02:18:44.041 --> 02:18:49.041
<v Speaker 3>a united nations member country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's in full occupation since 1974.</v>

2816
02:18:49.471 --> 02:18:50.700
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

2817
02:18:50.770 --> 02:18:52.800
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot more that we could talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about unfortunately.</v>

2818
02:18:52.860 --> 02:18:54.840
<v Speaker 3>We got to move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a long day of interviews,</v>

2819
02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:57.330
<v Speaker 3>but it's been a pleasure talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2820
02:18:57.331 --> 02:18:59.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm on with gel up in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jill.</v>

2821
02:18:59.220 --> 02:19:00.690
<v Speaker 3>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good,</v>

2822
02:19:00.691 --> 02:19:03.150
<v Speaker 3>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's good to have you here now.</v>

2823
02:19:03.151 --> 02:19:05.160
<v Speaker 3>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we get into any of the issues you</v>

2824
02:19:05.161 --> 02:19:08.700
<v Speaker 3>emailed me about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it true that Canada is going to build</v>

2825
02:19:08.701 --> 02:19:12.570
<v Speaker 3>a wall to keep americans out regardless </v>
<v Speaker 3>of who wins our presidential election?</v>

2826
02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:16.200
<v Speaker 3>I've heard rumors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2827
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rumors.</v>

2828
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:19.830
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get that on the internet.</v>

2829
02:19:20.010 --> 02:19:20.843
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you sent me some really interesting </v>

2830
02:19:21.751 --> 02:19:22.584
<v Speaker 3>stuff that sort of touched on some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that we talk about on the </v>

2831
02:19:25.171 --> 02:19:27.650
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you really went in another with</v>

2832
02:19:27.651 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which</v>

2833
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:28.813
<v Speaker 1>is why I wanted to have you on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you mentioned a is </v>

2834
02:19:31.221 --> 02:19:32.054
<v Speaker 1>that sort of the mental health anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>stigma campaigns that we see these days </v>

2835
02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:41.060
<v Speaker 1>are actually part of the regressive left</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>

2836
02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:42.133
<v Speaker 1>Now I gave a lot of buzzwords there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you unpack that for me a little </v>

2837
02:19:44.391 --> 02:19:45.224
<v Speaker 1>bit?</v>

2838
02:19:46.090 --> 02:19:48.790
<v Speaker 18>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Not very many people,</v>

2839
02:19:48.791 --> 02:19:51.240
<v Speaker 18>um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>agree with me on it.</v>

2840
02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:52.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

2841
02:19:52.211 --> 02:19:53.044
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

2842
02:19:53.140 --> 02:19:56.410
<v Speaker 18>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 18>it's the same sort of victim mentality,</v>

2843
02:19:56.890 --> 02:19:57.723
<v Speaker 18>um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>except pretty much anyone can be a part </v>

2844
02:20:01.451 --> 02:20:02.284
<v Speaker 18>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 18>It seems almost like a club to be </v>

2845
02:20:04.061 --> 02:20:07.480
<v Speaker 18>mentally ill these days and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 18>times it's,</v>

2846
02:20:07.481 --> 02:20:11.410
<v Speaker 18>ignores the real issues.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Like right now I'm in Canada,</v>

2847
02:20:11.430 --> 02:20:14.860
<v Speaker 18>we have a huge crisis with the first </v>
<v Speaker 18>nations communities,</v>

2848
02:20:15.370 --> 02:20:18.070
<v Speaker 18>like lots of youth are committing </v>
<v Speaker 18>suicide,</v>

2849
02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:19.713
<v Speaker 18>but of course the anti stigma campaigns </v>
<v Speaker 18>want to hijack this and make it about </v>

2850
02:20:22.690 --> 02:20:25.510
<v Speaker 18>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 18>But if you actually talk to these youth,</v>

2851
02:20:25.511 --> 02:20:27.010
<v Speaker 18>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 18>well,</v>

2852
02:20:27.011 --> 02:20:29.280
<v Speaker 18>we have no hope because there is no hope</v>
<v Speaker 18>here.</v>

2853
02:20:29.290 --> 02:20:31.480
<v Speaker 18>We have no jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 18>we have no library,</v>

2854
02:20:31.481 --> 02:20:33.610
<v Speaker 18>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>

2855
02:20:33.611 --> 02:20:34.444
<v Speaker 18>so I think just the campaigns tend to </v>
<v Speaker 18>really stay away from the issues and </v>

2856
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:42.280
<v Speaker 18>tend to put people again in the victim </v>
<v Speaker 18>role.</v>

2857
02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:43.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're sort of talking about two </v>

2858
02:20:44.181 --> 02:20:45.014
<v Speaker 1>things there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on one hand there's the feeling if </v>

2859
02:20:47.091 --> 02:20:51.010
<v Speaker 1>the economy is not good or their family </v>
<v Speaker 1>life isn't good or whatever it is,</v>

2860
02:20:51.011 --> 02:20:51.844
<v Speaker 1>it is sort of a reality in their life </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus these campaigns that in a weird </v>

2861
02:20:55.941 --> 02:20:59.270
<v Speaker 1>way because of this oppression olympics </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've talked about,</v>

2862
02:20:59.510 --> 02:21:00.343
<v Speaker 1>kind of make it cool to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is wrong with me or this is </v>

2863
02:21:03.201 --> 02:21:05.240
<v Speaker 1>wrong with me or I have this or this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2864
02:21:05.241 --> 02:21:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2865
02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:08.170
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 18>There seems to be a bit of a hierarchy.</v>

2866
02:21:08.171 --> 02:21:13.171
<v Speaker 18>Like it's more cool to be like bipolar </v>
<v Speaker 18>then to be depressed and,</v>

2867
02:21:14.170 --> 02:21:17.560
<v Speaker 18>and they seem to be seeing except me </v>
<v Speaker 18>because I'm not like you.</v>

2868
02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:21.790
<v Speaker 18>Whereas we all know like the way towards</v>
<v Speaker 18>acceptance is to be,</v>

2869
02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:23.170
<v Speaker 18>well we're,</v>
<v Speaker 18>we're all human,</v>

2870
02:21:23.171 --> 02:21:25.390
<v Speaker 18>we're all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 18>But um,</v>

2871
02:21:26.170 --> 02:21:31.170
<v Speaker 18>they're really going for no because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 18>different and it's not my fault.</v>

2872
02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:36.670
<v Speaker 18>So sort of for people who don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 18>illness,</v>

2873
02:21:36.671 --> 02:21:37.504
<v Speaker 18>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 18>If they're struggling that they </v>

2874
02:21:39.221 --> 02:21:40.720
<v Speaker 18>shouldn't be accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 18>So.</v>

2875
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really kind of fascinating.</v>

2876
02:21:42.531 --> 02:21:45.730
<v Speaker 1>So someone who doesn't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2877
02:21:45.770 --> 02:21:46.603
<v Speaker 1>any known condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak in a weird way then then it </v>

2878
02:21:49.851 --> 02:21:52.760
<v Speaker 1>feels worse for them because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to feel okay,</v>

2879
02:21:52.761 --> 02:21:53.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2880
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:54.500
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>

2881
02:21:54.740 --> 02:21:55.573
<v Speaker 18>And there's a lot of research showing </v>
<v Speaker 18>that the more we sort of give people </v>

2882
02:22:00.861 --> 02:22:03.520
<v Speaker 18>these information about these elements </v>
<v Speaker 18>to some more,</v>

2883
02:22:04.090 --> 02:22:05.930
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>we create them in people,</v>

2884
02:22:06.250 --> 02:22:07.250
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>because it's,</v>

2885
02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:08.113
<v Speaker 18>it's very much cultural and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but they just have to get a brain scan </v>

2886
02:22:13.431 --> 02:22:16.160
<v Speaker 18>and people pay attention because they </v>
<v Speaker 18>think that science.</v>

2887
02:22:16.290 --> 02:22:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys have the,</v>

2888
02:22:17.491 --> 02:22:19.710
<v Speaker 1>all the crazy commercials that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the states,</v>

2889
02:22:19.711 --> 02:22:20.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you turn on the tv,</v>

2890
02:22:20.611 --> 02:22:21.444
<v Speaker 1>especially any of the cable news shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the commercials are for one </v>

2891
02:22:23.851 --> 02:22:25.830
<v Speaker 1>depression medicine or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2892
02:22:25.831 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 1>there's</v>

2893
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:26.843
<v Speaker 3>a cartoon cloud following somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 3>take this medication with this </v>

2894
02:22:30.031 --> 02:22:30.864
<v Speaker 3>medication and it makes everybody think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're depressed or somehow </v>

2895
02:22:34.381 --> 02:22:35.214
<v Speaker 3>defective.</v>

2896
02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:37.420
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I don't watch tv,</v>

2897
02:22:37.421 --> 02:22:39.640
<v Speaker 18>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I'm sure we did have those.</v>

2898
02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:40.240
<v Speaker 18>Your,</v>

2899
02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:42.160
<v Speaker 3>you're a wise woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2900
02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:43.053
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of this though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what you wrote to me is very </v>

2901
02:22:44.561 --> 02:22:48.100
<v Speaker 3>personal for you because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>recovering addict yourself,</v>

2902
02:22:48.101 --> 02:22:49.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2903
02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:51.430
<v Speaker 3>so can you tell me a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2904
02:22:51.450 --> 02:22:53.080
<v Speaker 3>that either a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2905
02:22:53.081 --> 02:22:54.820
<v Speaker 3>what you were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you got out,</v>

2906
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:55.783
<v Speaker 3>cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to give me every bit of </v>

2907
02:22:57.491 --> 02:22:58.380
<v Speaker 3>personal stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2908
02:22:58.440 --> 02:22:59.540
<v Speaker 18>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>

2909
02:22:59.541 --> 02:23:02.930
<v Speaker 18>I would say heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I guess I still am a heroin addict.</v>

2910
02:23:03.450 --> 02:23:05.190
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>man,</v>

2911
02:23:05.210 --> 02:23:07.490
<v Speaker 18>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 18>not much to say about that.</v>

2912
02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2913
02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:12.360
<v Speaker 3>and are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in full recovery or I guess it's,</v>

2914
02:23:12.361 --> 02:23:14.860
<v Speaker 3>it's a lifelong struggle I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2915
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.710
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Uh,</v>

2916
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:16.670
<v Speaker 18>almost two years.</v>

2917
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2918
02:23:18.121 --> 02:23:18.954
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing that you wanted to talk </v>

2919
02:23:19.681 --> 02:23:20.514
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course is related to all this </v>

2920
02:23:21.301 --> 02:23:24.960
<v Speaker 3>is the war on drugs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something we talk about a lot in</v>

2921
02:23:24.961 --> 02:23:26.590
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2922
02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:27.473
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that familiar with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the drug situation in Canada in </v>

2923
02:23:30.601 --> 02:23:32.310
<v Speaker 3>general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you tell me a bit?</v>

2924
02:23:33.220 --> 02:23:37.360
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I probably don't follow politics as much</v>

2925
02:23:37.361 --> 02:23:38.380
<v Speaker 18>as they should.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I get,</v>

2926
02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:40.990
<v Speaker 18>I get too depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but uh,</v>

2927
02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:46.020
<v Speaker 18>I have read a lot of bruce alexander's </v>
<v Speaker 18>work and vancouver,</v>

2928
02:23:46.391 --> 02:23:51.280
<v Speaker 18>which is where I'm from originally.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I has the worst addiction problem in the</v>

2929
02:23:51.281 --> 02:23:52.114
<v Speaker 18>world pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 18>So he talks a lot about how </v>

2930
02:23:54.671 --> 02:23:55.504
<v Speaker 18>globalization has affected that and the </v>
<v Speaker 18>war on drugs pretty much focuses on the </v>

2931
02:24:01.241 --> 02:24:06.241
<v Speaker 18>drugs themselves as being evil.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And it's really not about the drugs.</v>

2932
02:24:07.090 --> 02:24:10.510
<v Speaker 18>I'm bruce alexander's work in the </v>
<v Speaker 18>seventies.</v>

2933
02:24:10.511 --> 02:24:15.511
<v Speaker 18>He pretty much disproved all other </v>
<v Speaker 18>notions of addiction,</v>

2934
02:24:17.380 --> 02:24:22.380
<v Speaker 18>but people are still held onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Basically it was called rat park.</v>

2935
02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:24.453
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>he gave some rats morphine water and of </v>

2936
02:24:29.711 --> 02:24:33.970
<v Speaker 18>course they used it up,</v>
<v Speaker 18>which is pretty much identical almost to</v>

2937
02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:34.853
<v Speaker 18>heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but then he puts another group of rats </v>

2938
02:24:37.810 --> 02:24:38.643
<v Speaker 18>in like a bigger container where they </v>
<v Speaker 18>could socialize and they could play and </v>

2939
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:46.383
<v Speaker 18>they had lots of room and those racks </v>
<v Speaker 18>wouldn't drink the morphine water even </v>

2940
02:24:51.491 --> 02:24:55.000
<v Speaker 18>when they had already forced them into </v>
<v Speaker 18>physical dependency.</v>

2941
02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:56.593
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>so that to me is evidence against this </v>

2942
02:25:00.701 --> 02:25:05.590
<v Speaker 18>whole crazy notion that we should be </v>
<v Speaker 18>fighting drugs.</v>

2943
02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:09.820
<v Speaker 18>Canada is in probably in the same state </v>
<v Speaker 18>as America,</v>

2944
02:25:09.821 --> 02:25:11.470
<v Speaker 18>but we are certainly getting there.</v>

2945
02:25:11.950 --> 02:25:12.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you guys do have some places with </v>

2946
02:25:14.581 --> 02:25:15.610
<v Speaker 3>vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2947
02:25:15.611 --> 02:25:17.320
<v Speaker 3>where at least marijuana is legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2948
02:25:18.510 --> 02:25:20.300
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>it's not legal.</v>

2949
02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:21.690
<v Speaker 18>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>

2950
02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:24.870
<v Speaker 18>we do have the safe sites,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but uh,</v>

2951
02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:26.273
<v Speaker 18>our conservative government or previous </v>
<v Speaker 18>conservative government tried really </v>

2952
02:25:29.501 --> 02:25:33.660
<v Speaker 18>hard to get rid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Um hmm.</v>

2953
02:25:34.450 --> 02:25:35.201
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

2955
02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:39.550
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating to me because you took </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a theme,</v>

2956
02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:41.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>related to,</v>

2957
02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:42.783
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>political correctness and this </v>

2958
02:25:44.281 --> 02:25:45.114
<v Speaker 3>depression stuff and all that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>applied it to something that we haven't </v>

2959
02:25:47.021 --> 02:25:47.854
<v Speaker 3>talked about that much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I really appreciate your thoughts on </v>

2960
02:25:49.091 --> 02:25:49.751
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2961
02:25:49.751 --> 02:25:52.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm on with john.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marco in Switzerland.</v>

2962
02:25:52.330 --> 02:25:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Has it going on in Switzerland right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

2963
02:25:54.610 --> 02:25:55.990
<v Speaker 19>Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 19>eight a.</v>

<v Speaker 19>It's evening and yeah,</v>

2965
02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:01.450
<v Speaker 19>I just waiting for your call here.</v>

2966
02:26:01.650 --> 02:26:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a guy with better hair than me.</v>

2967
02:26:03.721 --> 02:26:04.554
<v Speaker 3>This is very upsetting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're gonna we're gonna do it </v>

2968
02:26:07.741 --> 02:26:08.431
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2969
02:26:08.431 --> 02:26:09.264
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things you wanted to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about was sort of coming out as an </v>

2970
02:26:12.511 --> 02:26:13.344
<v Speaker 3>atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is really interesting and </v>

2971
02:26:15.031 --> 02:26:18.300
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things we've talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about here that people feel this need to</v>

2972
02:26:18.330 --> 02:26:19.163
<v Speaker 3>make this proclamation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So can you tell me a little bit about </v>

2973
02:26:21.211 --> 02:26:22.044
<v Speaker 3>your journey?</v>

2974
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:23.031
<v Speaker 19>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 19>yeah,</v>

2975
02:26:23.031 --> 02:26:24.680
<v Speaker 19>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Um,</v>

2976
02:26:24.860 --> 02:26:29.600
<v Speaker 19>well I was born and raised in </v>
<v Speaker 19>Switzerland,</v>

2977
02:26:30.020 --> 02:26:34.670
<v Speaker 19>so it's not a religious country,</v>
<v Speaker 19>it's just like,</v>

2978
02:26:34.671 --> 02:26:35.870
<v Speaker 19>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Um,</v>

2979
02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:39.120
<v Speaker 19>I had some,</v>
<v Speaker 19>some religion classes in,</v>

2980
02:26:39.130 --> 02:26:42.890
<v Speaker 19>in primary and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but I wasn't ever really religious.</v>

2981
02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:45.440
<v Speaker 19>I'm catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Was a catholic classes?</v>

2982
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:47.900
<v Speaker 19>No,</v>
<v Speaker 19>it was evangelical.</v>

2983
02:26:48.050 --> 02:26:50.340
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And um,</v>

2984
02:26:51.290 --> 02:26:52.123
<v Speaker 19>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>then I went to sydney for exchange </v>

2985
02:26:55.011 --> 02:26:56.710
<v Speaker 19>semester,</v>
<v Speaker 19>um,</v>

2986
02:26:57.230 --> 02:26:59.600
<v Speaker 19>when I was like 18,</v>
<v Speaker 19>19,</v>

2987
02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:03.530
<v Speaker 19>and I stumbled upon this,</v>
<v Speaker 19>this,</v>

2988
02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:07.550
<v Speaker 19>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 19>debates have ken hamm against,</v>

2989
02:27:08.530 --> 02:27:11.200
<v Speaker 19>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 19>um,</v>

2990
02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:11.871
<v Speaker 19>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So,</v>

2991
02:27:11.871 --> 02:27:16.871
<v Speaker 19>and I would like to say the least.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I thought it was ridiculous that,</v>

2992
02:27:17.171 --> 02:27:20.770
<v Speaker 19>that some people would think that weight</v>
<v Speaker 19>like ken hemi was.</v>

2993
02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:23.250
<v Speaker 3>So basically for people that don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the,</v>

2994
02:27:23.310 --> 02:27:24.143
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy that runs the board at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biblical park somewhere in America and </v>

2995
02:27:28.831 --> 02:27:32.760
<v Speaker 3>he debated bill nye about evolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus creation.</v>

2996
02:27:32.761 --> 02:27:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2997
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.090
<v Speaker 19>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>exactly.</v>

2998
02:27:34.290 --> 02:27:38.580
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So I was like a bit confused and,</v>

2999
02:27:38.581 --> 02:27:40.570
<v Speaker 19>and,</v>
<v Speaker 19>um,</v>

3000
02:27:40.780 --> 02:27:41.613
<v Speaker 19>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>told my brother and he was a little bit </v>

3001
02:27:43.151 --> 02:27:48.151
<v Speaker 19>more into that and then she showed me </v>
<v Speaker 19>christopher hitchens and richard dawkins</v>

3002
02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:53.180
<v Speaker 19>and I felt it would be good english </v>
<v Speaker 19>lesson to,</v>

3003
02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:56.650
<v Speaker 19>to read those books.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Like god is not great.</v>

3004
02:27:57.430 --> 02:28:00.130
<v Speaker 19>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 19>so yeah,</v>

3005
02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:02.553
<v Speaker 19>I felt that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I was talking to some people there </v>

3006
02:28:04.511 --> 02:28:05.344
<v Speaker 19>because I had connections to everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 19>in the world because like I had some </v>

3007
02:28:09.341 --> 02:28:11.440
<v Speaker 19>people from,</v>
<v Speaker 19>from sheila,</v>

3008
02:28:11.441 --> 02:28:13.300
<v Speaker 19>they're from Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 19>from Belgium,</v>

3009
02:28:13.301 --> 02:28:18.130
<v Speaker 19>from everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So what does donald me the most was this</v>

3010
02:28:18.131 --> 02:28:18.964
<v Speaker 19>guy from Switzerland actually who was </v>
<v Speaker 19>like while I believe in creationism and </v>

3011
02:28:26.270 --> 02:28:27.160
<v Speaker 19>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 19>just,</v>

3012
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:30.270
<v Speaker 19>it was a swiss guy like me.</v>
<v Speaker 19>What's,</v>

3013
02:28:30.370 --> 02:28:34.740
<v Speaker 19>what's thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 19>that like noah's ark really was just,</v>

3014
02:28:35.090 --> 02:28:37.970
<v Speaker 19>it was just mind blowing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Um,</v>

3015
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.863
<v Speaker 19>so I started to,</v>
<v Speaker 19>to watch debates on youtube and stuff </v>

3016
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:43.063
<v Speaker 19>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>when I came home I was like full blown </v>

3017
02:28:46.370 --> 02:28:47.203
<v Speaker 19>atheist.</v>

3018
02:28:49.180 --> 02:28:53.580
<v Speaker 3>It sounds to me that you deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what most atheists deal with,</v>

3019
02:28:53.581 --> 02:28:56.370
<v Speaker 3>which is that it's not actually that big</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a deal,</v>

3020
02:28:56.371 --> 02:28:57.204
<v Speaker 3>but you feel like you have to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>say it because otherwise the world just </v>

3021
02:29:01.231 --> 02:29:02.910
<v Speaker 3>thinks you believe something that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

3022
02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:04.310
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Right,</v>

3023
02:29:04.310 --> 02:29:05.650
<v Speaker 19>right.</v>
<v Speaker 19>It's like that.</v>

3024
02:29:05.980 --> 02:29:08.290
<v Speaker 19>And like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 19>when I discovered this,</v>

3025
02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:09.550
<v Speaker 19>all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I was,</v>

3026
02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:13.260
<v Speaker 19>I wasn't a little bit more militant.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I don't know how to say like,</v>

3027
02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:14.153
<v Speaker 19>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I thought people who believe this stuff </v>

3028
02:29:17.890 --> 02:29:18.723
<v Speaker 19>will be lazy or stupid or not really </v>
<v Speaker 19>stupid but like ignorant and kind of </v>

3029
02:29:23.531 --> 02:29:26.740
<v Speaker 19>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So I got a little bit out of that.</v>

3030
02:29:26.860 --> 02:29:29.350
<v Speaker 19>I let them have their beliefs and </v>
<v Speaker 19>whatever.</v>

3031
02:29:29.580 --> 02:29:30.690
<v Speaker 19>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

3032
02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:34.450
<v Speaker 19>But I need,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I feel need to tell that I don't believe</v>

3033
02:29:34.451 --> 02:29:35.284
<v Speaker 19>that.</v>

3034
02:29:37.170 --> 02:29:37.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3035
02:29:37.591 --> 02:29:40.680
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because I always say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what you believe as long as</v>

3036
02:29:40.681 --> 02:29:43.230
<v Speaker 3>you're not trying to chop my head off or</v>
<v Speaker 3>making me believe anything else,</v>

3037
02:29:43.231 --> 02:29:45.930
<v Speaker 3>then you go ahead and believe whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want,</v>

3038
02:29:45.931 --> 02:29:46.840
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um.</v>

3039
02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:48.193
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that you wrote in </v>

3040
02:29:49.261 --> 02:29:50.094
<v Speaker 3>that you want to talk about that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought was really interesting was that </v>

3041
02:29:52.081 --> 02:29:52.914
<v Speaker 3>you want to talk about the difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the us constitution and the </v>

3042
02:29:55.981 --> 02:29:59.610
<v Speaker 3>swiss constitution and that basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that we're a.</v>

3043
02:29:59.611 --> 02:30:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about the hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3044
02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:02.033
<v Speaker 3>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we are sort of obsessed with never </v>

3045
02:30:05.011 --> 02:30:05.844
<v Speaker 3>changing our constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you guys actually change your </v>

3046
02:30:08.341 --> 02:30:09.960
<v Speaker 3>constitution pretty frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3047
02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:12.230
<v Speaker 19>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>it was.</v>

3048
02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:13.073
<v Speaker 19>It wasn't like a debate about gun </v>
<v Speaker 19>regulation under the second amendment </v>

3049
02:30:18.060 --> 02:30:21.110
<v Speaker 19>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and I thought to myself lIke,</v>

3050
02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:23.093
<v Speaker 19>why wouldn't they allow to change that </v>
<v Speaker 19>like inside oldest lobbying and stuff </v>

3051
02:30:28.231 --> 02:30:29.064
<v Speaker 19>from the nra,</v>
<v Speaker 19>a gallup poll that like 55 percent of </v>

3052
02:30:34.301 --> 02:30:38.820
<v Speaker 19>the american people are for,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I'm more strict can regulation.</v>

3053
02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:44.630
<v Speaker 19>So I looked into it a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 19>and what I found was,</v>

3054
02:30:46.030 --> 02:30:49.950
<v Speaker 19>was pretty astonishing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I've always thought like,</v>

3055
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:52.830
<v Speaker 19>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 19>the american constitution is kinda,</v>

3056
02:30:52.831 --> 02:30:54.060
<v Speaker 19>it's kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 19>um,</v>

3057
02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:55.613
<v Speaker 19>static and,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and just for 230 years it was almost a </v>

3058
02:31:01.411 --> 02:31:05.490
<v Speaker 19>safe and swiss constitution as you may </v>
<v Speaker 19>know,</v>

3059
02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:06.473
<v Speaker 19>we have referendums like four times a </v>
<v Speaker 19>year where people just sending some </v>

3060
02:31:10.801 --> 02:31:11.634
<v Speaker 19>ideas and we vote on it.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And thiS is like changing the </v>

3061
02:31:15.451 --> 02:31:16.860
<v Speaker 19>constitution every time.</v>

3062
02:31:17.020 --> 02:31:17.853
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you say you guys do that four times </v>

3063
02:31:18.821 --> 02:31:19.654
<v Speaker 3>a year?</v>

3064
02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:20.670
<v Speaker 19>Yeah,</v>

3065
02:31:20.670 --> 02:31:21.540
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot.</v>

3066
02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:22.463
<v Speaker 3>And people show up and vote four times a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year and actually change the </v>

3067
02:31:25.141 --> 02:31:26.430
<v Speaker 3>constitution that often.</v>

3068
02:31:27.050 --> 02:31:27.571
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Yeah,</v>

3069
02:31:27.571 --> 02:31:28.900
<v Speaker 19>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Well,</v>

3070
02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:33.870
<v Speaker 19>we had like 50,</v>
<v Speaker 19>55 percent of the people at both.</v>

3071
02:31:34.510 --> 02:31:36.450
<v Speaker 19>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 19>the rest is just like,</v>

3072
02:31:36.451 --> 02:31:38.310
<v Speaker 19>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well do whatever you want.</v>

3073
02:31:40.030 --> 02:31:41.220
<v Speaker 19>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 19>yeah,</v>

3074
02:31:41.221 --> 02:31:42.054
<v Speaker 19>but we won't like for 12 or 12 to 15 </v>
<v Speaker 19>different referendum each year in force </v>

3075
02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:51.860
<v Speaker 19>steps.</v>

3076
02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:52.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

3077
02:31:52.431 --> 02:31:53.264
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So have you seen any gimme gimme like </v>

3078
02:31:54.770 --> 02:31:55.603
<v Speaker 3>one good example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like something that you guys have </v>

3079
02:31:57.141 --> 02:32:00.050
<v Speaker 3>changed for the better and one time that</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it didn't work if you can think of</v>

3080
02:32:00.051 --> 02:32:00.884
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>

3081
02:32:01.340 --> 02:32:02.173
<v Speaker 19>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>sure.</v>

3082
02:32:03.970 --> 02:32:07.970
<v Speaker 19>TwO thousand and 10.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I think it was um,</v>

3083
02:32:08.310 --> 02:32:11.510
<v Speaker 19>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 19>the far right party of Switzerland,</v>

3084
02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:16.520
<v Speaker 19>the svp proposed that we should ban </v>
<v Speaker 19>minarets,</v>

3085
02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:21.440
<v Speaker 19>like the towers on the mosques of the.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

3086
02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:24.750
<v Speaker 19>So,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and it was accepted by the people.</v>

3087
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:26.063
<v Speaker 19>So now we have in our constitution our </v>
<v Speaker 19>article like 72 that it's prohibited to </v>

3088
02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:38.600
<v Speaker 19>build minerals like when we have like </v>
<v Speaker 19>two little ends.</v>

3089
02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:41.130
<v Speaker 19>So it was like no issue at all.</v>

3090
02:32:41.170 --> 02:32:42.003
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't really a problem but the </v>

3091
02:32:42.901 --> 02:32:44.040
<v Speaker 3>far right grabbed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3092
02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:45.980
<v Speaker 19>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>it was just like sinophobia,</v>

3093
02:32:46.860 --> 02:32:48.350
<v Speaker 19>populistic and.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

3094
02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:54.140
<v Speaker 19>And the good thing we accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I really need to finish,</v>

3095
02:32:56.530 --> 02:33:01.530
<v Speaker 19>but it's like most things are good that </v>
<v Speaker 19>they're not accepted,</v>

3096
02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:04.770
<v Speaker 19>that we have some,</v>
<v Speaker 19>some,</v>

3097
02:33:05.430 --> 02:33:10.430
<v Speaker 19>like all these proposals are,</v>
<v Speaker 19>are either far right or far left like a.</v>

3098
02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:12.473
<v Speaker 19>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>like minimum wages and I mean that's </v>

3099
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.823
<v Speaker 19>kind of okay.</v>
<v Speaker 19>But minimum wages were like set to $22 </v>

3100
02:33:20.850 --> 02:33:24.300
<v Speaker 19>per hour and that's just ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 19>high.</v>

3101
02:33:24.390 --> 02:33:25.800
<v Speaker 19>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 19>who would pay that?</v>

3102
02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:26.793
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So does that ultimately hurt the swiss </v>

3103
02:33:28.571 --> 02:33:29.404
<v Speaker 3>economy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the businesses then leave </v>

3104
02:33:30.341 --> 02:33:31.174
<v Speaker 3>Switzerland because it sounds like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Switzerland and we always think of it </v>

3105
02:33:32.501 --> 02:33:32.741
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3106
02:33:32.741 --> 02:33:34.450
<v Speaker 3>they have so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's so happy.</v>

3107
02:33:34.451 --> 02:33:35.284
<v Speaker 3>It's so great.</v>

3108
02:33:36.210 --> 02:33:36.631
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 19>No,</v>

3109
02:33:36.631 --> 02:33:37.441
<v Speaker 19>I,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I think so.</v>

3110
02:33:37.441 --> 02:33:38.280
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 19>what I'm,</v>

3111
02:33:38.281 --> 02:33:39.114
<v Speaker 19>I'm not an economist,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but from what I've heard and what I've </v>

3112
02:33:42.871 --> 02:33:43.704
<v Speaker 19>read,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I think it will really hurt the country </v>

3113
02:33:46.561 --> 02:33:47.230
<v Speaker 19>as,</v>
<v Speaker 19>as a,</v>

3114
02:33:47.230 --> 02:33:51.290
<v Speaker 19>as a financial spot and,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and yeah.</v>

3115
02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:53.130
<v Speaker 19>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 19>yeah.</v>

3116
02:33:53.650 --> 02:33:55.330
<v Speaker 3>So the other thIng that you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about,</v>

3117
02:33:55.331 --> 02:33:58.060
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the things that almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone in europe,</v>

3118
02:33:58.061 --> 02:33:58.894
<v Speaker 3>especially his wanted to talk to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>about is the refugee situation and </v>

3119
02:34:02.411 --> 02:34:04.320
<v Speaker 3>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3120
02:34:04.330 --> 02:34:05.350
<v Speaker 3>so I'll let you go from there.</v>

3121
02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:08.250
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So um,</v>

3122
02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:10.410
<v Speaker 19>refugee crisis in,</v>
<v Speaker 19>in,</v>

3123
02:34:10.411 --> 02:34:15.411
<v Speaker 19>in Switzerland itself.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I mean I'm not that I'm on top of like,</v>

3124
02:34:16.310 --> 02:34:20.900
<v Speaker 19>like the whole situation.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I know where you stand on the balcony</v>

3125
02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:22.320
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry.</v>

3126
02:34:22.321 --> 02:34:23.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to quiz you on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just,</v>

3127
02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:24.750
<v Speaker 3>we're just getting your opinion.</v>

3128
02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:26.253
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>

3129
02:34:26.330 --> 02:34:26.971
<v Speaker 19>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I'm,</v>

3130
02:34:26.971 --> 02:34:31.971
<v Speaker 19>I'm basically for a like letting </v>
<v Speaker 19>refugees in like,</v>

3131
02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:34.250
<v Speaker 19>I mean we're all humans.</v>
<v Speaker 19>We should,</v>

3132
02:34:34.310 --> 02:34:37.370
<v Speaker 19>we should get along with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 19>help each other.</v>

3133
02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:41.870
<v Speaker 19>That's like human humanitarian aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 19>it.</v>

3134
02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:46.430
<v Speaker 19>But like the left is,</v>
<v Speaker 19>is pushing like these,</v>

3135
02:34:46.431 --> 02:34:51.431
<v Speaker 19>these ideas or these reasons to let them</v>
<v Speaker 19>in a like for example,</v>

3136
02:34:52.821 --> 02:34:57.440
<v Speaker 19>when when someone says just like </v>
<v Speaker 19>something a little bit,</v>

3137
02:34:58.430 --> 02:35:03.430
<v Speaker 19>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>let's say a controversial about refugees</v>

3138
02:35:04.731 --> 02:35:05.150
<v Speaker 19>and,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and,</v>

3139
02:35:05.150 --> 02:35:07.850
<v Speaker 19>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and what they're doing.</v>

3140
02:35:08.420 --> 02:35:13.420
<v Speaker 19>It's just like it Down and then you </v>
<v Speaker 19>cannot talk probably about,</v>

3141
02:35:15.471 --> 02:35:19.280
<v Speaker 19>about what the issue is with the </v>
<v Speaker 19>refugees that come in.</v>

3142
02:35:19.550 --> 02:35:20.383
<v Speaker 19>I mean I'm all for letting them in but </v>
<v Speaker 19>we have to talk about the issues that </v>

3143
02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:28.980
<v Speaker 19>are coming through us with this and </v>
<v Speaker 19>yeah,</v>

3144
02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.920
<v Speaker 19>they're just saying that or.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Yeah,</v>

3145
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.983
<v Speaker 19>saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 19>there are no problems at all with this </v>

3146
02:35:35.721 --> 02:35:40.721
<v Speaker 19>or like maybe a little bit financial but</v>
<v Speaker 19>nothing really cultural or.</v>

3147
02:35:41.450 --> 02:35:42.283
<v Speaker 19>Yeah,</v>

3148
02:35:42.690 --> 02:35:43.523
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly why I'm talking about on </v>

3149
02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:46.980
<v Speaker 3>the show because we got to have these </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>

3150
02:35:47.250 --> 02:35:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3157
02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:02.313
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've mentioned a lot about Sweden and </v>

3158
02:36:03.121 --> 02:36:03.954
<v Speaker 3>just recently I had a tino sign and </v>
<v Speaker 3>dodgy on the show who's an economist </v>

3159
02:36:08.251 --> 02:36:09.084
<v Speaker 3>from Sweden and one of the few people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that will talk about the political </v>

3160
02:36:12.061 --> 02:36:12.894
<v Speaker 3>correct situation and sort of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>regressive ideology that seems to have </v>

3161
02:36:16.411 --> 02:36:17.244
<v Speaker 3>taken hold in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got a Lot of messages from Sweden </v>

3162
02:36:19.801 --> 02:36:21.530
<v Speaker 3>talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3163
02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:24.750
<v Speaker 3>and you were the one we went with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we expect you to represent your,</v>

3164
02:36:24.810 --> 02:36:25.680
<v Speaker 3>your whole country.</v>

3165
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:27.910
<v Speaker 20>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Oh boy.</v>

3166
02:36:27.911 --> 02:36:28.744
<v Speaker 20>I'm the most honest swedish.</v>
<v Speaker 20>We could find a good representation </v>

3167
02:36:32.081 --> 02:36:32.914
<v Speaker 20>there.</v>

3168
02:36:33.210 --> 02:36:33.901
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

3169
02:36:33.901 --> 02:36:35.580
<v Speaker 3>I believe that it's about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>

3170
02:36:35.581 --> 02:36:37.450
<v Speaker 3>not about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bigger group.</v>

3171
02:36:37.451 --> 02:36:38.284
<v Speaker 3>So let's start with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things you wanted to talk </v>

3172
02:36:40.081 --> 02:36:40.914
<v Speaker 3>about was that the political correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this seeping ideology and what it's </v>

3173
02:36:45.661 --> 02:36:48.060
<v Speaker 3>doing to society in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's start with that.</v>

3174
02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:50.990
<v Speaker 20>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 20>uh,</v>

3175
02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:55.420
<v Speaker 20>I've been doing explain this because </v>
<v Speaker 20>it's,</v>

3176
02:36:55.421 --> 02:36:56.254
<v Speaker 20>it's fairly hard really,</v>
<v Speaker 20>since you need so much context for it </v>

3177
02:36:59.450 --> 02:37:01.010
<v Speaker 20>and we have so little time for it.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Yes,</v>

3178
02:37:02.810 --> 02:37:04.040
<v Speaker 3>we'll do the best you can.</v>

3179
02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:08.140
<v Speaker 20>I'll just save it.</v>
<v Speaker 20>It goes back at least a hundred years.</v>

3180
02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:13.810
<v Speaker 20>Started with the socialism and </v>
<v Speaker 20>everything like that in Sweden.</v>

3181
02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:17.900
<v Speaker 20>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 20>but in the modern era at least since the</v>

3182
02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:18.890
<v Speaker 20>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Um,</v>

3183
02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:24.220
<v Speaker 20>Sweden was a hotbed for very radical </v>
<v Speaker 20>leftism in the seventies.</v>

3184
02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:26.970
<v Speaker 20>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 20>we even had,</v>

3185
02:37:26.971 --> 02:37:27.804
<v Speaker 20>um,</v>
<v Speaker 20>left this terrorist and everything like </v>

3186
02:37:29.121 --> 02:37:34.121
<v Speaker 20>that in the Sweden that occupied and the</v>
<v Speaker 20>east and the west german and Scott West,</v>

3187
02:37:35.931 --> 02:37:40.070
<v Speaker 20>german embassy.</v>
<v Speaker 20>And so it has a long tradition,</v>

3188
02:37:42.450 --> 02:37:45.150
<v Speaker 20>but the biggest things I actually want </v>
<v Speaker 20>to explain what this,</v>

3189
02:37:45.180 --> 02:37:46.013
<v Speaker 20>that explains how Sweden works today is </v>
<v Speaker 20>two terms and I think I've translated </v>

3190
02:37:51.121 --> 02:37:56.121
<v Speaker 20>them reasonably.</v>
<v Speaker 20>One is called the opinion corridor and I</v>

3191
02:37:56.221 --> 02:37:59.580
<v Speaker 20>think that's kind of self explanatory,</v>
<v Speaker 20>but I'll give an explanation that it's,</v>

3192
02:38:00.180 --> 02:38:02.850
<v Speaker 20>um,</v>
<v Speaker 20>that is in Sweden.</v>

3193
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.640
<v Speaker 20>There's a very narrow corridor of </v>
<v Speaker 20>opinions.</v>

3194
02:38:05.641 --> 02:38:07.770
<v Speaker 20>We're allowed to have it arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Well,</v>

3195
02:38:07.771 --> 02:38:09.390
<v Speaker 20>if you have only opinion outside of </v>
<v Speaker 20>that,</v>

3196
02:38:09.391 --> 02:38:10.570
<v Speaker 20>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 20>you're a nazi,</v>

3197
02:38:10.571 --> 02:38:12.020
<v Speaker 20>you're a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 20>you're big attend,</v>

3198
02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:13.440
<v Speaker 20>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 20>you're all of that</v>

3199
02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:17.540
<v Speaker 1>nazi or racist or bigoted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just get that out.</v>

3200
02:38:18.850 --> 02:38:23.200
<v Speaker 20>I'm neither of those.</v>
<v Speaker 20>I may be very arian,</v>

3201
02:38:23.201 --> 02:38:26.120
<v Speaker 20>but I'm not a nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 20>And,</v>

3202
02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:28.173
<v Speaker 20>and events opinion corridor for my </v>
<v Speaker 20>entire lifetime has just been narrowing </v>

3203
02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:33.913
<v Speaker 20>and,</v>
<v Speaker 20>and I would definitely say that it </v>

3204
02:38:35.411 --> 02:38:39.490
<v Speaker 20>narrowed its most when obama became a </v>
<v Speaker 20>president.</v>

3205
02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:41.390
<v Speaker 20>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 20>Yeah.</v>

3206
02:38:41.470 --> 02:38:46.470
<v Speaker 20>I would say in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 20>The last I'd say two decades I guess has</v>

3207
02:38:47.441 --> 02:38:49.900
<v Speaker 20>tried to emulate America and all its </v>
<v Speaker 20>worst parts.</v>

3208
02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:54.250
<v Speaker 20>And so we always had this opinion </v>
<v Speaker 20>corridor,</v>

3209
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:55.623
<v Speaker 20>but then we saw how you guys started </v>
<v Speaker 20>going with the political correctness </v>

3210
02:38:58.241 --> 02:39:02.650
<v Speaker 20>part and then it just went worse.</v>
<v Speaker 20>So,</v>

3211
02:39:03.730 --> 02:39:04.563
<v Speaker 21>and</v>

3212
02:39:05.740 --> 02:39:07.420
<v Speaker 20>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 20>I think that explains that part.</v>

3213
02:39:07.990 --> 02:39:11.740
<v Speaker 20>Then we also have another term that we </v>
<v Speaker 20>didn't advance,</v>

3214
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:12.663
<v Speaker 20>but a swedish political commentator in </v>
<v Speaker 20>the seventies put two coin very well is </v>

3215
02:39:17.470 --> 02:39:18.303
<v Speaker 20>called veal hellman move battery.</v>
<v Speaker 20>And I would recommend reading up about </v>

3216
02:39:21.011 --> 02:39:21.844
<v Speaker 20>him because he will give a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 20>contexts that are bullshit that's going </v>

3217
02:39:23.531 --> 02:39:25.090
<v Speaker 20>on today.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Um,</v>

3218
02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:28.420
<v Speaker 20>and I think I'll try to pronounce this </v>
<v Speaker 20>demo creatorship he called it,</v>

3219
02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:30.213
<v Speaker 20>um,</v>
<v Speaker 20>combination of the word democracy and </v>

3220
02:39:32.051 --> 02:39:32.884
<v Speaker 20>dictatorship right now that works </v>
<v Speaker 20>essentially in that we have a formal </v>

3221
02:39:38.141 --> 02:39:39.850
<v Speaker 20>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 20>um,</v>

3222
02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:41.103
<v Speaker 20>but on the best of the,</v>
<v Speaker 20>of the cultural force that our </v>

3223
02:39:44.081 --> 02:39:46.330
<v Speaker 20>government represents,</v>
<v Speaker 20>um,</v>

3224
02:39:46.660 --> 02:39:47.493
<v Speaker 20>we haven't enforced dictatorship of </v>
<v Speaker 20>sorts in the form of the cultural on </v>

3225
02:39:51.631 --> 02:39:52.464
<v Speaker 20>the,</v>
<v Speaker 20>in Sweden that know has its expression </v>

3226
02:39:55.001 --> 02:39:57.270
<v Speaker 20>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 20>uh,</v>

3227
02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:58.390
<v Speaker 20>in the opinion corridor,</v>

3228
02:39:59.020 --> 02:39:59.853
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're talking about basically </v>

3229
02:40:00.671 --> 02:40:02.380
<v Speaker 1>is as we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've used this phrase,</v>

3230
02:40:02.381 --> 02:40:05.290
<v Speaker 1>the oppression olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are really big on this,</v>

3231
02:40:05.291 --> 02:40:06.124
<v Speaker 1>that depending on who you are and where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're from and your religion and your </v>

3232
02:40:09.311 --> 02:40:12.550
<v Speaker 1>skin color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really put you in this pecking order,</v>

3233
02:40:12.551 --> 02:40:13.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3234
02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:13.900
<v Speaker 20>Absolutely.</v>

3235
02:40:13.900 --> 02:40:15.930
<v Speaker 1>And you were baSically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were very much a home,</v>

3236
02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:19.510
<v Speaker 1>a home homogenous society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now that's really changing,</v>

3237
02:40:19.511 --> 02:40:21.350
<v Speaker 1>so the pecking order starts getting you </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

3238
02:40:21.490 --> 02:40:24.910
<v Speaker 20>We were a very homogenous society on </v>
<v Speaker 20>film until at least the nineties.</v>

3239
02:40:26.050 --> 02:40:29.920
<v Speaker 20>That's when the balkan wars erupted on </v>
<v Speaker 20>the other genocide.</v>

3240
02:40:29.921 --> 02:40:31.810
<v Speaker 20>And I'm doing that and we got a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 20>refugees from that.</v>

3241
02:40:32.290 --> 02:40:33.970
<v Speaker 20>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 20>they've Integrated mostly.</v>

3242
02:40:33.971 --> 02:40:34.804
<v Speaker 20>well,</v>
<v Speaker 20>we didn't really get the problems until </v>

3243
02:40:36.011 --> 02:40:40.780
<v Speaker 20>we have the very large immigration from </v>
<v Speaker 20>the middle east.</v>

3244
02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:42.033
<v Speaker 20>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 20>it's easier to integrate a european </v>

3245
02:40:42.911 --> 02:40:43.744
<v Speaker 20>culture than a completely foreign </v>
<v Speaker 20>culture from an entire different parts </v>

3246
02:40:46.091 --> 02:40:47.950
<v Speaker 20>of the world with different cultural </v>
<v Speaker 20>context and all of that.</v>

3247
02:40:48.690 --> 02:40:49.523
<v Speaker 20>Um,</v>

3248
02:40:50.290 --> 02:40:53.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sayinG that would label you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

3249
02:40:53.141 --> 02:40:54.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely right.</v>

3250
02:40:54.990 --> 02:40:59.990
<v Speaker 20>I'm definitely a racist for sayinG that.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Um,</v>

3251
02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:03.190
<v Speaker 20>so,</v>
<v Speaker 20>so the problem is because that's outside</v>

3252
02:41:03.191 --> 02:41:04.024
<v Speaker 20>of the opinion courtyard,</v>
<v Speaker 20>we can talk openly about it and that's </v>

3253
02:41:07.351 --> 02:41:09.830
<v Speaker 20>cost all a lot of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 20>And</v>

3254
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:10.990
<v Speaker 1>yEah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that leads,</v>

3255
02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:13.510
<v Speaker 1>that leads directly to the other thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want to talk about,</v>

3256
02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:15.330
<v Speaker 20>especially at.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Exactly.</v>

3257
02:41:15.331 --> 02:41:16.290
<v Speaker 20>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 20>yeah,</v>

3258
02:41:16.690 --> 02:41:18.250
<v Speaker 1>it leads to the other thing you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>

3259
02:41:18.251 --> 02:41:20.140
<v Speaker 1>which is the rise of the right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>

3260
02:41:20.141 --> 02:41:22.090
<v Speaker 1>which is a new phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you lay that out?</v>

3261
02:41:22.690 --> 02:41:23.700
<v Speaker 20>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 20>yeah,</v>

3262
02:41:23.701 --> 02:41:24.534
<v Speaker 20>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 20>it's a new phenomenon because in Sweden </v>

3263
02:41:26.010 --> 02:41:28.860
<v Speaker 20>the left has essentially ruled as post </v>
<v Speaker 20>world war two,</v>

3264
02:41:29.330 --> 02:41:30.163
<v Speaker 20>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 20>for 60 years we had one party dominant </v>

3265
02:41:32.941 --> 02:41:35.160
<v Speaker 20>in our,</v>
<v Speaker 20>what's it called?</v>

3266
02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:36.113
<v Speaker 20>And parliament for 60 years we had the </v>
<v Speaker 20>social democrats completely dominant in </v>

3267
02:41:40.231 --> 02:41:41.520
<v Speaker 20>the parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Uh,</v>

3268
02:41:42.060 --> 02:41:44.220
<v Speaker 20>only one the interruption for four </v>
<v Speaker 20>years.</v>

3269
02:41:46.610 --> 02:41:47.443
<v Speaker 20>And that's kind of when I look about it,</v>
<v Speaker 20>I'm a student of history so I can see </v>

3270
02:41:51.491 --> 02:41:53.310
<v Speaker 20>the negative side of it is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 20>insane.</v>

3271
02:41:53.311 --> 02:41:58.311
<v Speaker 20>Does he just have one party that they </v>
<v Speaker 20>did achieve some pretty good things.</v>

3272
02:41:58.501 --> 02:42:01.020
<v Speaker 20>The things we called full kemeten to </v>
<v Speaker 20>Sweden or welfare states,</v>

3273
02:42:01.050 --> 02:42:05.070
<v Speaker 20>they did achieve that,</v>
<v Speaker 20>but they also dismantled it and so,</v>

3274
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.823
<v Speaker 20>but the right has risen because we can't</v>
<v Speaker 20>speak about these things and they are </v>

3275
02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:12.670
<v Speaker 20>the only ones that had the balls to </v>
<v Speaker 20>speak about it because,</v>

3276
02:42:13.290 --> 02:42:16.140
<v Speaker 20>well,</v>
<v Speaker 20>the extreme part world or the nazis,</v>

3277
02:42:17.130 --> 02:42:17.963
<v Speaker 20>the less extreme but didn't really care </v>
<v Speaker 20>to be compared that they were compared </v>

3278
02:42:20.551 --> 02:42:22.830
<v Speaker 20>with the nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 20>So they just talked about it.</v>

3279
02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:24.353
<v Speaker 20>And now the only way to talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 20>is to dedicate yourself to being on the </v>

3280
02:42:28.351 --> 02:42:29.640
<v Speaker 20>far right,</v>
<v Speaker 20>essentIally.</v>

3281
02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:30.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we see this happening in America </v>

3282
02:42:32.271 --> 02:42:33.104
<v Speaker 1>right now and that's why I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it because I see all of </v>

3283
02:42:35.391 --> 02:42:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just in Sweden but all over europe.</v>

3284
02:42:37.401 --> 02:42:41.150
<v Speaker 1>I see this happening and I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help that not happen here.</v>

3285
02:42:41.450 --> 02:42:42.283
<v Speaker 1>So what does that do for a person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a person that is not a </v>

3286
02:42:45.051 --> 02:42:45.884
<v Speaker 1>nazi and is not a racist and yet you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem with society and only one </v>

3287
02:42:49.311 --> 02:42:50.570
<v Speaker 1>group talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does,</v>

3288
02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:51.740
<v Speaker 1>where does that leave you?</v>

3289
02:42:52.580 --> 02:42:54.380
<v Speaker 20>Completely alone,</v>
<v Speaker 20>essentIally.</v>

3290
02:42:54.850 --> 02:42:56.900
<v Speaker 20>um,</v>
<v Speaker 20>because the left.</v>

3291
02:42:56.930 --> 02:42:59.230
<v Speaker 20>Well they think I'm the great satan </v>
<v Speaker 20>there.</v>

3292
02:42:59.250 --> 02:43:00.083
<v Speaker 20>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 20>Well I'm also the great satan for them </v>

3293
02:43:01.671 --> 02:43:02.840
<v Speaker 20>because,</v>
<v Speaker 20>well,</v>

3294
02:43:02.841 --> 02:43:03.674
<v Speaker 20>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 20>I kind of think that brown people or </v>

3295
02:43:05.241 --> 02:43:06.074
<v Speaker 20>people to and jobs are done like people </v>
<v Speaker 20>and that's not right according to the </v>

3296
02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:11.050
<v Speaker 20>four,</v>
<v Speaker 20>right?</v>

3297
02:43:11.050 --> 02:43:11.883
<v Speaker 20>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 20>I mean I consider myself an ideological </v>

3298
02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:17.673
<v Speaker 20>ideologically independent because I </v>
<v Speaker 20>consider ideologies to be secular </v>

3299
02:43:20.321 --> 02:43:21.990
<v Speaker 20>religions.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Um,</v>

3300
02:43:22.510 --> 02:43:24.910
<v Speaker 20>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 20>I shy away from those things.</v>

3301
02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:28.950
<v Speaker 20>So it's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 20>And being of my camp in Sweden,</v>

3302
02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:29.620
<v Speaker 20>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 20>you know,</v>

3303
02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:30.500
<v Speaker 20>liberal essentially,</v>

3304
02:43:31.850 --> 02:43:32.683
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole purpose of this show </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I almost everyone that I'm talking </v>

3305
02:43:34.651 --> 02:43:37.350
<v Speaker 3>today talking with today over all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

3306
02:43:37.490 --> 02:43:40.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just to end this real quick though,</v>

3307
02:43:40.051 --> 02:43:40.884
<v Speaker 3>because we got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're starting your own youtube </v>

3308
02:43:42.061 --> 02:43:42.511
<v Speaker 3>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3309
02:43:42.511 --> 02:43:44.700
<v Speaker 3>To get these ideas across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where can we send people?</v>

3310
02:43:45.130 --> 02:43:47.770
<v Speaker 20>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 20>the youtube channel has been slow.</v>

3311
02:43:47.771 --> 02:43:49.720
<v Speaker 20>I ended up taking because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 20>busy.</v>

3312
02:43:49.810 --> 02:43:52.140
<v Speaker 20>I'm a college student so.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Um,</v>

3313
02:43:52.270 --> 02:43:55.930
<v Speaker 20>but look for the thought criminals </v>
<v Speaker 20>channel in the near future.</v>

3314
02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on with michael in Colorado.</v>

3315
02:43:58.151 --> 02:43:59.020
<v Speaker 3>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you?</v>

02:44:01.490 --> 02:44:03.490
<v Speaker 3>good to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have to tell you,</v>

3319
02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:08.050
<v Speaker 3>we picked 20 people at a 1200 and I hope</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take thIs the right way.</v>

3320
02:44:08.051 --> 02:44:09.910
<v Speaker 3>You are the elder statesmen of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>

3321
02:44:10.450 --> 02:44:13.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to add any extra pressure.</v>

3322
02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that'll give me a beer at the local</v>

3323
02:44:15.731 --> 02:44:16.564
<v Speaker 3>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's good.</v>

3324
02:44:17.050 --> 02:44:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first off,</v>

3325
02:44:18.851 --> 02:44:19.684
<v Speaker 3>you had a really interesting history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why I wanted </v>

3326
02:44:22.871 --> 02:44:23.820
<v Speaker 3>to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3327
02:44:23.890 --> 02:44:25.870
<v Speaker 3>and you were in the navy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so first off,</v>

3328
02:44:25.871 --> 02:44:27.880
<v Speaker 3>tell me when you served,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you served.</v>

3329
02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:30.200
<v Speaker 22>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 22>I was in the navy.</v>

3330
02:44:30.201 --> 02:44:32.600
<v Speaker 22>I joined and when I was 18 out of high </v>
<v Speaker 22>school,</v>

3331
02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:33.651
<v Speaker 22>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 22>went in,</v>

3332
02:44:33.651 --> 02:44:35.590
<v Speaker 22>in 1961.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Uh,</v>

3333
02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:37.340
<v Speaker 22>put that in context.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Let's see.</v>

3334
02:44:37.341 --> 02:44:39.770
<v Speaker 22>President kennedy announced the apollo </v>
<v Speaker 22>program.</v>

3335
02:44:40.330 --> 02:44:44.000
<v Speaker 22>A west side story came out and our </v>
<v Speaker 22>president,</v>

3336
02:44:44.001 --> 02:44:46.490
<v Speaker 22>barack obama was born when he was in </v>
<v Speaker 22>diapers.</v>

3337
02:44:46.491 --> 02:44:49.940
<v Speaker 22>I was in bootcamp and I served eight </v>
<v Speaker 22>years,</v>

3338
02:44:50.870 --> 02:44:53.620
<v Speaker 22>got out In 1969 to go to college.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Uh,</v>

3339
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:54.583
<v Speaker 22>san diego.</v>
<v Speaker 22>I was on a guided missile destroyer of </v>

3340
02:44:57.230 --> 02:44:59.390
<v Speaker 22>all over the pacific for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 22>came back,</v>

3341
02:44:59.391 --> 02:45:04.391
<v Speaker 22>got involved and the polaris submarine </v>
<v Speaker 22>program and I was stationed in Spain for</v>

3342
02:45:05.001 --> 02:45:05.834
<v Speaker 22>a couple years and then at charleston </v>
<v Speaker 22>for a couple of years working on some </v>

3343
02:45:08.180 --> 02:45:09.090
<v Speaker 22>high tech,</v>
<v Speaker 22>you know,</v>

3344
02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:13.070
<v Speaker 22>secret stuff and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 22>said adios to that.</v>

3345
02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:15.740
<v Speaker 22>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 22>went to school on the gi bill,</v>

3346
02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:20.030
<v Speaker 22>took a degree in anthropology and pretty</v>
<v Speaker 22>much minored in history.</v>

3347
02:45:20.690 --> 02:45:23.060
<v Speaker 22>And then life going on.</v>

3348
02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:24.113
<v Speaker 3>Then life went on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look back at that part of your </v>

3349
02:45:26.041 --> 02:45:28.860
<v Speaker 3>life to serve as part of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think of it fondly?</v>

3350
02:45:28.861 --> 02:45:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3351
02:45:30.540 --> 02:45:32.250
<v Speaker 3>do you miss it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything like that?</v>

3352
02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:34.540
<v Speaker 22>I do think of it finally,</v>
<v Speaker 22>you know,</v>

3353
02:45:34.570 --> 02:45:35.520
<v Speaker 22>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 22>you know,</v>

3354
02:45:35.570 --> 02:45:39.060
<v Speaker 22>mate does make the mind grow a little </v>
<v Speaker 22>bit more accommodating I think.</v>

3355
02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:41.100
<v Speaker 22>But all,</v>
<v Speaker 22>it was really good for me.</v>

3356
02:45:41.101 --> 02:45:44.220
<v Speaker 22>How it had no idea what I wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 22>when I was 18 years old.</v>

3357
02:45:44.221 --> 02:45:46.200
<v Speaker 22>My friends,</v>
<v Speaker 22>many of them are going off to college,</v>

3358
02:45:46.201 --> 02:45:49.160
<v Speaker 22>but I knew I wasn't really ready for </v>
<v Speaker 22>that somehow.</v>

3359
02:45:49.350 --> 02:45:51.630
<v Speaker 22>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 22>it was good for me in a lot of ways.</v>

3360
02:45:51.750 --> 02:45:53.560
<v Speaker 22>It helped me to grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 22>uh,</v>

3361
02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:54.493
<v Speaker 22>gave me some responsibility now that I </v>
<v Speaker 22>can handle that gave me the equivalent </v>

3362
02:45:58.861 --> 02:46:00.930
<v Speaker 22>of a masters degree in electrical </v>
<v Speaker 22>engineering,</v>

3363
02:46:01.410 --> 02:46:03.270
<v Speaker 22>which was a big help.</v>
<v Speaker 22>But,</v>

3364
02:46:03.290 --> 02:46:04.123
<v Speaker 22>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 22>when I got out I abandoned engineering </v>

3365
02:46:05.311 --> 02:46:06.144
<v Speaker 22>and went directly into anthropology </v>
<v Speaker 22>because eight years of engineering is </v>

3366
02:46:09.470 --> 02:46:10.250
<v Speaker 22>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 22>uh,</v>

3367
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:10.850
<v Speaker 22>is enough.</v>

3368
02:46:10.850 --> 02:46:11.683
<v Speaker 1>But I'm pretty sure if my notes serve me</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct that in 1964 before you went to </v>

3369
02:46:16.221 --> 02:46:17.870
<v Speaker 1>anthropologie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you built a computer.</v>

3370
02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:18.971
<v Speaker 22>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 22>uh,</v>

3371
02:46:18.971 --> 02:46:19.804
<v Speaker 22>Built and more,</v>
<v Speaker 22>more to the poInt I programmed my first </v>

3372
02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:28.130
<v Speaker 22>digital computer because when I got into</v>
<v Speaker 22>the polaris program that all the systems</v>

3373
02:46:28.771 --> 02:46:29.604
<v Speaker 22>on the boats,</v>
<v Speaker 22>these are intercontinental ballistic </v>

3374
02:46:30.781 --> 02:46:33.830
<v Speaker 22>missile systems are run by computers,</v>
<v Speaker 22>uh,</v>

3375
02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:35.760
<v Speaker 22>in 1964,</v>
<v Speaker 22>those computers,</v>

3376
02:46:35.761 --> 02:46:37.860
<v Speaker 22>we're probably not quite as powerful as </v>
<v Speaker 22>the iphone,</v>

3377
02:46:40.410 --> 02:46:43.440
<v Speaker 22>but I was very fascinated by computers </v>
<v Speaker 22>still still am.</v>

3378
02:46:43.530 --> 02:46:45.180
<v Speaker 22>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 22>and as part of my training,</v>

3379
02:46:45.181 --> 02:46:48.630
<v Speaker 22>we put together a little block system of</v>
<v Speaker 22>computers,</v>

3380
02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:52.740
<v Speaker 22>have a digital computer and learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 22>do the basic programming.</v>

3381
02:46:52.741 --> 02:46:54.450
<v Speaker 22>It was all what we call machine </v>
<v Speaker 22>language.</v>

3382
02:46:54.451 --> 02:46:55.284
<v Speaker 22>It was all ones and zeros.</v>
<v Speaker 22>And then we went to the lab and we </v>

3383
02:46:57.481 --> 02:46:59.680
<v Speaker 22>started programming where you're going </v>
<v Speaker 22>on the big guys.</v>

3384
02:46:59.790 --> 02:47:00.623
<v Speaker 22>Nineteen 64.</v>
<v Speaker 22>So that was my introduction to digital </v>

3385
02:47:02.820 --> 02:47:03.400
<v Speaker 22>computer.</v>

3386
02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's so cool.</v>

3387
02:47:04.421 --> 02:47:08.140
<v Speaker 1>So 1964,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working on the very beginnings of</v>

3388
02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:10.030
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of digital computers.</v>

3389
02:47:10.031 --> 02:47:10.471
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3390
02:47:10.471 --> 02:47:12.250
<v Speaker 1>the zeroes and ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever.</v>

3391
02:47:12.251 --> 02:47:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember ever having the glimpse </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what that could become?</v>

3392
02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:16.713
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever think you could be walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with this thing in your pocket </v>

3393
02:47:18.791 --> 02:47:19.624
<v Speaker 1>that would be exponentially more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful than everything you were </v>

3394
02:47:22.361 --> 02:47:23.260
<v Speaker 1>working on at the moment?</v>

3395
02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:24.553
<v Speaker 22>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 22>I don't think anybody did at the time </v>

3396
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:29.820
<v Speaker 22>because it was the beginning of solid </v>
<v Speaker 22>state to solid state years.</v>

3397
02:47:30.060 --> 02:47:31.820
<v Speaker 22>These things are really big.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Uh,</v>

3398
02:47:31.930 --> 02:47:32.890
<v Speaker 22>they,</v>
<v Speaker 22>they work,</v>

3399
02:47:33.060 --> 02:47:34.560
<v Speaker 22>they were in cabinets,</v>
<v Speaker 22>did,</v>

3400
02:47:35.190 --> 02:47:37.330
<v Speaker 22>was open to et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 22>uh,</v>

3401
02:47:37.350 --> 02:47:40.860
<v Speaker 22>I remember when the personal computer,</v>
<v Speaker 22>they all chair those dose came out,</v>

3402
02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:42.180
<v Speaker 22>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 22>it was pretty neat.</v>

3403
02:47:42.181 --> 02:47:45.210
<v Speaker 22>You can have one at home,</v>
<v Speaker 22>but hell,</v>

3404
02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:46.073
<v Speaker 22>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 22>digital or ellie lcd watches were the </v>

3405
02:47:48.601 --> 02:47:49.800
<v Speaker 22>big thing back then.</v>
<v Speaker 22>And,</v>

3406
02:47:49.870 --> 02:47:50.703
<v Speaker 22>and Texas instruments calculators.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Nobody really thought that we'd be able </v>

3407
02:47:54.631 --> 02:47:58.590
<v Speaker 22>to have an iphone and communicate face </v>
<v Speaker 22>to face dick tracy,</v>

3408
02:47:58.591 --> 02:48:00.840
<v Speaker 22>like things when I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 22>the copies we,</v>

3409
02:48:00.841 --> 02:48:02.520
<v Speaker 22>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 22>we thought that would be pretty cool,</v>

3410
02:48:02.521 --> 02:48:06.690
<v Speaker 22>but whoever thought that the,</v>
<v Speaker 22>the advances will be that fast.</v>

3411
02:48:06.850 --> 02:48:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember being at a friend's house.</v>

3412
02:48:09.050 --> 02:48:12.300
<v Speaker 1>He's probably when I was six on a Texas </v>
<v Speaker 1>instruments computer playing a.</v>

3413
02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:13.353
<v Speaker 1>They had their own version of pac man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like they're ripped off version </v>

3414
02:48:15.581 --> 02:48:17.560
<v Speaker 1>of pac man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was the coolest thing ever.</v>

3415
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.830
<v Speaker 22>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 22>yeah.</v>

3416
02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:20.113
<v Speaker 22>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 22>you know,</v>

3417
02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:21.193
<v Speaker 22>there was a book called future shock.</v>
<v Speaker 22>You're probably familiar with years ago </v>

3418
02:48:23.531 --> 02:48:24.364
<v Speaker 22>in which alvin toffler predicted at </v>
<v Speaker 22>progress would be so fast that by the </v>

3419
02:48:28.371 --> 02:48:30.740
<v Speaker 22>time you began to get a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 22>comfortable,</v>

3420
02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:31.813
<v Speaker 22>the next thing will come along and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 22>be a little bit in shock and you're </v>

3421
02:48:33.711 --> 02:48:35.090
<v Speaker 22>dealing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 22>The next thing will come to.</v>

3422
02:48:35.091 --> 02:48:35.924
<v Speaker 22>The next thing would come and I think </v>
<v Speaker 22>that's pretty much where we're at right </v>

3423
02:48:38.481 --> 02:48:38.740
<v Speaker 22>now.</v>

3424
02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:39.573
<v Speaker 1>It does seem like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the second we get okay with a </v>

3425
02:48:41.681 --> 02:48:42.514
<v Speaker 1>little bit of the technology or just </v>
<v Speaker 1>some another app comes out the second </v>

3426
02:48:45.971 --> 02:48:46.391
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3427
02:48:46.391 --> 02:48:49.160
<v Speaker 1>with one and then now this one does </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else and you forget that.</v>

3428
02:48:49.450 --> 02:48:50.860
<v Speaker 1>IT's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

3429
02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:52.450
<v Speaker 22>It is in the.</v>
<v Speaker 22>You know,</v>

3430
02:48:52.451 --> 02:48:55.000
<v Speaker 22>what I find kind of disheartening is a </v>
<v Speaker 22>lot of people.</v>

3431
02:48:55.001 --> 02:48:58.420
<v Speaker 22>One of the things I do here is I have on</v>
<v Speaker 22>the library board or if I helped some of</v>

3432
02:48:58.421 --> 02:48:59.254
<v Speaker 22>the older retirees here and try to deal </v>
<v Speaker 22>with their ipad and their iphones and </v>

3433
02:49:03.491 --> 02:49:04.630
<v Speaker 22>god help them,</v>
<v Speaker 22>their windows,</v>

3434
02:49:04.631 --> 02:49:05.710
<v Speaker 22>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 22>et cetera.</v>

3435
02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:08.130
<v Speaker 1>That must be a trial</v>

3436
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:09.750
<v Speaker 22>in patients.</v>
<v Speaker 22>It's tough.</v>

3437
02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:10.770
<v Speaker 22>Can you deal,</v>
<v Speaker 22>can I give you.</v>

3438
02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:12.990
<v Speaker 22>Can I give my mom your number?</v>
<v Speaker 22>You can.</v>

3439
02:49:13.230 --> 02:49:14.063
<v Speaker 22>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 22>good.</v>

3440
02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:16.520
<v Speaker 22>Not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Um,</v>

3441
02:49:17.310 --> 02:49:18.143
<v Speaker 22>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 22>I liked a lot of the older people are </v>

3442
02:49:19.561 --> 02:49:20.394
<v Speaker 22>now understanding that this is actually </v>
<v Speaker 22>a device that can be used for things </v>

3443
02:49:23.671 --> 02:49:24.504
<v Speaker 22>like we're doing here and for making </v>
<v Speaker 22>contact with other people and spreading </v>

3444
02:49:27.481 --> 02:49:32.160
<v Speaker 22>ideas and getting your ideas out so and </v>
<v Speaker 22>so you become easier to use.</v>

3445
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:34.080
<v Speaker 22>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 22>the human sense.</v>

3446
02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:36.570
<v Speaker 22>People are going to look past the </v>
<v Speaker 22>technology now.</v>

3447
02:49:36.571 --> 02:49:39.390
<v Speaker 22>I have a neighbor who's,</v>
<v Speaker 22>she's 20 years older than me.</v>

3448
02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:41.130
<v Speaker 22>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 22>So she's 93 years old.</v>

3449
02:49:41.490 --> 02:49:44.160
<v Speaker 22>She has an ipad,</v>
<v Speaker 22>she has her,</v>

3450
02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:48.660
<v Speaker 22>your email and little google things and </v>
<v Speaker 22>all of that with her ipad.</v>

3451
02:49:48.661 --> 02:49:52.740
<v Speaker 22>And she's quite quite familiar with it.</v>
<v Speaker 22>It's sort of magic to her,</v>

3452
02:49:52.741 --> 02:49:55.560
<v Speaker 22>but she knows how to use it so it puts </v>
<v Speaker 22>her in touch.</v>

3453
02:49:55.650 --> 02:49:57.090
<v Speaker 22>That's really.</v>
<v Speaker 22>That's pretty cool.</v>

3454
02:49:57.091 --> 02:49:57.924
<v Speaker 22>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Let's shift topics altogether because </v>

3455
02:49:59.041 --> 02:50:01.350
<v Speaker 22>you gave me a blind submission.</v>
<v Speaker 22>You,</v>

3456
02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:04.110
<v Speaker 22>you are an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Were you always an atheist?</v>

3457
02:50:04.111 --> 02:50:07.230
<v Speaker 22>When did you decide you are an atheist?</v>
<v Speaker 22>You were an atheist before.</v>

3458
02:50:07.231 --> 02:50:08.580
<v Speaker 22>It was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Now it's cool.</v>

3459
02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:09.701
<v Speaker 22>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Yeah.</v>

3460
02:50:09.701 --> 02:50:11.460
<v Speaker 22>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 22>it's a template that is still not cool.</v>

3461
02:50:11.461 --> 02:50:12.294
<v Speaker 22>I can point it to.</v>
<v Speaker 22>We have five churches and for real </v>

3462
02:50:15.721 --> 02:50:18.960
<v Speaker 22>estate offices in a town of 800.</v>
<v Speaker 22>So think about that for a bit.</v>

3463
02:50:19.020 --> 02:50:20.640
<v Speaker 22>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 22>you're a real minority.</v>

3464
02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:22.560
<v Speaker 22>You're a minority and a minority right </v>
<v Speaker 22>there.</v>

3465
02:50:22.910 --> 02:50:23.780
<v Speaker 22>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Yeah,</v>

3466
02:50:23.790 --> 02:50:25.030
<v Speaker 22>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Especially here.</v>

3467
02:50:26.370 --> 02:50:27.203
<v Speaker 22>I remember I was thinking about that and</v>
<v Speaker 22>I remember when I was probably five or </v>

3468
02:50:30.631 --> 02:50:31.464
<v Speaker 22>six and we were living with my </v>
<v Speaker 22>grandmother going to church sunday </v>

3469
02:50:35.071 --> 02:50:36.450
<v Speaker 22>mornings,</v>
<v Speaker 22>sunday night,</v>

3470
02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:39.390
<v Speaker 22>wednesday night methodist church,</v>
<v Speaker 22>little north Texas town,</v>

3471
02:50:39.870 --> 02:50:44.870
<v Speaker 22>sitting in sunday school looking out the</v>
<v Speaker 22>window at the tree and the swing.</v>

3472
02:50:45.180 --> 02:50:46.950
<v Speaker 22>And so I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 22>god,</v>

3473
02:50:46.951 --> 02:50:49.860
<v Speaker 22>I'd rather be eating place.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Um,</v>

3474
02:50:50.490 --> 02:50:55.110
<v Speaker 22>I think probably realistically about the</v>
<v Speaker 22>time I figured out santa wasn't real.</v>

3475
02:50:55.470 --> 02:50:58.050
<v Speaker 22>I had the same kind of questions are </v>
<v Speaker 22>about the stories I'd been,</v>

3476
02:50:58.290 --> 02:51:02.460
<v Speaker 22>I'd been taught.</v>
<v Speaker 22>So for about as long as I can remember,</v>

3477
02:51:02.461 --> 02:51:03.540
<v Speaker 22>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 22>Yeah.</v>

3478
02:51:03.570 --> 02:51:06.990
<v Speaker 22>So one of the other things you mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 22>is that you're,</v>

3479
02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:12.100
<v Speaker 22>you're sort of fascinated by how a </v>
<v Speaker 22>christians and and just religious people</v>

3480
02:51:12.631 --> 02:51:15.360
<v Speaker 22>in general are often deceived by their </v>
<v Speaker 22>sources.</v>

3481
02:51:15.361 --> 02:51:18.900
<v Speaker 22>So it's not even necessarily the source </v>
<v Speaker 22>itself,</v>

3482
02:51:18.901 --> 02:51:21.060
<v Speaker 22>right?</v>
<v Speaker 22>It's not necessarily the book itself,</v>

3483
02:51:21.090 --> 02:51:25.230
<v Speaker 22>but it's sort of the messengers that are</v>
<v Speaker 22>the deceivers am I getting what you said</v>

3484
02:51:25.560 --> 02:51:27.960
<v Speaker 22>correctly?</v>
<v Speaker 22>I think it's both those things,</v>

3485
02:51:28.050 --> 02:51:29.160
<v Speaker 22>um,</v>
<v Speaker 22>you know,</v>

3486
02:51:29.161 --> 02:51:31.440
<v Speaker 22>if you look at abrahamic religions </v>
<v Speaker 22>today,</v>

3487
02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:32.633
<v Speaker 22>they don't have what we consider to be </v>
<v Speaker 22>basic hardcore evidence for their </v>

3488
02:51:36.061 --> 02:51:36.894
<v Speaker 22>claims.</v>
<v Speaker 22>The only thing they have a for a source </v>

3489
02:51:39.870 --> 02:51:40.703
<v Speaker 22>or books that stem out of oral </v>
<v Speaker 22>traditions that stem out in ancient </v>

3490
02:51:44.341 --> 02:51:45.174
<v Speaker 22>manuscripts that had been copied and </v>
<v Speaker 22>recopied and copied and changed and </v>

3491
02:51:48.091 --> 02:51:48.924
<v Speaker 22>different.</v>

3492
02:51:48.990 --> 02:51:53.990
<v Speaker 22>So I think there's a problem because the</v>
<v Speaker 22>people who are there pastors and who are</v>

3493
02:51:56.731 --> 02:51:57.564
<v Speaker 22>their priest and go to divinity school,</v>
<v Speaker 22>they understand the history of their </v>

3494
02:52:00.931 --> 02:52:03.120
<v Speaker 22>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 22>they know the questions involved,</v>

3495
02:52:03.121 --> 02:52:03.954
<v Speaker 22>they know the contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 22>they know that a lot of this is really </v>

3496
02:52:06.581 --> 02:52:07.414
<v Speaker 22>false,</v>
<v Speaker 22>but they don't tell that to their </v>

3497
02:52:09.131 --> 02:52:09.964
<v Speaker 22>congregations.</v>
<v Speaker 22>So the people who hear this really have </v>

3498
02:52:13.031 --> 02:52:17.350
<v Speaker 22>no independent way of judging whether </v>
<v Speaker 22>this is real or not.</v>

3499
02:52:17.351 --> 02:52:20.470
<v Speaker 22>So if I have a book,</v>
<v Speaker 22>somebody giving me a book and says,</v>

3500
02:52:20.471 --> 02:52:21.610
<v Speaker 22>look,</v>
<v Speaker 22>this is reality.</v>

3501
02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:24.760
<v Speaker 22>I have some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 22>well where it come from,</v>

3502
02:52:25.510 --> 02:52:27.130
<v Speaker 22>what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 22>How do we know?</v>

3503
02:52:27.131 --> 02:52:28.670
<v Speaker 22>What it says is true,</v>
<v Speaker 22>etc.</v>

3504
02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:32.530
<v Speaker 22>So digging back into those sources and </v>
<v Speaker 22>being able to come up with what we think</v>

3505
02:52:32.531 --> 02:52:33.364
<v Speaker 22>are historically realistic stories about</v>
<v Speaker 22>all of this helps people to be a little </v>

3506
02:52:37.601 --> 02:52:41.980
<v Speaker 22>bit more critical and judge the things </v>
<v Speaker 22>that they just take on faith.</v>

3507
02:52:42.230 --> 02:52:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things when I've talked to</v>

3508
02:52:44.631 --> 02:52:45.464
<v Speaker 1>other atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I talk about atheism in </v>

3509
02:52:47.121 --> 02:52:47.954
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the questions I get is people </v>

3510
02:52:50.001 --> 02:52:50.241
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3511
02:52:50.241 --> 02:52:52.250
<v Speaker 1>how do you have a moral center?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>

3512
02:52:52.430 --> 02:52:56.630
<v Speaker 1>How were you able to have a code that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you live by without religion?</v>

3513
02:52:56.631 --> 02:52:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I think you're laughing already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta gave away your answer,</v>

3514
02:52:59.270 --> 02:53:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but tell me how have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How have,</v>

3515
02:53:00.881 --> 02:53:04.190
<v Speaker 1>what have you based your moral center </v>
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

3516
02:53:05.180 --> 02:53:07.310
<v Speaker 22>What do I base my moral center on?</v>
<v Speaker 22>Well,</v>

3517
02:53:07.311 --> 02:53:11.150
<v Speaker 22>like I tell you know,</v>
<v Speaker 22>we have two adopted kids there.</v>

3518
02:53:11.180 --> 02:53:12.013
<v Speaker 22>They're adults these days and they're </v>
<v Speaker 22>doing quite well and one of the reasons </v>

3519
02:53:15.051 --> 02:53:18.890
<v Speaker 22>that they're doing well is because they </v>
<v Speaker 22>know what's right and what's not right.</v>

3520
02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:20.113
<v Speaker 22>You have this.</v>
<v Speaker 22>I think humans have this inherent </v>

3521
02:53:24.110 --> 02:53:28.070
<v Speaker 22>ability to to understand that the right </v>
<v Speaker 22>way to act,</v>

3522
02:53:28.071 --> 02:53:28.904
<v Speaker 22>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 22>is the way you act when nobody is </v>

3523
02:53:30.530 --> 02:53:31.363
<v Speaker 22>watching you.</v>
<v Speaker 22>You come out of this feeling of </v>

3524
02:53:33.770 --> 02:53:34.603
<v Speaker 22>compassion for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 22>You come out of this feeling of being </v>

3525
02:53:37.011 --> 02:53:40.470
<v Speaker 22>able to help other people and to be </v>
<v Speaker 22>basically a good person.</v>

3526
02:53:40.490 --> 02:53:45.490
<v Speaker 22>I mean sociopath's aside are normally </v>
<v Speaker 22>constructed human being,</v>

3527
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:48.590
<v Speaker 22>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 22>I feel that you understand this.</v>

3528
02:53:48.591 --> 02:53:50.330
<v Speaker 22>I mean the greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 22>I understood it,</v>

3529
02:53:50.331 --> 02:53:53.630
<v Speaker 22>the romans understood it.</v>
<v Speaker 22>The plains indians understood it,</v>

3530
02:53:53.930 --> 02:53:54.763
<v Speaker 22>right?</v>
<v Speaker 22>They,</v>

3531
02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:58.000
<v Speaker 22>they are all allied to different </v>
<v Speaker 22>religious system,</v>

3532
02:53:58.001 --> 02:53:58.834
<v Speaker 22>so it's not an.</v>
<v Speaker 22>It's not something out of a religious </v>

3533
02:54:01.430 --> 02:54:04.880
<v Speaker 22>tradition or a book that says follow </v>
<v Speaker 22>these rules.</v>

3534
02:54:05.480 --> 02:54:06.620
<v Speaker 22>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 22>you know,</v>

3535
02:54:06.621 --> 02:54:09.860
<v Speaker 22>it's wrong if you kill somebody in </v>
<v Speaker 22>murder,</v>

3536
02:54:09.861 --> 02:54:12.590
<v Speaker 22>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 22>that's just human basic wrong.</v>

3537
02:54:12.980 --> 02:54:13.813
<v Speaker 22>And I don't think it takes an ancient </v>
<v Speaker 22>book and dictates from when the guy in </v>

3538
02:54:17.961 --> 02:54:20.450
<v Speaker 22>the sky to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 22>do this and you're in trouble.</v>

3539
02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it does,</v>

3540
02:54:21.611 --> 02:54:24.190
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a bigger problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bigger problem,</v>

3541
02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:25.211
<v Speaker 1>a bigger problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

3542
02:54:25.211 --> 02:54:25.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3543
02:54:25.720 --> 02:54:28.060
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately have to wrap it up but let</v>
<v Speaker 1>people know.</v>

3544
02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're working on a book.</v>

3545
02:54:29.471 --> 02:54:30.700

<v Speaker 22>into secular situation.</v>

3553

3558
02:55:05.001 --> 02:55:07.610
<v Speaker 22>message that underlies this,</v>
<v Speaker 22>right,</v>

3559
02:55:07.850 --> 02:55:08.683
<v Speaker 22>that all of these myths and everything </v>
<v Speaker 22>may have come from some particular </v>

3560
02:55:11.961 --> 02:55:12.794
<v Speaker 22>historical actors and people,</v>
<v Speaker 22>but they're not necessarily what people </v>

3561
02:55:16.761 --> 02:55:18.290
<v Speaker 22>are trying to get us to believe today.</v>

3580
02:56:06.761 --> 02:56:08.560
<v Speaker 3>We don't hear much about Ireland in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>news.</v>

3581
02:56:08.590 --> 02:56:09.423
<v Speaker 3>How's it going over there?</v>

3582
02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:12.313
<v Speaker 23>You won't heAr much about us,</v>
<v Speaker 23>but we just had a new government forms </v>

3583
02:56:18.250 --> 02:56:21.330
<v Speaker 23>10 weeks after her election.</v>
<v Speaker 23>Miraculously.</v>

3584
02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:23.530
<v Speaker 23>No fan does.</v>
<v Speaker 23>There's a lot of discussion kind of.</v>

3585
02:56:24.070 --> 02:56:24.903
<v Speaker 23>And we have,</v>
<v Speaker 23>we have water charges were brought in </v>

3586
02:56:26.141 --> 02:56:28.900
<v Speaker 23>and that's been discussed a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 23>Um,</v>

02:56:29.150 --> 02:56:29.983
<v Speaker 23>the,</v>
<v Speaker 23>the fire life doesn't end the socialist </v>

3588
02:56:31.751 --> 02:56:33.160
<v Speaker 23>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 23>They're not very happy with it.</v>

3589
02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:37.030
<v Speaker 23>Neither any really apart from the </v>
<v Speaker 23>parties and governments.</v>

3590
02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:41.290
<v Speaker 23>And there's discussion over repeating </v>
<v Speaker 23>our eighth amendment,</v>

3591
02:56:41.291 --> 02:56:42.124
<v Speaker 23>which is basically stipulates stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 23>Abortion is legal and artists and </v>

3592
02:56:49.710 --> 02:56:51.900
<v Speaker 23>obviously in the google phones we,</v>
<v Speaker 23>um,</v>

3593
02:56:52.060 --> 02:56:54.250
<v Speaker 23>last year we legalized marriage for </v>
<v Speaker 23>homosexuals,</v>

3594
02:56:55.090 --> 02:56:56.290
<v Speaker 23>which is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 23>Uh,</v>

3595
02:56:56.291 --> 02:56:57.460
<v Speaker 23>I wasn't in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 23>I was,</v>

3596
02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:59.200
<v Speaker 23>I was actually abroad in China for the </v>
<v Speaker 23>year,</v>

3597
02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:00.433
<v Speaker 23>um,</v>
<v Speaker 23>you know,</v>

3598
02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:02.800
<v Speaker 23>if you're irish abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 23>which I was,</v>

3599
02:57:03.490 --> 02:57:05.330
<v Speaker 23>I wasn't too happy and I couldn't go </v>
<v Speaker 23>was,</v>

3600
02:57:05.590 --> 02:57:06.423
<v Speaker 23>that was brilliant.</v>

3601
02:57:07.170 --> 02:57:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's pause there for a second.</v>

3602
02:57:09.331 --> 02:57:10.164
<v Speaker 3>So that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you guys voted for legalizing gay </v>

3603
02:57:13.471 --> 02:57:15.960
<v Speaker 3>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is obviously very great and a very</v>

3604
02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:18.000
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive concept.</v>

3605
02:57:18.180 --> 02:57:20.340
<v Speaker 3>And then at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're telling me that they're voting on</v>

3606
02:57:20.341 --> 02:57:23.550
<v Speaker 3>possibly repealing a law that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3607
02:57:23.580 --> 02:57:24.570
<v Speaker 3>that allows abortion.</v>

3608
02:57:24.990 --> 02:57:26.010
<v Speaker 23>No,</v>
<v Speaker 23>no.</v>

3609
02:57:27.970 --> 02:57:28.803
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so abortion is abortion coMpletely </v>

3610
02:57:30.201 --> 02:57:31.034
<v Speaker 3>illegal?</v>

3611
02:57:31.130 --> 02:57:32.070
<v Speaker 23>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 23>it's illegal.</v>

3612
02:57:32.860 --> 02:57:33.693
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3613
02:57:33.730 --> 02:57:36.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to do prp.</v>

3614
02:57:36.230 --> 02:57:38.680
<v Speaker 3>I assume people are having illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>abortions because people have them,</v>

3615
02:57:38.890 --> 02:57:40.150
<v Speaker 3>whether it's legal or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3616
02:57:41.080 --> 02:57:42.460
<v Speaker 23>Generally heading over to england.</v>

3617
02:57:43.170 --> 02:57:44.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you.</v>

3618
02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:46.590
<v Speaker 3>So do you think the law is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pass?</v>

3619
02:57:47.740 --> 02:57:52.740
<v Speaker 23>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 23>I would say there was a savior died last</v>

3620
02:57:53.270 --> 02:57:54.030
<v Speaker 23>year.</v>
<v Speaker 23>There was unsafe.</v>

3621
02:57:54.030 --> 02:57:58.520
<v Speaker 23>And when opposition from perhaps with </v>
<v Speaker 23>charities and stuff against,</v>

3622
02:57:58.521 --> 02:58:00.410
<v Speaker 23>um,</v>
<v Speaker 23>against gay marriage,</v>

3623
02:58:02.220 --> 02:58:03.100
<v Speaker 23>no one really cares</v>

3624
02:58:05.060 --> 02:58:06.130
<v Speaker 3>are the churches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3625
02:58:06.150 --> 02:58:08.410
<v Speaker 3>are they losing their power quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

3626
02:58:08.411 --> 02:58:10.980
<v Speaker 3>how much power do they actually hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>over politics these days?</v>

3627
02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:21.780
<v Speaker 23>You don't get too many people's onto my </v>
<v Speaker 23>house and they don't take it seriously.</v>

3628
02:58:21.790 --> 02:58:24.790
<v Speaker 23>And most of our is very,</v>
<v Speaker 23>you know,</v>

3629
02:58:25.030 --> 02:58:28.090
<v Speaker 23>with regards to say homosexuality or </v>
<v Speaker 23>whatever.</v>

3630
02:58:28.290 --> 02:58:32.750
<v Speaker 23>Generally as a country we're generally </v>
<v Speaker 23>quite alright with it would require that</v>

3631
02:58:32.850 --> 02:58:35.800
<v Speaker 23>our country basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 23>as long as you don't annoy me,</v>

3632
02:58:36.210 --> 02:58:39.010
<v Speaker 23>I don't really care what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 23>You know what I mean?</v>

3633
02:58:39.780 --> 02:58:41.590
<v Speaker 3>That's my personal ideology to</v>

3634
02:58:42.260 --> 02:58:43.093
<v Speaker 23>perfect.</v>

3635
02:58:43.140 --> 02:58:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get entirely the obviously.</v>

3636
02:58:45.570 --> 02:58:47.230
<v Speaker 3>So you're studying politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3637
02:58:47.580 --> 02:58:48.413
<v Speaker 23>Yeah.</v>

3638
02:58:48.730 --> 02:58:50.350
<v Speaker 3>What got you interested in politics?</v>

3639
02:58:51.140 --> 02:58:53.440
<v Speaker 23>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 23>I can't really remember.</v>

3640
02:58:53.441 --> 02:58:56.210
<v Speaker 23>I think I just really wanted a,</v>
<v Speaker 23>I don't know,</v>

3641
02:58:56.220 --> 02:58:57.053
<v Speaker 23>maybe maybe it was probably the </v>
<v Speaker 23>elevation with that new understanding </v>

3642
02:59:01.421 --> 02:59:03.400
<v Speaker 23>african children and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 23>And you want to be like,</v>

02:59:03.401 --> 02:59:05.260
<v Speaker 23>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 23>I'd love to help someone like that.</v>

3644
02:59:05.261 --> 02:59:10.160
<v Speaker 23>I'm just kind of grill and grill was </v>
<v Speaker 23>very interested in wars and I did,</v>

3645
02:59:10.420 --> 02:59:11.253
<v Speaker 23>I did a module last semester which was </v>
<v Speaker 23>ethnic conflict was that little of </v>

3646
02:59:14.670 --> 02:59:15.503
<v Speaker 23>monsters in the conflict doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 23>So it's a lot of work in the united </v>

3647
02:59:20.731 --> 02:59:23.260
<v Speaker 23>nation to my thought and a conflict </v>
<v Speaker 23>resolution.</v>

3648
02:59:23.650 --> 02:59:27.380
<v Speaker 23>I've actually my team final exam for the</v>
<v Speaker 23>whole,</v>

3649
02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:31.030
<v Speaker 23>my whole undergraduate artS began,</v>
<v Speaker 23>so I'll be doing on saturday.</v>

3650
02:59:31.510 --> 02:59:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

3651
02:59:32.260 --> 02:59:34.440
<v Speaker 3>Well thanks for taking some time then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how.</v>

3652
02:59:34.441 --> 02:59:35.274
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that you wanted to </v>

3653
02:59:36.701 --> 02:59:37.534
<v Speaker 3>talk to me about is one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that pretty much everybody wanted to </v>

3654
02:59:40.391 --> 02:59:41.224
<v Speaker 3>talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is political correctness and how </v>

3655
02:59:44.201 --> 02:59:45.910
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it's seeping into society.</v>

3656
02:59:45.911 --> 02:59:47.650
<v Speaker 3>So what's going on on that front in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ireland?</v>

3657
02:59:48.570 --> 02:59:50.280
<v Speaker 23>um,</v>
<v Speaker 23>I think,</v>

3658
02:59:52.080 --> 02:59:52.913
<v Speaker 23>I think a lot of the stuff you see,</v>
<v Speaker 23>ideas of racism and stuff are imported </v>

3659
02:59:58.220 --> 02:59:59.420
<v Speaker 23>from America.</v>
<v Speaker 23>We all think,</v>

3660
02:59:59.450 --> 03:00:00.283
<v Speaker 23>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 23>he probleMs with race in America is a </v>

3661
03:00:01.761 --> 03:00:04.580
<v Speaker 23>very specific problem with racing.</v>
<v Speaker 23>You know what I mean?</v>

3662
03:00:04.970 --> 03:00:06.140
<v Speaker 23>And we think,</v>
<v Speaker 23>oh my god,</v>

3663
03:00:06.141 --> 03:00:07.440
<v Speaker 23>you're racist towards black people.</v>
<v Speaker 23>Got,</v>

3664
03:00:07.480 --> 03:00:09.260
<v Speaker 23>we never had that because,</v>
<v Speaker 23>you know,</v>

3665
03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:12.890
<v Speaker 23>we don't even our own country for nike,</v>
<v Speaker 23>nike for years,</v>

3666
03:00:13.020 --> 03:00:14.270
<v Speaker 23>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 23>25 years,</v>

3667
03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:15.153
<v Speaker 23>right.</v>
<v Speaker 23>Um,</v>

3668
03:00:15.930 --> 03:00:16.763
<v Speaker 23>we'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 23>we'll get people is generally higher </v>

3669
03:00:18.470 --> 03:00:20.680
<v Speaker 23>lefty for people in the,</v>
<v Speaker 23>on the social spectrum.</v>

3670
03:00:21.070 --> 03:00:21.903
<v Speaker 23>I'm not saying you,</v>
<v Speaker 23>you don't have to social stuff seat to </v>

3671
03:00:23.071 --> 03:00:25.170
<v Speaker 23>be ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 23>you know,</v>

3672
03:00:25.460 --> 03:00:26.340
<v Speaker 23>as,</v>
<v Speaker 23>as,</v>

3673
03:00:26.341 --> 03:00:28.620
<v Speaker 23>um,</v>
<v Speaker 23>as marginal as to saying,</v>

3674
03:00:28.621 --> 03:00:29.454
<v Speaker 23>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 23>regressive left and off and you get </v>

3675
03:00:31.321 --> 03:00:32.250
<v Speaker 23>that.</v>
<v Speaker 23>We had that.</v>

3676
03:00:32.420 --> 03:00:35.290
<v Speaker 23>She was dealing with the german group </v>
<v Speaker 23>together to heat up.</v>

3677
03:00:36.060 --> 03:00:39.390
<v Speaker 23>They had a protest here.</v>
<v Speaker 23>It was like a hundred people,</v>

3678
03:00:39.430 --> 03:00:40.190
<v Speaker 23>300 people.</v>
<v Speaker 23>So</v>

3679
03:00:40.190 --> 03:00:41.023
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not really picking up steam </v>

3680
03:00:42.121 --> 03:00:42.954
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3681
03:00:43.010 --> 03:00:44.450
<v Speaker 23>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 23>this particular incident,</v>

3682
03:00:44.451 --> 03:00:48.590
<v Speaker 23>they were chased down the street by,</v>
<v Speaker 23>by a counter protestors to which we were</v>

3683
03:00:48.591 --> 03:00:49.900
<v Speaker 23>like,</v>
<v Speaker 23>I,</v>

3684
03:00:50.450 --> 03:00:52.300
<v Speaker 23>I totally disagree with that reads.</v>
<v Speaker 23>They're racist,</v>

3685
03:00:52.301 --> 03:00:53.134
<v Speaker 23>they're fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 23>whatever,</v>

3686
03:00:53.170 --> 03:00:54.003
<v Speaker 23>but up behind themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 23>But I think in art and we're doing okay </v>

3687
03:00:58.031 --> 03:00:58.864
<v Speaker 23>and when you look,</v>
<v Speaker 23>we see stuff or having an american law </v>

3688
03:01:00.820 --> 03:01:01.653
<v Speaker 23>walking by it</v>

3689
03:01:05.070 --> 03:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>for everything that's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering,</v>

3690
03:01:07.500 --> 03:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>wondering about some of it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>

3691
03:01:09.900 --> 03:01:11.150
<v Speaker 23>I,</v>
<v Speaker 23>I think we're okay,</v>

3692
03:01:11.900 --> 03:01:14.660
<v Speaker 23>but I mean when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 23>when it comes to terrorist attacks,</v>

3693
03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:18.560
<v Speaker 23>I'm criticizing islam.</v>
<v Speaker 23>You do get some really known.</v>

3694
03:01:18.650 --> 03:01:22.660
<v Speaker 23>Is onsite is the use of islam in a </v>
<v Speaker 23>violent way?</v>

3695
03:01:22.670 --> 03:01:24.560
<v Speaker 23>Use of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 23>What?</v>

3696
03:01:24.590 --> 03:01:27.500
<v Speaker 23>I mentioned the underclass and hoodie </v>
<v Speaker 23>when he looks.</v>

3697
03:01:28.210 --> 03:01:29.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been one of the through lines </v>

3698
03:01:30.881 --> 03:01:31.714
<v Speaker 1>here because we're just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and you mentioned an idea and you </v>

3699
03:01:34.901 --> 03:01:36.250
<v Speaker 1>get some funny looks in class.</v>

3700
03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:37.551
<v Speaker 23>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 23>But no,</v>

3701
03:01:37.551 --> 03:01:41.520
<v Speaker 23>no one is known as shutting me down.</v>
<v Speaker 23>Naming this safe space,</v>

3702
03:01:41.521 --> 03:01:42.540
<v Speaker 23>which is progress.</v>

3703
03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:44.313
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys don't have safe spaces and </v>

3704
03:01:45.481 --> 03:01:46.314
<v Speaker 1>trigger warnings?</v>

3705
03:01:46.950 --> 03:01:47.783
<v Speaker 23>No.</v>
<v Speaker 23>If he smiled or university and they're </v>

3706
03:01:49.871 --> 03:01:51.700
<v Speaker 23>too small,</v>
<v Speaker 23>I've been.</v>

3707
03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:52.960
<v Speaker 23>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 23>it hasn't caught on yet.</v>

3708
03:01:53.500 --> 03:01:54.333
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a combo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe have small universities and a lot </v>

3709
03:01:56.051 --> 03:01:57.460
<v Speaker 1>of beer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that be fair to say?</v>

3710
03:01:59.680 --> 03:02:00.513
<v Speaker 23>No,</v>
<v Speaker 23>I think it's not showing up the class </v>

3711
03:02:01.330 --> 03:02:02.550
<v Speaker 23>because of the period before.</v>

3712
03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>

3713
03:02:05.890 --> 03:02:06.723
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a pleasure talking to you and if </v>

3714
03:02:08.781 --> 03:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>you have any other fashion </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommendations,</v>

3715
03:02:10.401 --> 03:02:11.620
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3716
03:02:11.630 --> 03:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I am on with brianna in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brianna,</v>

3717
03:02:14.541 --> 03:02:15.374
<v Speaker 1>how are ya?</v>

3718
03:02:16.050 --> 03:02:17.340
<v Speaker 24>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 24>how are you?</v>

3719
03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So according to my notes here,</v>

3720
03:02:20.300 --> 03:02:24.230
<v Speaker 1>you are in Japan via Tennessee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people can say that?</v>

3721
03:02:25.080 --> 03:02:26.900
<v Speaker 24>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 24>not very many.</v>

3722
03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:28.033
<v Speaker 24>So from personal experience they </v>
<v Speaker 24>probably don't even know to see is here </v>

3723
03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:34.670
<v Speaker 24>99 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 24>So yeah.</v>

3724
03:02:34.671 --> 03:02:35.900
<v Speaker 24>So tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 24>imagine,</v>

3725
03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:37.063
<v Speaker 1>tell me a little bit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you grew up in Tennessee and when </v>

3726
03:02:39.171 --> 03:02:40.790
<v Speaker 1>did you move to Japan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing there?</v>

3727
03:02:40.791 --> 03:02:41.624
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

3728
03:02:42.750 --> 03:02:44.430
<v Speaker 24>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 24>so I grew up in Tennessee.</v>

3729
03:02:44.670 --> 03:02:45.503
<v Speaker 24>I was there for 18 years of my life </v>
<v Speaker 24>until I moved to philadelphia for </v>

3730
03:02:49.591 --> 03:02:54.240
<v Speaker 24>college and I've been in Japan for the </v>
<v Speaker 24>past six months now,</v>

3731
03:02:54.450 --> 03:02:59.450
<v Speaker 24>or study abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 24>I'll be here a bit longer and let's see,</v>

3732
03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:03.300
<v Speaker 24>in Japan they know what the Tennessee </v>
<v Speaker 24>waltz is and that's about it.</v>

3733
03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:06.600
<v Speaker 24>I don't even know what that song is.</v>
<v Speaker 24>I figured out about it when I was here.</v>

3734
03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:11.850
<v Speaker 24>It's an oldie,</v>
<v Speaker 24>I think their knowledGe of the states.</v>

3735
03:03:11.980 --> 03:03:12.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

3736
03:03:13.040 --> 03:03:15.780
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so six months in Japan,</v>

3737
03:03:15.850 --> 03:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>how have you been having major culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>shock?</v>

3738
03:03:18.460 --> 03:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>What do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What don't you like?</v>

3739
03:03:19.901 --> 03:03:20.734
<v Speaker 1>Has it gone?</v>

3740
03:03:21.730 --> 03:03:22.040
<v Speaker 21>Hm.</v>

3741
03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:22.873
<v Speaker 24>It has been pretty good so far.</v>
<v Speaker 24>The culture shock isn't as bad as I </v>

3742
03:03:26.120 --> 03:03:27.980
<v Speaker 24>thought it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 24>No,</v>

3743
03:03:28.220 --> 03:03:30.530
<v Speaker 24>it's pretty globalized world at this </v>
<v Speaker 24>point.</v>

3744
03:03:30.531 --> 03:03:33.920
<v Speaker 24>So you know what Japan is like </v>
<v Speaker 24>difference wise.</v>

3745
03:03:34.730 --> 03:03:39.730
<v Speaker 24>So it's been pretty good so far the </v>
<v Speaker 24>biggest difference has been the academic</v>

3746
03:03:40.611 --> 03:03:41.444
<v Speaker 24>system.</v>
<v Speaker 24>So it's pretty fundamentally different </v>

3747
03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:48.830
<v Speaker 24>from american conceptions of education.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Yeah.</v>

3748
03:03:48.850 --> 03:03:49.950
<v Speaker 24>So that's one of the things.</v>

3749
03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:51.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that you </v>

3750
03:03:52.451 --> 03:03:53.284
<v Speaker 1>had written in that you wanted to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a little bit about academia and </v>

3751
03:03:55.541 --> 03:03:57.320
<v Speaker 1>the difference between America and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

3752
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:58.070
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

3753
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.903
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do that.</v>

3754
03:04:00.210 --> 03:04:01.043
<v Speaker 24>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 24>So it's essentially been really </v>

3755
03:04:03.131 --> 03:04:03.964
<v Speaker 24>refreshinG being here because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 24>them more and knowing aspects of </v>

3756
03:04:09.041 --> 03:04:12.460
<v Speaker 24>american academia are not present here </v>
<v Speaker 24>at the moment.</v>

3757
03:04:12.490 --> 03:04:15.790
<v Speaker 24>They might be later on in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Right.</v>

3758
03:04:15.850 --> 03:04:16.683
<v Speaker 24>So like what for example,</v>
<v Speaker 24>so like the big issue with academia </v>

3759
03:04:21.031 --> 03:04:21.864
<v Speaker 24>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 24>as you can imagine is the ideological </v>

3760
03:04:27.200 --> 03:04:29.970
<v Speaker 24>like constraints placed on lots of </v>
<v Speaker 24>students there.</v>

3761
03:04:30.360 --> 03:04:34.500
<v Speaker 24>But college in Japan is not a very </v>
<v Speaker 24>ideological place.</v>

3762
03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:37.820
<v Speaker 24>Like the classroom is a sacred </v>
<v Speaker 24>environment.</v>

3763
03:04:37.890 --> 03:04:40.920
<v Speaker 24>You do not talk about ideological things</v>
<v Speaker 24>there.</v>

3764
03:04:42.180 --> 03:04:43.013
<v Speaker 24>So it's pretty much not an issue which </v>
<v Speaker 24>has been really good for me because </v>

3765
03:04:47.131 --> 03:04:47.964
<v Speaker 24>that's one of the reasons I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 24>come to Japan to avoid that because my </v>

3766
03:04:52.531 --> 03:04:57.531
<v Speaker 24>college is very stereotypical,</v>
<v Speaker 24>very liberal and very free speech sensor</v>

3767
03:04:59.781 --> 03:05:01.860
<v Speaker 24>should be in lots of ways.</v>

3768
03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:02.833
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of the people that I've been </v>

3769
03:05:03.831 --> 03:05:06.390
<v Speaker 3>talking to today are mentioning things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and we,</v>

3770
03:05:06.440 --> 03:05:08.690
<v Speaker 3>we know about all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in Japan,</v>

3771
03:05:08.691 --> 03:05:13.160
<v Speaker 3>is there a drawback to having sorta of </v>
<v Speaker 3>no ideology in the classroom?</v>

3772
03:05:13.161 --> 03:05:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Like is there any kind of drawbacks to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just sort of straight information?</v>

3773
03:05:18.180 --> 03:05:19.013
<v Speaker 24>There is a bit of a drawback.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Japan's academic structure has its own </v>

3774
03:05:22.521 --> 03:05:24.860
<v Speaker 24>issues that I could complain about all </v>
<v Speaker 24>day.</v>

3775
03:05:26.570 --> 03:05:27.403
<v Speaker 24>We only have eight minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 24>I know compared to the issues with </v>

3776
03:05:31.401 --> 03:05:32.234
<v Speaker 24>America right now.</v>
<v Speaker 24>I could deal with theM way more because </v>

3777
03:05:36.171 --> 03:05:37.004
<v Speaker 24>that's essentially just me saying why do</v>
<v Speaker 24>I have to respect the teacher all the </v>

3778
03:05:39.621 --> 03:05:40.670
<v Speaker 24>time?</v>
<v Speaker 24>I'm american,</v>

3779
03:05:40.671 --> 03:05:45.671
<v Speaker 24>I don't respect people.</v>
<v Speaker 24>So that's really the main issue.</v>

3780
03:05:46.730 --> 03:05:47.563
<v Speaker 24>But like information being presented </v>
<v Speaker 24>here just so straightforwardly really </v>

3781
03:05:51.711 --> 03:05:52.544
<v Speaker 24>does seem to help like nip the </v>
<v Speaker 24>ideological issues in the bud there </v>

3782
03:05:57.140 --> 03:06:00.200
<v Speaker 24>because that's not something teachers </v>
<v Speaker 24>are supposed to be doing.</v>

3783
03:06:00.360 --> 03:06:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how has it for you,</v>

3784
03:06:01.981 --> 03:06:03.720
<v Speaker 3>you said you'd been there for six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months,</v>

3785
03:06:03.770 --> 03:06:05.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being uh,</v>

3786
03:06:06.090 --> 03:06:08.820
<v Speaker 3>an outsider in a pretty homogeneous </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

3787
03:06:08.821 --> 03:06:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Have you had any challenges on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>front?</v>

3788
03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.540
<v Speaker 24>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 24>I actually have nights.</v>

3789
03:06:14.660 --> 03:06:16.820
<v Speaker 24>It's pretty interesting like people </v>
<v Speaker 24>stare at you,</v>

3790
03:06:16.910 --> 03:06:19.550
<v Speaker 24>but people stare at anyone who isn't </v>
<v Speaker 24>japanese here.</v>

3791
03:06:19.640 --> 03:06:20.473
<v Speaker 24>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 24>I think 99 point seven percent of the </v>

3792
03:06:23.211 --> 03:06:27.290
<v Speaker 24>people here at japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 24>And the points three people who are left</v>

3793
03:06:27.291 --> 03:06:28.124
<v Speaker 24>are mostly korean and chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 24>But you're an oddity no matter what you </v>

3794
03:06:31.521 --> 03:06:35.060
<v Speaker 24>look like if you're from the west.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Do you speak japanese?</v>

3795
03:06:36.260 --> 03:06:40.570
<v Speaker 24>I speak japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Aired quote gary,</v>

3796
03:06:41.020 --> 03:06:42.230
<v Speaker 24>don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 24>I'm not going to test you.</v>

3797
03:06:42.231 --> 03:06:44.930
<v Speaker 24>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 24>I started studying in college,</v>

3798
03:06:44.931 --> 03:06:47.510
<v Speaker 24>so I am in no way fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Yeah,</v>

3799
03:06:47.850 --> 03:06:51.140
<v Speaker 24>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Speak enough to prize people greatly.</v>

3800
03:06:51.680 --> 03:06:52.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that you had </v>

3801
03:06:53.391 --> 03:06:55.680
<v Speaker 3>written in that you wanted to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I thought was really interesting</v>

3802
03:06:56.220 --> 03:07:00.420
<v Speaker 1>was about content creators being </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfairly criticized.</v>

3803
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:01.463
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think what you were referring to </v>

3804
03:07:03.061 --> 03:07:03.894
<v Speaker 1>is generally just sort of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtubers that put their thoughts out </v>

3805
03:07:05.941 --> 03:07:08.550
<v Speaker 1>there that ended up getting trolled </v>
<v Speaker 1>endlessly.</v>

3806
03:07:08.551 --> 03:07:10.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the sense that I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I,</v>

3807
03:07:10.201 --> 03:07:11.460
<v Speaker 1>am I right on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if not,</v>

3808
03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:13.530
<v Speaker 24>please correct me.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Yeah,</v>

3809
03:07:13.730 --> 03:07:14.563
<v Speaker 24>there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 24>And then there's the broader sense of </v>

3810
03:07:17.241 --> 03:07:18.074
<v Speaker 24>content creation where it's like there </v>
<v Speaker 24>are people who are writing books or </v>

3811
03:07:21.081 --> 03:07:21.914
<v Speaker 24>making comics or movies that are being </v>
<v Speaker 24>endlessly criticized with a very </v>

3812
03:07:27.050 --> 03:07:27.883
<v Speaker 24>ideological bents at this point to the </v>
<v Speaker 24>point where not meeting certain very </v>

3813
03:07:33.291 --> 03:07:34.124
<v Speaker 24>leftist standards is considered a </v>
<v Speaker 24>drawback in a fault when it probably </v>

3814
03:07:37.791 --> 03:07:39.360
<v Speaker 24>shouldn't inherently be.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Yeah.</v>

3815
03:07:39.610 --> 03:07:41.180
<v Speaker 24>So give me,</v>
<v Speaker 24>give me an example of that.</v>

3816
03:07:42.620 --> 03:07:43.453
<v Speaker 24>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 24>it's not like I am mad when women show </v>

3817
03:07:46.581 --> 03:07:47.414
<v Speaker 24>up in comic books,</v>
<v Speaker 24>but I don't think it's all that fair </v>

3818
03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:54.140
<v Speaker 24>when you get comic books polled because </v>
<v Speaker 24>they don't have women in them,</v>

3819
03:07:54.500 --> 03:07:56.670
<v Speaker 24>but that's not a drawback.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Yeah.</v>

3820
03:07:57.470 --> 03:08:01.340
<v Speaker 24>So that is the kind of see many years </v>
<v Speaker 24>ago now,</v>

3821
03:08:01.341 --> 03:08:02.174
<v Speaker 24>because I'm old with the joker comic </v>
<v Speaker 24>book cover where the joker was abusing </v>

3822
03:08:06.771 --> 03:08:08.960
<v Speaker 24>bat girl because the joker,</v>
<v Speaker 24>the joker,</v>

3823
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:10.663
<v Speaker 24>but they had that comment but cover </v>
<v Speaker 24>poles and the artists essentially </v>

3824
03:08:13.400 --> 03:08:14.233
<v Speaker 24>blacklisted because they said it </v>
<v Speaker 24>encouraged violence against women and </v>

3825
03:08:18.711 --> 03:08:21.950
<v Speaker 24>that should not have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 24>The joker was a bad guy.</v>

3826
03:08:21.951 --> 03:08:24.000
<v Speaker 24>That's what bad guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Yeah.</v>

3827
03:08:24.500 --> 03:08:25.333
<v Speaker 24>A lot of people seem to really mix up </v>
<v Speaker 24>what characters do versus what the </v>

3828
03:08:30.711 --> 03:08:31.544
<v Speaker 24>author dies.</v>
<v Speaker 24>So it's the George Lucas argument where </v>

3829
03:08:34.521 --> 03:08:38.090
<v Speaker 24>it's just like he put layer in a skimpy </v>
<v Speaker 24>outfits like jabba the hutt,</v>

3830
03:08:38.091 --> 03:08:38.924
<v Speaker 24>but later in a skimpy outfit,</v>
<v Speaker 24>his job in a hives is a bad guy and </v>

3831
03:08:42.171 --> 03:08:44.550
<v Speaker 24>you're supposed to think he's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Yeah.</v>

3832
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:46.400
<v Speaker 24>Do you find that fascinating?</v>

3833
03:08:47.980 --> 03:08:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

3834
03:08:48.841 --> 03:08:49.674
<v Speaker 1>I find that totally fascinating that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people seem incapable of certain amount </v>

3835
03:08:53.291 --> 03:08:56.380
<v Speaker 1>of people are incapable of separating </v>
<v Speaker 1>the artists,</v>

3836
03:08:56.381 --> 03:08:58.690
<v Speaker 1>the creator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Lucas,</v>

3837
03:08:58.691 --> 03:09:00.100
<v Speaker 1>who draws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3838
03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:02.610
<v Speaker 1>comes up with the idea of java and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had it,</v>

3839
03:09:02.680 --> 03:09:03.513
<v Speaker 1>he had a slave and he put her in a sexy </v>
<v Speaker 1>outfit and people think that's him </v>

3840
03:09:07.181 --> 03:09:10.150
<v Speaker 1>imposing his view on what he thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>women should be.</v>

3841
03:09:10.151 --> 03:09:11.110
<v Speaker 1>It's kinda crazy.</v>

3842
03:09:12.220 --> 03:09:13.990
<v Speaker 24>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 24>it's pretty ridiculous.</v>

3843
03:09:13.991 --> 03:09:14.824
<v Speaker 24>I don't wAnt to send George Lucas.</v>
<v Speaker 24>He's done verY objectionable things on </v>

3844
03:09:19.721 --> 03:09:23.620
<v Speaker 24>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 24>Jar jar is that a jar jar knock.</v>

3845
03:09:25.550 --> 03:09:30.190
<v Speaker 24>It's a knock against many,</v>
<v Speaker 24>many aspects of the star wars universe,</v>

3846
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:33.250
<v Speaker 24>but not the slightly a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 24>It is fine.</v>

3847
03:09:33.500 --> 03:09:34.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that star wars is like </v>

3848
03:09:35.451 --> 03:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>everything to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3849
03:09:37.130 --> 03:09:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say right now.</v>

3850
03:09:39.390 --> 03:09:42.270
<v Speaker 24>I'm sure you would agree with me on many</v>
<v Speaker 24>of my complaints.</v>
