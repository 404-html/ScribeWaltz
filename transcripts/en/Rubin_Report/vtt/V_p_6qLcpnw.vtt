00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.643
<v Speaker 1> </v>

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.780
<v Speaker 2>of all the polarizing issues in politics</v>
<v Speaker 2>today and yes,</v>

3
00:00:07.781 --> 00:00:08.614
<v Speaker 2>there are many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The climate change debate is right at </v>

4
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:11.434
<v Speaker 2>the top of the list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Climate change seems to be one of the </v>

5
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 2>year either with us or you're against </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

6
00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:16.654
<v Speaker 2>Topics usually debated by people </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately taking a partisan stance </v>

7
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:22.360
<v Speaker 2>rather than a well thought out position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This past year,</v>

8
00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:23.194
<v Speaker 2>I actually lost a good friend who told </v>
<v Speaker 2>me that she could no longer be </v>

9
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.060
<v Speaker 2>associated with people who leave in </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate climate change,</v>

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 2>and I'm someone who's had such </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations on this very show.</v>

11
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.673
<v Speaker 2>I think the most hate that I ever got </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a Reuben report episode was when I </v>

12
00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:36.274
<v Speaker 2>had Alex Epstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>author of the moral case for fossil </v>

13
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 2>fuels in for a sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex.</v>

14
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 2>His argument isn't against manmade </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change specifically.</v>

15
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:45.184
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's more focused on how to increase </v>

16
00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 2>human prosperity with what we have now.</v>

17
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.983
<v Speaker 2>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his argument is although climate change </v>

18
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:52.204
<v Speaker 2>could be real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuels still have many net </v>

19
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 2>benefits for our society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After endless tweets,</v>

20
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.783
<v Speaker 2>emails and messages from angry people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex did a follow up video on youtube </v>

21
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 2>himself where he answered around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred viewer questions.</v>

22
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.063
<v Speaker 2>Engaging with people who have different </v>
<v Speaker 2>views is exactly what the battle of </v>

23
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 2>ideas is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the flip side of the debate,</v>

24
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.813
<v Speaker 2>I've also sat down with Michael Mann,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a climatologist and the author of the </v>

25
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:18.310
<v Speaker 2>famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hockey stick and the climate wars,</v>

26
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 2>who's a thought leader in the climate </v>
<v Speaker 2>change debate.</v>

27
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.023
<v Speaker 2>I've discussed climate change to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree or another with believers in </v>

28
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 2>manmade climate change like Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Shermer,</v>

29
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.653
<v Speaker 2>and Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as some of the more skeptical </v>

30
00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:32.980
<v Speaker 2>views such as Andrew Klavan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven crowder,</v>

31
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.050
<v Speaker 2>and Ben Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for the record,</v>

32
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:35.884
<v Speaker 2>not one of these guests believe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact same thing as anyone else I just </v>

33
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:40.060
<v Speaker 2>mentioned right there.</v>

34
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.703
<v Speaker 2>I find the climate change to be a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting discussion because it often </v>

35
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 2>shows how one's thinking works in other </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas as well.</v>

36
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats are those on the left.</v>

37
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.913
<v Speaker 2>See climate change as manmade and </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that governmental action is the </v>

38
00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:58.570
<v Speaker 2>best or in some cases the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse its negative effects.</v>

39
00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.763
<v Speaker 2>Republican's are those on the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally believe that something is </v>

40
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:03.334
<v Speaker 2>happening to the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Though there is some debate as to </v>

41
00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:06.034
<v Speaker 2>whether it's manmade but regardless </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed that the private sector is </v>

42
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:09.754
<v Speaker 2>better left to deal with these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course there are outliers on each </v>

43
00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:13.444
<v Speaker 2>side such as my former guests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California democratic gubernatorial </v>

44
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:19.030
<v Speaker 2>candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Shellenberger who wants the private</v>

45
00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:19.864
<v Speaker 2>sector to be more involved in solving </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate issues and at the same time </v>

46
00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:24.424
<v Speaker 2>there are also Republicans and people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right who deny manmade climate </v>

47
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:27.874
<v Speaker 2>change at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The science debate on climate change is </v>

48
00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:33.700
<v Speaker 2>an interesting one and one in which I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to have.</v>

49
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.773
<v Speaker 2>What interests me more though is how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government should or should not be part </v>

50
00:02:38.381 --> 00:02:40.840
<v Speaker 2>of the solution to whatever the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>may be.</v>

51
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.913
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my feelings on this that the government </v>

52
00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 2>is rarely the solution to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually at this point,</v>

53
00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:46.954
<v Speaker 2>I think the government is usually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem in the first place and I'd </v>

54
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:53.050
<v Speaker 2>always rather exhaust private options </v>
<v Speaker 2>before turning to the government,</v>

55
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.810
<v Speaker 2>especially the federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ironically,</v>

56
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 2>this should be the position of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who hate trump.</v>

57
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.063
<v Speaker 2>Would you want to keep giving the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government more power when you hate the </v>

58
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.674
<v Speaker 2>guy in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day it's not </v>

59
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 2>governmental power that they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with.</v>

60
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.863
<v Speaker 2>It's that they only have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>governmental power when it's not their </v>

61
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:11.614
<v Speaker 2>guy in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately there does seem to be a </v>

62
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:15.574
<v Speaker 2>younger generation that is tackling </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues like climate change in the </v>

63
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 2>environment in a totally new way.</v>

64
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.243
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be based not only in </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific facts but also in an </v>

65
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>understanding of how a limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>government should work.</v>

66
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.723
<v Speaker 2>My guest this week is Benji backer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>president of the American conservation </v>

67
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.194
<v Speaker 2>coalition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The group is dedicated to finding new </v>

68
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 2>ways to look at old problems as its </v>
<v Speaker 2>mantra states.</v>

69
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 2>They are committed to efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective,</v>

70
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 2>conservative environmentalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As for me,</v>

71
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm a believer in the science behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change and the funny thing about</v>

72
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 2>science is that it doesn't care whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe in it or not.</v>

73
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real debate around climate change is</v>

74
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 2>how to go about finding solutions </v>
<v Speaker 2>without giving more power and more money</v>

75
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:56.644
<v Speaker 2>to the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether you believe in climate science </v>

76
00:03:58.901 --> 00:03:59.734
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you want more government </v>

77
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.104
<v Speaker 2>regulation or less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whether you believe the private </v>

78
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:05.614
<v Speaker 2>sector can find a solution or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all stuck on this little rock </v>

79
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So until Elon Musk,</v>

80
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 2>a private businessman gets us all to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mars.</v>

81
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Let's try to figure out how to solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>some our problems on this pale blue dot.</v>

82
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 2>While we still have a chance.</v>

83
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.603
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

84
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Joining me today is the founder of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American Conservation Coalition,</v>

85
00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:30.374
<v Speaker 2>an organization committed to efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective conservative environmental </v>

86
00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:37.640
<v Speaker 2>ism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag Green Gop Benji backer,</v>

87
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 2>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great to be here.</v>

88
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I feel you are long overdue even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years old,</v>

89
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have a lot of time to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

90
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 2>but you got here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've met a couple times.</v>

91
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I kind of found out about you a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of years ago.</v>

92
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.903
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to talk about what kind of </v>

93
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:54.844
<v Speaker 2>put you on the map in the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and got your activism going and </v>

94
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

95
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's good to have you here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that you,</v>

96
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you dressed ready for the park?</v>

97
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.153
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta you gotta look good to feel </v>

98
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

99
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.390
<v Speaker 2>so you have a really interesting story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

100
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.470
<v Speaker 2>of what got you in this mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But first I just thought I'd like to ask</v>

101
00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:13.304
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess just kind of tell me a little </v>

102
00:05:13.671 --> 00:05:15.050
<v Speaker 2>bit about your upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

103
00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

104
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I grew up in a family of five,</v>

105
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.420
<v Speaker 3>a completely non political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

106
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 3>very close family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We traveled a lot together.</v>

107
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>youngest.</v>

108
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:26.040
<v Speaker 3>I had two older sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

109
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 3>my parents were actually entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started a business when I was,</v>

110
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 3>I want to say 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

111
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 3>which was a software company based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>mortgages.</v>

112
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:36.050
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

113
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.943
<v Speaker 3>it really started to take off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was during the recession and it </v>

114
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 3>was a really bold move for that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't really paid off and they're not</v>

115
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:45.430
<v Speaker 3>retired and kind of live the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>dream,</v>

116
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 3>which is a really cool thing to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought up by.</v>

117
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the politics at home where </v>

118
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 2>you guys always kind of conservative or </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't talk about it?</v>

119
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

120
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.100
<v Speaker 3>actually you've got really differing </v>
<v Speaker 3>views.</v>

121
00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 3>My sister is a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

122
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 3>one of them and then one of them is </v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

123
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just not into it very much.</v>

124
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my parents are conservative,</v>

125
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 3>but they never told us really about </v>
<v Speaker 3>their views.</v>

126
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 3>They wanted us to decide for ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously their morals and values,</v>

127
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 3>I think played into how I feel about </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

128
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.173
<v Speaker 3>but it was never forced upon us or they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were not adamant about politics or </v>

129
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:17.850
<v Speaker 3>volunteered or donated to my knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

130
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.703
<v Speaker 3>to campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I really wasn't talked about in the </v>

131
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:21.171
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

132
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 3>they'd have the debates on or they'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

133
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 3>you'd have the news on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing really more than that.</v>

134
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:26.564
<v Speaker 3>So I was able to figure out my opinions </v>
<v Speaker 3>for myself when I was a little bit </v>

135
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:32.220
<v Speaker 3>earlier than most people when I was 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

136
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of opinions does a 10 year old</v>

137
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 3>have?</v>

138
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.190
<v Speaker 3>While I was watching the John Mccain </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama debates,</v>

139
00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:39.790
<v Speaker 3>which 10 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

140
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.693
<v Speaker 3>at 10 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I found it really interesting and I </v>

141
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:44.504
<v Speaker 3>wanted to figure out where I stood on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the spectrum of what I support John </v>

142
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 3>Mccain or would I support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

143
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 3>I think Senator Obama at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I looked up online,</v>

144
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:54.764
<v Speaker 3>kind of just a basic outline of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>each side believed in and I figured out </v>

145
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 3>that I was conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

146
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.320
<v Speaker 3>and so for the last couple of years I </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>

147
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 3>I forced my parents to put signs in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>yard for John Mccain.</v>

148
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 3>I forced them to put bumper stickers on </v>
<v Speaker 3>our cars.</v>

149
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 3>I've [inaudible] what did your parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about this?</v>

150
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.380
<v Speaker 3>They're tenured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

151
00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll support you in whatever you do.</v>

152
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were very,</v>

153
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

154
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I think that they were surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

155
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:21.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

156
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.623
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if any parent thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are 10 year old kid is going to </v>

157
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:29.200
<v Speaker 3>get super interested in politics because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really affect you at 10 years</v>

158
00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:30.910
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really affect you until after</v>

159
00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:31.840
<v Speaker 3>college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

160
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was kind of a surprise to them,</v>

161
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:37.060
<v Speaker 3>but they were supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They let me,</v>

162
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:37.894
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>research as much as I wanted to and </v>

163
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:39.460
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

164
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:41.380
<v Speaker 3>they allowed me to put the signs in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>yard,</v>

165
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bumper stickers on my ripstik,</v>

166
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing.</v>

167
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.240
<v Speaker 3>So it was a pretty cool time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I got injured,</v>

168
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.163
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and decided to volunteer because I </v>

169
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.200
<v Speaker 3>couldn't play sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want to get to that in a sec.</v>

170
00:07:55.201 --> 00:07:56.034
<v Speaker 3>But wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want a picture of this 10 years </v>

171
00:07:56.701 --> 00:07:57.491
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were watching it,</v>

172
00:07:57.491 --> 00:07:59.280
<v Speaker 3>but I assume you were watching with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks probably.</v>

173
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.463
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

174
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.493
<v Speaker 3>You go online to figure out the issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What mattered to you at 10 years old </v>

175
00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:06.060
<v Speaker 3>that you said at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

176
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm a conservative or I'm going to vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>for Mccain.</v>

177
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my pa,</v>

178
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:10.443
<v Speaker 3>my parents were always really fiscally </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative was just how they spent </v>

179
00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:14.400
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

180
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.243
<v Speaker 3>we were never like in a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really tough position when I was super </v>

181
00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.320
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we always were saying,</v>

182
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy the cheapest product you can save as</v>

183
00:08:24.761 --> 00:08:25.594
<v Speaker 3>much money as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was something that I was </v>

184
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:28.780
<v Speaker 3>brought up with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that really mattered to me.</v>

185
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.883
<v Speaker 3>And knowing that the government could </v>
<v Speaker 3>take away my parents hard earned money </v>

186
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.323
<v Speaker 3>and knowing that the government could </v>
<v Speaker 3>come in and harm my dad's business by </v>

187
00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:41.710
<v Speaker 3>putting a ton of restrictions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of struck me pretty harshly.</v>

188
00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:45.070
<v Speaker 3>And then also my family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were raised on family values,</v>

189
00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

190
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.500
<v Speaker 3>close knit family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

191
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:48.423
<v Speaker 3>it kind of happens that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those two things were kind of the </v>

192
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 3>main drivers I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

193
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.490
<v Speaker 3>it's just hard to imagine a 10 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

194
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty cool</v>

195
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 2>and it explains why you're here right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

196
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:58.524
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

197
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.423
<v Speaker 2>we'll put you on the map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I found out about you and I </v>

198
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:01.944
<v Speaker 2>think nationally when people found out </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you and now this makes sense now </v>

199
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:06.770
<v Speaker 2>that I know that this was brewing at 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

200
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.030
<v Speaker 2>2013 you're 15 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

201
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.083
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

202
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.033
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had been active in politics for </v>

203
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.920
<v Speaker 3>three years before that.</v>

204
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.620
<v Speaker 2>And what does that even mean?</v>

205
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.880
<v Speaker 3>Volunteering on Scott Walker's campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Senator Ron Johnson's campaign,</v>

206
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I helped out a Mitt Romney as well in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2012 and</v>

207
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.303
<v Speaker 2>believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry to draw up a could people even </v>

208
00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:31.340
<v Speaker 2>believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like here's this 12 year old kid,</v>

209
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.530
<v Speaker 2>11 year old kid working on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras.</v>

210
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.443
<v Speaker 3>It's actually really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first campaign ever worked on did </v>

211
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:39.140
<v Speaker 3>let me use the phones at first because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>

212
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.120
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking to a 12 year old on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the phone,</v>

213
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.490
<v Speaker 3>you can tell it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hi is Michael?</v>

214
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.620
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

215
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.513
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like who are you and why are you 12 </v>

216
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.960
<v Speaker 3>and why are you calling me from </v>
<v Speaker 3>congressional office?</v>

217
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Regressional campaign.</v>

218
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.250
<v Speaker 3>And so people were actually really </v>
<v Speaker 3>surprised.</v>

219
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Conservatives were really supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

220
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.003
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this 12 year old kid is </v>

221
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.400
<v Speaker 3>volunteering for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on the left is like,</v>

222
00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:04.040
<v Speaker 3>why is this 12 year old kid volunteering</v>
<v Speaker 3>for them?</v>

223
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was pretty funny.</v>

224
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.953
<v Speaker 3>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was injured so I needed something to </v>

225
00:10:08.031 --> 00:10:09.470
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like any 12 year old,</v>

226
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.080
<v Speaker 3>I decided to volunteer for politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

227
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 3>very normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

228
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.260
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a very interesting dynamic</v>

229
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.850
<v Speaker 2>because this is also hilarious that an </v>
<v Speaker 2>injury got you into politics.</v>

230
00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 2>What were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of injury?</v>

231
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.893
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an ankle injury that the doctors </v>

232
00:10:23.021 --> 00:10:25.240
<v Speaker 3>couldn't figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on crutches for a year and a half.</v>

233
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

234
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.820
<v Speaker 3>gained a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

235
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.713
<v Speaker 3>it was during middle school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which does not help because those were </v>

236
00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:32.410
<v Speaker 3>the worst years for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>

237
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then again,</v>

238
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.200
<v Speaker 3>I went into congressional office and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want me to do the phones.</v>

239
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:39.034
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want me to go door to door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause imagine a 12 year old coming to </v>

240
00:10:40.691 --> 00:10:41.650
<v Speaker 3>your door and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

241
00:10:41.651 --> 00:10:44.300
<v Speaker 3>you should vote for x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Y or Z.</v>

242
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

243
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.510
<v Speaker 3>why am I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should I trust the 12 year old?</v>

244
00:10:46.511 --> 00:10:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

245
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.503
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a very interesting dynamic at </v>

246
00:10:49.271 --> 00:10:50.104
<v Speaker 3>that age.</v>

247
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:50.941
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

248
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 2>so now what puts you on the map?</v>
<v Speaker 2>2013,</v>

249
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:54.860
<v Speaker 2>you're 15 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something happened.</v>

250
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

251
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in high school,</v>

252
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.550
<v Speaker 3>early on in high school and middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>school teachers had really come after me</v>

253
00:11:01.551 --> 00:11:02.384
<v Speaker 3>for my political views because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make local headlines for my </v>

254
00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:07.250
<v Speaker 3>activism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the recall election,</v>

255
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Scott Walker in 2012.</v>

256
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

257
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.193
<v Speaker 2>tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me a little bit about what your </v>

258
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:14.090
<v Speaker 2>opinions were in what your teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

259
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was really pro Scott Walker guy.</v>

260
00:11:17.081 --> 00:11:17.914
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually ended up becoming close with </v>

261
00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:22.270
<v Speaker 3>his family and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a great guy,</v>

262
00:11:22.271 --> 00:11:24.700
<v Speaker 3>but I even better policies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

263
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.593
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to a lot of teachers who were </v>

264
00:11:26.111 --> 00:11:30.670
<v Speaker 3>sick of being forced to join unions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sake of starting out with $30,000</v>

265
00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:35.020
<v Speaker 3>base pay when senior senior teachers </v>
<v Speaker 3>were making $100,000</v>

266
00:11:35.021 --> 00:11:37.990
<v Speaker 3>with benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it took them 40 years to get to that</v>

267
00:11:37.991 --> 00:11:39.550
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they a better teacher.</v>

268
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.643
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people were really kind of sick of </v>

269
00:11:41.411 --> 00:11:42.750
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

270
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.743
<v Speaker 3>but it was a very small minority because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unions really had a lot of </v>

271
00:11:46.031 --> 00:11:48.940
<v Speaker 3>brainwashing in the state and I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>in other states as well.</v>

272
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.043
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so my view is that Scott Walker was </v>

273
00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:52.474
<v Speaker 3>really helping out the state cause he </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance the budget and he's kind of </v>

274
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 3>freed the teachers up and help their pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>become more of a fair shake.</v>

275
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

276
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 3>the teachers did not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The majority of them,</v>

277
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:03.034
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people know of the huge uprising </v>

278
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.500
<v Speaker 3>that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the protest,</v>

279
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands of people at death</v>
<v Speaker 3>threats to every Republican in the state</v>

280
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 3>legislature and the governor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

281
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.870
<v Speaker 3>and so the teachers would leave school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

282
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 3>they protested and they'd take leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would cry in class.</v>

283
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

284
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

285
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

286
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 3>you have me over here bold little </v>
<v Speaker 3>Benji's going out there and saying,</v>

287
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rah Rah Scott Walker.</v>

288
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.473
<v Speaker 3>They did not like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would say pretty disparaging </v>

289
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.280
<v Speaker 3>things to be in class in front of my,</v>

290
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.280
<v Speaker 2>like what kinds of things would they say</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you?</v>

291
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:36.563
<v Speaker 3>My family for being business owners and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that they were lazy and saying </v>

292
00:12:40.261 --> 00:12:41.094
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

293
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

294
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 3>They assume that my parents golf every </v>
<v Speaker 3>Friday,</v>

295
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents don't know how to golf,</v>

296
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:50.800
<v Speaker 3>so that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how to golf.</v>

297
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.020
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was,</v>

298
00:12:53.021 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 3>that was one thing that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they would always say and um,</v>

299
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 3>they would call me a racist or weird for</v>
<v Speaker 3>being in politics at such a young age.</v>

300
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.320
<v Speaker 2>What's that like for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a kid of that age to be dealing with</v>

301
00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:05.700
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing to be outspoken,</v>

302
00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:09.420
<v Speaker 2>but right now your teacher is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your authority figures are attacking you</v>

303
00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:11.700
<v Speaker 2>publicly in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine right</v>

304
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.593
<v Speaker 3>then me because at first I was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken aback and I was kind of sad about </v>

305
00:13:16.651 --> 00:13:17.350
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

306
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.110
<v Speaker 3>but my parents really pushed me on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

307
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.040
<v Speaker 3>you're doing the right thing and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of block out as the,</v>

308
00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:24.960
<v Speaker 3>as the millennials say blackout the </v>
<v Speaker 3>haters.</v>

309
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

310
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.850
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't really care that much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>long as it didn't affect my grades,</v>

311
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:30.803
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or how my classmates viewed me cause I </v>

312
00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:35.640
<v Speaker 3>do care about the people that I am </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with.</v>

313
00:13:35.641 --> 00:13:36.690
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

314
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:40.590
<v Speaker 3>so that was kind of frustrating but </v>
<v Speaker 3>after awhile it just kind of got used to</v>

315
00:13:40.591 --> 00:13:41.424
<v Speaker 3>it because it would happen in a class </v>
<v Speaker 3>every single quarter of every single </v>

316
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:45.923
<v Speaker 3>semester of every single year from </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventh grade until till I started </v>

317
00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:51.150
<v Speaker 3>coming out nationally about this issue.</v>

318
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.113
<v Speaker 2>Did it ever affect your grades?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I could see a teacher in a </v>

319
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:54.874
<v Speaker 2>subjective class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not math where it would be tough </v>

320
00:13:56.441 --> 00:13:57.274
<v Speaker 2>to screw with your grades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a social studies teacher where </v>

321
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:00.424
<v Speaker 2>you're writing an essay or an English </v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher or something actually harming </v>

322
00:14:02.621 --> 00:14:02.850
<v Speaker 2>your grade,</v>

323
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.170
<v Speaker 3>it did actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

324
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.200
<v Speaker 3>my lowest grade ever was in a social </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies class in middle school.</v>

325
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.173
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never gotten anything really below </v>

326
00:14:12.271 --> 00:14:16.690
<v Speaker 3>like a high b level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there I got a s a d plus and wow.</v>

327
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.370
<v Speaker 3>And that social studies class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's middle school.</v>

328
00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:23.520
<v Speaker 3>So at that point it was middle school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it didn't really matter,</v>

329
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>per se.</v>

330
00:14:24.841 --> 00:14:25.674
<v Speaker 3>But you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see that there is a trend going </v>

331
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:30.570
<v Speaker 3>and that I'd be worried in future years </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not that it would affect me.</v>

332
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.140
<v Speaker 3>And in other classes I don't think it </v>
<v Speaker 3>did as much,</v>

333
00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:36.620
<v Speaker 3>which is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in that class I did see,</v>

334
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.473
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a pretty obvious correlation</v>
<v Speaker 3>between me getting good grades in every </v>

335
00:14:40.651 --> 00:14:41.484
<v Speaker 3>class since that and every class before </v>
<v Speaker 3>then and then getting a d plus in that </v>

336
00:14:44.311 --> 00:14:45.230
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was kind of weird.</v>

337
00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

338
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.203
<v Speaker 2>And also probably not a coincidence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>social studies is the class that you </v>

339
00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Speaker 2>were probably talking about this right </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most.</v>

340
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>

341
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 2>did you try to fight the teacher on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

342
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Did your folks get involved or anything?</v>

343
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.041
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually,</v>

344
00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:55.780
<v Speaker 3>I actually ended up switching schools.</v>

345
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:56.871
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

346
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:57.570
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

347
00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:58.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

348
00:14:58.261 --> 00:15:00.030
<v Speaker 3>so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a big change.</v>

349
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I'd actually ended up being for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>better because,</v>

350
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the school I switched to is the one,</v>

351
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.060
<v Speaker 3>the feeder school to the high school </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was going to.</v>

352
00:15:06.061 --> 00:15:08.160
<v Speaker 3>So I ended up making better connections </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

353
00:15:08.161 --> 00:15:09.150
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

354
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.510
<v Speaker 3>it was an annoying change that shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been necessary.</v>

355
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.633
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was a teacher who had a history </v>

356
00:15:14.731 --> 00:15:15.564
<v Speaker 3>of these types of behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just on politics but on other </v>

357
00:15:17.161 --> 00:15:17.994
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

358
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:18.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

359
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.540
<v Speaker 2>so it's interesting because you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting the unions,</v>

360
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:22.403
<v Speaker 2>which in your estimation was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>pro teacher because you felt the unions </v>

361
00:15:25.561 --> 00:15:28.080
<v Speaker 2>were too powerful and meanwhile you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers fighting you,</v>

362
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.123
<v Speaker 2>which is really only feeding your </v>
<v Speaker 2>initial premise right in the first </v>

363
00:15:31.471 --> 00:15:32.050
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

364
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was real,</v>

365
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.030
<v Speaker 3>it really enhanced my opinion on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject.</v>

366
00:15:37.031 --> 00:15:37.864
<v Speaker 3>It made me really want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to push further because I could tell </v>

367
00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:41.374
<v Speaker 3>that some of these teachers were really </v>
<v Speaker 3>worried about their job or their job </v>

368
00:15:44.741 --> 00:15:47.710
<v Speaker 3>security because they knew that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could actually be held accountable now.</v>

369
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.380
<v Speaker 3>And some of the senior teachers knew </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

370
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.273
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually have to perform well to get </v>

371
00:15:52.211 --> 00:15:53.044
<v Speaker 3>paid well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't am my age isn't just the </v>

372
00:15:55.151 --> 00:15:56.380
<v Speaker 3>deciding factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

373
00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.480
<v Speaker 3>So I think that that's why people came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out so strongly in certain areas.</v>

374
00:16:01.481 --> 00:16:02.314
<v Speaker 3>So some people just didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the full scope of the </v>

375
00:16:04.151 --> 00:16:06.880
<v Speaker 3>situation and calm him down once they </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured that out.</v>

376
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:07.893
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think we're really worried about </v>

377
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.563
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their future pay because they had kind </v>

378
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:14.010
<v Speaker 3>of just been relaxed for the last 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years since their pay had gone up.</v>

379
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.013
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically they weren't doing a great </v>

380
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:16.570
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

381
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just unique to Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is happening all over America where</v>

382
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:21.740
<v Speaker 2>you have these teachers that have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>at it forever.</v>

383
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of given up or not working </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hard anymore,</v>

384
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 2>but they're protected by the unions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their salaries keep going up,</v>

385
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:28.250
<v Speaker 2>they get great benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

386
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.103
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're fighting and you're </v>

387
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:33.920
<v Speaker 2>seeing the fruits of what happens with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as they're cracking down on you.</v>

388
00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:37.200
<v Speaker 2>So what actually put you on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the specific incident that,</v>

389
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.810
<v Speaker 2>that put this all in motion.</v>

390
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.673
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of took all the information </v>

391
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:43.214
<v Speaker 3>that I had of all the experiences that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had gone through and wrote it up in a </v>

392
00:16:46.341 --> 00:16:48.490
<v Speaker 3>blog for freedom works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

393
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.470
<v Speaker 3>it ended up going to drudge and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

394
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 3>todd starnes at Fox wrote something up </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

395
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.770
<v Speaker 3>Town hall had something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It started to get in that space and then</v>

396
00:16:57.771 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 3>eventually Megan Kelly's show reached </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

397
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to ask me to come on and talk about it.</v>

398
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.133
<v Speaker 3>So that kind of put me on the map there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I started to be invited to </v>

399
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:06.763
<v Speaker 3>conferences to speak about my experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kind of how other young </v>

400
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:13.250
<v Speaker 3>conservatives shouldn't be scared to </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak out in the classroom even if their</v>

401
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 3>teachers or other fellow students come </v>
<v Speaker 3>after them.</v>

402
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:16.643
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't easy because it was my </v>

403
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:19.574
<v Speaker 3>sophomore year of high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually my fresh end of my freshman </v>

404
00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:24.080
<v Speaker 3>year of high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

405
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 3>after that Fox News interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I received death threats.</v>

406
00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:27.734
<v Speaker 3>People were threatening me at school </v>
<v Speaker 3>because some of the teachers that I had </v>

407
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.570
<v Speaker 3>called out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'd never named their names,</v>

408
00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 3>but I called them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

409
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 3>they were popular with the students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

410
00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:40.790
<v Speaker 3>so people weren't happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

411
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.610
<v Speaker 3>it was not an easy time for my family </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

412
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to focus on that a little bit.</v>

413
00:17:45.421 --> 00:17:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think cause everyone gets this </v>
<v Speaker 2>these days.</v>

414
00:17:47.851 --> 00:17:48.684
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is one of the themes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we do here is everyone's just like </v>

415
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 2>afraid to say anything because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to deal.</v>

416
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.930
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to deal with just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate they get on twitter.</v>

417
00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 2>And you've got plenty of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I found you after this.</v>

418
00:17:57.241 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other stuff,</v>

419
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:00.570
<v Speaker 2>like you had to go to school the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

420
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 2>So literally what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that like?</v>

421
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:03.611
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

422
00:18:03.611 --> 00:18:04.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I've ever said this </v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly,</v>

423
00:18:04.911 --> 00:18:07.940
<v Speaker 3>but I carry a knife to school cause I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was so scared,</v>

424
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my life.</v>

425
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.123
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't tell my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend give it to me that was </v>

426
00:18:13.011 --> 00:18:14.680
<v Speaker 3>worried about my safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

427
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.240
<v Speaker 3>it was a pretty hard time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

428
00:18:17.241 --> 00:18:20.090
<v Speaker 3>because no matter if people think I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something right or wrong,</v>

429
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.010
<v Speaker 3>I think part of the problem with our </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

430
00:18:22.011 --> 00:18:24.350
<v Speaker 3>and it was the same way four years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>or five years ago,</v>

431
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.930
<v Speaker 3>is that if someone's doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't agree with,</v>

432
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.860
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to completely attack </v>
<v Speaker 3>them wholeheartedly without any,</v>

433
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.943
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect for what they're doing or their </v>

434
00:18:33.171 --> 00:18:34.004
<v Speaker 3>opinions or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was honestly scared for my </v>

435
00:18:37.521 --> 00:18:38.180
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

436
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.013
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my bike stolen when I biked to an </v>

437
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:41.744
<v Speaker 3>ice cream shop and I live in a very safe</v>
<v Speaker 3>place and it was somebody from my high </v>

438
00:18:44.571 --> 00:18:46.370
<v Speaker 3>school that just really didn't like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

439
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.493
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be walking my dogs and some would </v>

440
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.170
<v Speaker 3>flip me off and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after you Benji backer,</v>

441
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suck a whatever.</v>

442
00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.093
<v Speaker 2>What about your family at that time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I know you said your folks were </v>

443
00:18:55.481 --> 00:18:57.010
<v Speaker 2>always backing you and telling you what </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

444
00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:57.844
<v Speaker 2>what you believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there any repercussions for them or </v>

445
00:18:59.591 --> 00:19:00.910
<v Speaker 2>their business or anything like that?</v>

446
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.851
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

447
00:19:01.851 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 3>their business was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

448
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:04.044
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

449
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.380
<v Speaker 3>most adults who knew what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>treating me with a lot of respect.</v>

450
00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:09.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it was mostly the young people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

451
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.430
<v Speaker 3>who were a little bit ignorant about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what was going on.</v>

452
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.593
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my parents didn't have any negative </v>

453
00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:15.780
<v Speaker 3>repercussions that I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

454
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:16.614
<v Speaker 3>I might've been not telling me because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want to make it any worse </v>

455
00:19:19.081 --> 00:19:20.670
<v Speaker 3>for me cause I got all that I care about</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

456
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.150
<v Speaker 3>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a tough time for them though,</v>

457
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.180
<v Speaker 3>because they live through their kids and</v>
<v Speaker 3>having something like that be constantly</v>

458
00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:31.030
<v Speaker 3>going after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

459
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.963
<v Speaker 3>are people constantly going after your </v>
<v Speaker 3>son is not the greatest thing in the </v>

460
00:19:34.771 --> 00:19:35.604
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when they know that what </v>

461
00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:36.924
<v Speaker 3>you're doing is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were kind of my biggest </v>

462
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:42.660
<v Speaker 3>supporters at the time telling me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep pushing on and um,</v>

463
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

464
00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:44.694
<v Speaker 3>block out the haters and just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do what you think is right because </v>

465
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.100
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are gonna realize it eventually.</v>

466
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.203
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had tons of people come after or </v>

467
00:19:52.561 --> 00:19:54.930
<v Speaker 3>come up to me a years afterwards and </v>
<v Speaker 3>apologize,</v>

468
00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.013
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and realize that what they did was </v>

469
00:19:56.941 --> 00:19:58.210
<v Speaker 3>immature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

470
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.020
<v Speaker 3>people who said the worst things to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>or told me to kill myself or whatever,</v>

471
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:02.370
<v Speaker 3>those people would come up to me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

472
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm really sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

473
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.123
<v Speaker 3>because as people mature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start to realize that that's not </v>

474
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.260
<v Speaker 3>okay dialogue even if you totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with someone.</v>

475
00:20:10.261 --> 00:20:10.730
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

476
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:11.563
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadly we have a lot of people who don't </v>

477
00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:15.260
<v Speaker 2>mature these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is nice to hear though.</v>

478
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.060
<v Speaker 2>What about the support you got from your</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends?</v>

479
00:20:17.061 --> 00:20:17.894
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where your,</v>

480
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.823
<v Speaker 2>where your friends that supported you </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to publicly support you because </v>

481
00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:22.820
<v Speaker 2>that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that's another,</v>

482
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.140
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain things.</v>

483
00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:25.550
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think this is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

484
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.590
<v Speaker 2>There are certain trends with all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

485
00:20:27.591 --> 00:20:28.424
<v Speaker 2>whether it's you taking an unpopular but</v>
<v Speaker 2>principal position or it's a guy like </v>

486
00:20:31.521 --> 00:20:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Bret Weinstein at Evergreen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

487
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Just all these different people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out come out.</v>

488
00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a coming out in a way that the same</v>

489
00:20:39.261 --> 00:20:41.540
<v Speaker 2>tactics happen every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in this case,</v>

490
00:20:41.541 --> 00:20:44.630
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you're your friends or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever won't back you publicly,</v>

491
00:20:44.631 --> 00:20:47.110
<v Speaker 2>but privately probably had no problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

492
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had friends who</v>

493
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.823
<v Speaker 2>came up to me or text me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I support you and I feel terrible for </v>

494
00:20:52.911 --> 00:20:55.250
<v Speaker 2>what you're going through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't associate myself with you.</v>

495
00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.383
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those friends ended up trying to </v>

496
00:20:58.821 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 2>associate it with me later on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way though,</v>

497
00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.820
<v Speaker 2>those are the worst ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

498
00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like if someone just tells me</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go after yourself,</v>

499
00:21:05.311 --> 00:21:06.750
<v Speaker 2>it's like big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

500
00:21:06.751 --> 00:21:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the friends,</v>

501
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:09.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I your shield?</v>

502
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.243
<v Speaker 2>You know what it'd be like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I the guy that's supposed to just be </v>

503
00:21:12.751 --> 00:21:15.510
<v Speaker 2>out there while you sit quietly and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing?</v>

504
00:21:15.511 --> 00:21:16.340
<v Speaker 2>You're not helping me.</v>

505
00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:16.911
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

506
00:21:16.911 --> 00:21:20.720
<v Speaker 3>I had one really good friend named </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brandon who supported me through it all.</v>

507
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and would come over every,</v>

508
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.003
<v Speaker 3>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this death threat stuff started to </v>

509
00:21:25.281 --> 00:21:27.740
<v Speaker 3>happen right as summer started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

510
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.690
<v Speaker 3>which was the worst time is in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school as a freshman,</v>

511
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.450
<v Speaker 3>you're not really doing anything during </v>
<v Speaker 3>the summer,</v>

512
00:21:32.451 --> 00:21:34.730
<v Speaker 3>so you're just like at home sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at your twitter thing.</v>

513
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people want to kill me,</v>

514
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.540
<v Speaker 3>or they think I'm the worst person in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

515
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.540
<v Speaker 3>So it's really nice to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

516
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:42.350
<v Speaker 3>one friend who I could rely on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

517
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.450
<v Speaker 3>plus my family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

518
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.520
<v Speaker 3>And I actually took a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>break from the town that I lived in.</v>

519
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad even said,</v>

520
00:21:47.961 --> 00:21:50.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things got worse that we could move,</v>

521
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that was necessary,</v>

522
00:21:52.431 --> 00:21:55.100
<v Speaker 3>which I never thought it was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary and it never was.</v>

523
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.193
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I took a little bit of a break and </v>

524
00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.470
<v Speaker 3>went to my grandparents' house for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile just to get away from it all.</v>

525
00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.573
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there was one time actually at </v>

526
00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:04.030
<v Speaker 3>my house when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

527
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:04.864
<v Speaker 3>the two times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once when someone called and said they </v>

528
00:22:06.141 --> 00:22:07.520
<v Speaker 3>were going to come to my house and kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

529
00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.860
<v Speaker 3>I had an anonymous line to my home </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

530
00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.580
<v Speaker 3>And then a second time when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

531
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 3>I was watching a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

532
00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.773
<v Speaker 3>and it's actually Ted and I was trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to like have a fun night after all this </v>

533
00:22:22.071 --> 00:22:24.900
<v Speaker 3>stuff had been going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the uh,</v>

534
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.053
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone knocked on the window and was </v>

535
00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:29.810
<v Speaker 3>like flipping me off and it was like in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the night is I was sitting</v>

536
00:22:29.811 --> 00:22:33.380
<v Speaker 3>in my living room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was pretty scared to be at home for</v>

537
00:22:33.381 --> 00:22:35.670
<v Speaker 3>a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I went away for a little bit.</v>

538
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting cause I don't want </v>

539
00:22:37.371 --> 00:22:39.810
<v Speaker 2>to Belabor the point with you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of other rice,</v>

540
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.980
<v Speaker 2>the important stuff I want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

541
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.833
<v Speaker 2>but I think that it's worth mentioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because so many people go through </v>

542
00:22:45.621 --> 00:22:46.454
<v Speaker 2>this and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on the other side now you made </v>

543
00:22:48.411 --> 00:22:50.810
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing cool stuff and you survived</v>

544
00:22:50.811 --> 00:22:53.360
<v Speaker 2>and it's just worth showing people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

545
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.310
<v Speaker 2>most usually you will survive.</v>

546
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

547
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.653
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was really big for me is that it </v>

548
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.750
<v Speaker 3>takes a strong person to go through </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

549
00:23:00.751 --> 00:23:04.260
<v Speaker 3>But there are tons of people going </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the exact same thing nationwide.</v>

550
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.570
<v Speaker 3>And I wouldn't even say that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people on the left side,</v>

551
00:23:06.571 --> 00:23:09.210
<v Speaker 3>he'd go through the exact same thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not just,</v>

552
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.000
<v Speaker 3>it's not just people on the left who </v>
<v Speaker 3>have this nasty attitude.</v>

553
00:23:12.001 --> 00:23:15.270
<v Speaker 3>It's people on the right as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's,</v>

554
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.840
<v Speaker 3>it's sickening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

555
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.050
<v Speaker 3>because even if you disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone wholeheartedly,</v>

556
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just stay quiet if you really,</v>

557
00:23:21.271 --> 00:23:25.200
<v Speaker 3>if you really are going to be that rude </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that upset about it,</v>

558
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.453
<v Speaker 3>be respectful and be quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of how I would like to do </v>

559
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.393
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think to other people who are </v>

560
00:23:31.171 --> 00:23:32.004
<v Speaker 3>in similar situations persevering </v>
<v Speaker 3>through this is the best thing that you </v>

561
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:35.820
<v Speaker 3>can go through.</v>

562
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.111
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

563
00:23:36.111 --> 00:23:39.280
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I matured into a 45 or 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>year old,</v>

564
00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:43.920
<v Speaker 3>but I was like 14 or 15 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was able to really progress in.</v>

565
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.343
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it actually might be one of the </v>

566
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:47.833
<v Speaker 3>best experiences of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it was the one of the worst </v>

567
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:52.880
<v Speaker 3>experiences of my life in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>furthering myself.</v>

568
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also think,</v>

569
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:55.663
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just knowing that if I can persevere </v>

570
00:23:57.351 --> 00:24:00.560
<v Speaker 3>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone can and anyone should,</v>

571
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.040
<v Speaker 3>and standing up for your viewpoints </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't going to be easy,</v>

572
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:05.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's totally worth it.</v>

573
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Well said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

574
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I think we talked about this while we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had lunch a couple of weeks ago.</v>

575
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we talked about this,</v>

576
00:24:10.161 --> 00:24:10.994
<v Speaker 2>but I told you that I think my best </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional moment is also my worst </v>

577
00:24:13.671 --> 00:24:14.504
<v Speaker 2>professional moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was when Larry elder just </v>

578
00:24:16.131 --> 00:24:16.964
<v Speaker 2>bludging be over the head with facts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was my worst because I wasn't </v>

579
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:23.030
<v Speaker 2>prepared and it was my best because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened me up and then I was like,</v>

580
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new information,</v>

581
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 2>new facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

582
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.350
<v Speaker 2>let's explore that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

583
00:24:27.351 --> 00:24:27.921
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

584
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:29.660
<v Speaker 2>getting through something is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

585
00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm comparing that moment with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry to everything that you,</v>

586
00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.313
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what I've found is that it </v>

587
00:24:35.791 --> 00:24:36.624
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I did open up the eyes of a lot of </v>

588
00:24:38.551 --> 00:24:39.840
<v Speaker 3>the people who attacked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

589
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:44.970
<v Speaker 3>They event eventually apologized and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they went to attack me and apologized,</v>

590
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.220
<v Speaker 3>they went to open their minds either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

591
00:24:47.221 --> 00:24:48.960
<v Speaker 3>a couple of years later they're probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking back like,</v>

592
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:49.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

593
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.693
<v Speaker 3>that was really terrible of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But would they ever have thought about </v>

594
00:24:53.431 --> 00:24:55.020
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that wouldn't have happened,</v>

595
00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.970
<v Speaker 3>they might've done the same thing five </v>
<v Speaker 3>years later,</v>

596
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.100
<v Speaker 3>which would be way worse than doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in high school.</v>

597
00:24:59.101 --> 00:25:01.290
<v Speaker 3>So I think that going through those </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>

598
00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:03.780
<v Speaker 3>no matter what side you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is better.</v>

599
00:25:03.781 --> 00:25:05.640
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think that it should happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does.</v>

600
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.750
<v Speaker 3>It does help you persevere.</v>

601
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that moment puts you on the map.</v>

602
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

603
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I started following you on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every,</v>

604
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.070
<v Speaker 2>all these people are following you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're suddenly,</v>

605
00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:15.170
<v Speaker 2>your voice is being heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

606
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.970
<v Speaker 2>where you immediately involved in more </v>
<v Speaker 2>activism after that or I,</v>

607
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.073
<v Speaker 2>cause then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had an interesting phase of like </v>

608
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.303
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could tell you were like very </v>

609
00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:23.684
<v Speaker 2>frustrated with politics at times and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were pissed at your own side a lot </v>

610
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:28.720
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

611
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.460
<v Speaker 2>and trump and all of that flashing </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward a little bit later.</v>

612
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:32.361
<v Speaker 2>But what we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

613
00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:34.300
<v Speaker 2>what was the next step?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just get us to,</v>

614
00:25:34.301 --> 00:25:35.270
<v Speaker 2>to where you're at now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

615
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.820
<v Speaker 3>I dealt with so much negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

616
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.630
<v Speaker 3>political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

617
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.513
<v Speaker 3>experiences that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many negative political experiences </v>

618
00:25:43.591 --> 00:25:46.110
<v Speaker 3>that I wanted to do something positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

619
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.960
<v Speaker 3>and I was sick of the partisan bickering</v>
<v Speaker 3>on both sides.</v>

620
00:25:48.961 --> 00:25:49.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

621
00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.990
<v Speaker 3>I have not really changed any of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>beliefs.</v>

622
00:25:51.991 --> 00:25:52.824
<v Speaker 3>I think both sides have just gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>further and further away from the </v>

623
00:25:54.931 --> 00:25:56.220
<v Speaker 3>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is frustrating.</v>

624
00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I actually took a year hiatus in high</v>

625
00:25:59.101 --> 00:26:00.460
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

626
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:01.463
<v Speaker 3>my senior year just to enjoy school and </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy my friends and kind of graduate </v>

627
00:26:05.221 --> 00:26:06.000
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

628
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.833
<v Speaker 3>with a fun last experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I couldn't really stay away as long </v>

629
00:26:10.051 --> 00:26:10.884
<v Speaker 3>as I had hoped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking that I could probably </v>

630
00:26:12.031 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 3>stay away through college as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

631
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:15.623
<v Speaker 3>but I had seen so many negative things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there needed to be something done </v>

632
00:26:18.421 --> 00:26:21.300
<v Speaker 3>that was positive and I was so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

633
00:26:21.301 --> 00:26:22.134
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like get the partisan bickering </v>

634
00:26:22.771 --> 00:26:23.604
<v Speaker 3>that I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get involved in something that would </v>

635
00:26:25.591 --> 00:26:28.920
<v Speaker 3>benefit society and have a decent </v>
<v Speaker 3>dialogue,</v>

636
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wouldn't generate complete hate from</v>

637
00:26:31.741 --> 00:26:34.200
<v Speaker 3>both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that we need more of that in</v>

638
00:26:34.201 --> 00:26:35.940
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a decent dialogue.</v>

639
00:26:35.941 --> 00:26:38.070
<v Speaker 3>And if it has to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to happen on an easy intro,</v>

640
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.730
<v Speaker 3>a issue like the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what I focus on then so be it.</v>

641
00:26:41.731 --> 00:26:46.500
<v Speaker 3>But I would hope that that could over to</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hotly contested issues too,</v>

642
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:48.840
<v Speaker 3>like gun control or immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

643
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

644
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.171
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

645
00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:53.650
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that actually talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the environment can be perhaps the</v>

646
00:26:53.651 --> 00:26:58.540
<v Speaker 2>most hotly contested anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime I've done anything on climate on</v>

647
00:26:58.541 --> 00:26:59.374
<v Speaker 2>this show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of hate is bananas on both </v>

648
00:27:01.511 --> 00:27:01.921
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

649
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:03.550
<v Speaker 2>So each,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it shouldn't be right.</v>

650
00:27:03.551 --> 00:27:04.384
<v Speaker 2>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are all living on this planet earth </v>

651
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.210
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we probably all care about it.</v>

652
00:27:07.211 --> 00:27:08.090
<v Speaker 2>At least I hope or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

653
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:08.933
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of what you think is the </v>

654
00:27:10.391 --> 00:27:11.470
<v Speaker 2>best way to care about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>

655
00:27:11.471 --> 00:27:12.580
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to get all your,</v>

656
00:27:12.581 --> 00:27:13.930
<v Speaker 2>you're working on that and just not</v>

657
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.430
<v Speaker 3>should be about is how we all care about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

658
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.140
<v Speaker 3>but let's talk about the different </v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions.</v>

659
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:18.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

660
00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 2>So before we get to the solutions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing now.</v>

661
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

662
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I think when people see a young </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>

663
00:27:24.981 --> 00:27:25.814
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still a piece of them that they </v>

664
00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:27.654
<v Speaker 2>don't know what to make sense of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you describe conservatism in </v>

665
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:31.974
<v Speaker 2>2018 you gave me a little bit of sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your initial thoughts on it were </v>

666
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.693
<v Speaker 2>when you were 10 but right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of just sort of the </v>

667
00:27:37.591 --> 00:27:39.240
<v Speaker 2>state of conservatism?</v>

668
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.533
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's a pretty tough spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what we've done as a </v>

669
00:27:43.781 --> 00:27:44.614
<v Speaker 3>movement is just gone to everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's anti-left and I don't think that </v>

670
00:27:48.491 --> 00:27:49.324
<v Speaker 3>that's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think that it's </v>

671
00:27:50.531 --> 00:27:52.500
<v Speaker 3>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of the principles,</v>

672
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could go issue by issue,</v>

673
00:27:54.371 --> 00:27:55.204
<v Speaker 3>but there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of principals that I </v>

674
00:27:56.411 --> 00:27:59.920
<v Speaker 3>don't think are necessarily conservative</v>
<v Speaker 3>and are being pushed forward now.</v>

675
00:27:59.921 --> 00:28:00.754
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that there are some things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Ronald Reagan wouldn't support in </v>

676
00:28:03.761 --> 00:28:04.594
<v Speaker 3>today's time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I actually don't think that he'd be </v>

677
00:28:05.981 --> 00:28:08.590
<v Speaker 3>successful as a conservative in today's </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

678
00:28:08.591 --> 00:28:09.424
<v Speaker 3>I think people would see him as to </v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate too wishy washy when actually </v>

679
00:28:13.241 --> 00:28:15.010
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the token conservative.</v>

680
00:28:15.011 --> 00:28:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that is frustrating and</v>

681
00:28:17.381 --> 00:28:19.870
<v Speaker 3>I think on the environment and every </v>
<v Speaker 3>other issue,</v>

682
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.450
<v Speaker 3>the conservative goals to be Anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary,</v>

683
00:28:22.451 --> 00:28:23.284
<v Speaker 3>anti Bernie anti-left and sometimes we </v>
<v Speaker 3>forget to do our own solution and </v>

684
00:28:26.831 --> 00:28:29.230
<v Speaker 3>sometimes we just go to the exact </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite under the spectrum,</v>

685
00:28:29.231 --> 00:28:32.290
<v Speaker 3>which is just as dangerous as whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>the far left is proposing.</v>

686
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:33.183
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that that's worth </v>

687
00:28:34.241 --> 00:28:38.710
<v Speaker 3>conservatism is now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that is dangerous because if</v>

688
00:28:38.711 --> 00:28:39.544
<v Speaker 3>it keeps going down that path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the first party to start </v>

689
00:28:41.471 --> 00:28:45.160
<v Speaker 3>realizing that they're just going </v>
<v Speaker 3>further and further away from the truth.</v>

690
00:28:45.161 --> 00:28:46.480
<v Speaker 3>And the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

691
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.960
<v Speaker 3>are the first one to realize that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>change the course is going to have a lot</v>

692
00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:50.794
<v Speaker 3>of success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hope that conservatives can </v>

693
00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:56.890
<v Speaker 3>realize that and start to come back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>what conservatism truly is,</v>

694
00:28:56.891 --> 00:28:58.900
<v Speaker 3>which is free markets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>limited government.</v>

695
00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just bashing the left,</v>

696
00:29:01.241 --> 00:29:03.070
<v Speaker 3>it's trying to work with them if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

697
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.173
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not always a far right policy </v>

698
00:29:06.191 --> 00:29:07.024
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that what conservatism was </v>

699
00:29:10.331 --> 00:29:12.750
<v Speaker 3>in 2008 or 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

700
00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.070
<v Speaker 3>isn't exactly ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's more,</v>

701
00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.860
<v Speaker 3>it's closer to where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it should be than it is today.</v>

702
00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying trump's to blame,</v>

703
00:29:20.891 --> 00:29:21.724
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just a huge movement that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been sick of the laugh for so long </v>

704
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.990
<v Speaker 3>and sick of the radicalism of the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they've done the exact same.</v>

705
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.183
<v Speaker 3>And I think if we could just actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay true to our morals and take the </v>

706
00:29:33.101 --> 00:29:33.934
<v Speaker 3>higher ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it would be a lot better </v>

707
00:29:35.231 --> 00:29:35.800
<v Speaker 3>for the country.</v>

708
00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting the way you described </v>

709
00:29:37.151 --> 00:29:39.340
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whichever one stops first.</v>

710
00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in my view,</v>

711
00:29:40.451 --> 00:29:42.610
<v Speaker 2>and it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we come at this from different places,</v>

712
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:44.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was a card carrying lefty,</v>

713
00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:46.840
<v Speaker 2>progressive liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously a little older than you,</v>

714
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:48.880
<v Speaker 2>but you came at it from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the other side.</v>

715
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.110
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

716
00:29:50.111 --> 00:29:53.320
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that I focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just seen the left implode.</v>

717
00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.131
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if anything,</v>

718
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's basically like a train </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the brakes are off,</v>

719
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 2>they know the cliff is coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just going to keep going and</v>

720
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:01.110
<v Speaker 2>going and going and keep pouring call on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

721
00:30:01.111 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 2>And let's go off the cliff and see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

722
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

723
00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:04.483
<v Speaker 3>Don't mention Colton.</v>

724
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:07.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prayer.</v>

725
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

726
00:30:07.981 --> 00:30:09.990
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me that's what I've seen there.</v>

727
00:30:09.991 --> 00:30:10.824
<v Speaker 2>And I really spend a lot of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least these last couple years trying </v>

728
00:30:12.991 --> 00:30:15.150
<v Speaker 2>to correct that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

729
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.580
<v Speaker 2>What I do see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think maybe,</v>

730
00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.020
<v Speaker 2>maybe you agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe not as,</v>

731
00:30:19.021 --> 00:30:19.854
<v Speaker 2>I do see more fertile ground on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right for ideas that I can now go to </v>

732
00:30:24.361 --> 00:30:25.194
<v Speaker 2>libertarian events and conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>events and they hear my differences and </v>

733
00:30:28.501 --> 00:30:29.334
<v Speaker 2>they're willing to hear them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where I see virtually none of that on </v>

734
00:30:31.951 --> 00:30:32.784
<v Speaker 2>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's a fair estimation </v>

735
00:30:33.781 --> 00:30:36.540
<v Speaker 2>even though I know you were concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously about what's happening on the,</v>

736
00:30:36.541 --> 00:30:37.820
<v Speaker 2>on the fringes of the right?</v>

737
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.640
<v Speaker 3>I do to a certain degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

738
00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.240
<v Speaker 3>there is more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's a relative statement.</v>

739
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's enough.</v>

740
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's nowhere,</v>

741
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.510
<v Speaker 3>anywhere near enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

742
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.163
<v Speaker 3>I think the perfect example is that any </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative that doesn't agree with </v>

743
00:30:53.041 --> 00:30:53.874
<v Speaker 3>trump 100% of the time it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shunned and you look at an amount like </v>

744
00:30:57.211 --> 00:31:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Seapak or how the rnc looks at things or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

745
00:31:00.391 --> 00:31:01.224
<v Speaker 3>And I think that what they should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is embracing people of all </v>

746
00:31:04.171 --> 00:31:06.930
<v Speaker 3>ideologies that come from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative perspective.</v>

747
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.120
<v Speaker 3>And I think when it comes to young </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

748
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.370
<v Speaker 3>not every young person is gung Ho for </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

749
00:31:11.371 --> 00:31:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Not every young person is Gung Ho for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

750
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:14.573
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

751
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wall or whatever it may be.</v>

752
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:17.483
<v Speaker 3>And I think that conservatives need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>embrace the diversity more in a </v>

753
00:31:20.281 --> 00:31:22.950
<v Speaker 3>leadership level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think like I college campuses,</v>

754
00:31:22.951 --> 00:31:23.784
<v Speaker 3>like the College Republicans tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a more open and I think even like a </v>

755
00:31:27.511 --> 00:31:28.344
<v Speaker 3>county party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be more open to different </v>

756
00:31:29.791 --> 00:31:30.480
<v Speaker 3>views.</v>

757
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know every county party and then</v>

758
00:31:32.331 --> 00:31:34.530
<v Speaker 3>millions of counties that we have here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

759
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:35.683
<v Speaker 3>the fact of the matter is I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the national landscape or at least the </v>

760
00:31:38.491 --> 00:31:43.491
<v Speaker 3>national leaders are currently unlikely </v>
<v Speaker 3>to care about what no moderates think or</v>

761
00:31:44.881 --> 00:31:45.714
<v Speaker 3>what even our typical conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>things if they're not on 100% in </v>

762
00:31:48.841 --> 00:31:49.940
<v Speaker 3>agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

763
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:50.963
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think conferences kind of show that </v>

764
00:31:52.351 --> 00:31:53.910
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Seapak conference.</v>

765
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it,</v>

766
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.350
<v Speaker 3>and that's been an issue going on for </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

767
00:31:58.351 --> 00:32:01.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean the log cabin Republicans were </v>
<v Speaker 3>banned from Seapak for,</v>

768
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.071
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many years,</v>

769
00:32:02.071 --> 00:32:03.380
<v Speaker 3>six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

770
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.613
<v Speaker 3>and I think that we just need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversify the party and that's going to </v>

771
00:32:07.651 --> 00:32:11.370
<v Speaker 3>include non Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to include Lgbtq people,</v>

772
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 3>it's going to include minorities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

773
00:32:13.421 --> 00:32:14.254
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to include women and that's </v>

774
00:32:16.141 --> 00:32:16.974
<v Speaker 3>going to be the future of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Conservative Party along with the </v>

775
00:32:19.381 --> 00:32:21.480
<v Speaker 3>support that we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>

776
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.583
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be going down a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong track record and if we keep </v>

777
00:32:24.541 --> 00:32:27.270
<v Speaker 3>shaming all those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be tough.</v>

778
00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.890
<v Speaker 2>What part of you doesn't say you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian?</v>

779
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Because I think I know so much about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what your ideas are and you're trying to</v>

780
00:32:34.791 --> 00:32:35.624
<v Speaker 2>build all those bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give you a libertarian reason for </v>

781
00:32:37.551 --> 00:32:38.384
<v Speaker 2>why all of those people obviously should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be included in a conservative party or </v>

782
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:42.374
<v Speaker 2>any party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything about libertarian or </v>

783
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:45.224
<v Speaker 2>do you just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just doing a little political </v>

784
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:48.350
<v Speaker 2>realism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I hear from a lot of people.</v>

785
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.333
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Conservatives and the </v>

786
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Republicans are the party that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>work with most to to get those right.</v>

787
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.610
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's what you just said </v>
<v Speaker 3>is probably the best answer I have.</v>

788
00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:00.970
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that I would say is I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that there are,</v>

789
00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:01.863
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with Libertarian sometimes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the level of government that should be </v>

790
00:33:04.661 --> 00:33:07.330
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still a limited government person.</v>

791
00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:10.060
<v Speaker 3>I also think of myself as like a Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative,</v>

792
00:33:10.061 --> 00:33:10.894
<v Speaker 3>but Reagan wasn't anti government and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways he increased spending some </v>

793
00:33:14.981 --> 00:33:17.920
<v Speaker 3>times he did taxes when it is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

794
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.350
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm limited government and when spending</v>

795
00:33:20.351 --> 00:33:22.720
<v Speaker 3>is not possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should never,</v>

796
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should ever perceive spending if it,</v>

797
00:33:24.281 --> 00:33:25.114
<v Speaker 3>if it can be avoided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same with taxes and everything like </v>

798
00:33:27.281 --> 00:33:28.114
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also don't think that it's </v>

799
00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.660
<v Speaker 3>completely off the table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which some libertarians do.</v>

800
00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:32.494
<v Speaker 3>Not all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that I probably issues why </v>

801
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:38.890
<v Speaker 3>is agreeing North Libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially on social things,</v>

802
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe even immigration.</v>

803
00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think at some of the,</v>

804
00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.390
<v Speaker 3>just the overarching government </v>
<v Speaker 3>involvement,</v>

805
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I think the government does have a place</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some things.</v>

806
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:49.743
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it should be trying to help the </v>

807
00:33:50.981 --> 00:33:52.260
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

808
00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.750
<v Speaker 3>instead of push things on the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is,</v>

809
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.930
<v Speaker 3>is something that maybe makes me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit more moderate.</v>

810
00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:58.923
<v Speaker 2>You've decided to put your stop if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the Republican or the right </v>

811
00:34:02.081 --> 00:34:02.914
<v Speaker 2>conservative trains going off that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've decided to put your stake in </v>

812
00:34:05.021 --> 00:34:07.600
<v Speaker 2>the ground and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to talk about environment.</v>

813
00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now even just hashtag green gop,</v>

814
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:13.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean people think the Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the general consensus out there,</v>

815
00:34:13.841 --> 00:34:15.460
<v Speaker 2>if you ask the average person walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the street,</v>

816
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Republicans either hate the environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>

817
00:34:17.741 --> 00:34:21.610
<v Speaker 2>or they want endless pollution and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in industry more than the earth.</v>

818
00:34:21.611 --> 00:34:22.444
<v Speaker 2>I mean just you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this stuff that really generally </v>

819
00:34:25.211 --> 00:34:26.044
<v Speaker 2>I find not to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they haven't done a great job on </v>

820
00:34:27.971 --> 00:34:28.870
<v Speaker 2>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

821
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.273
<v Speaker 2>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much do you think people your age </v>

822
00:34:32.321 --> 00:34:34.720
<v Speaker 2>generally care about the environment?</v>

823
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:35.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think,</v>

824
00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:36.584
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millennials according to some recent </v>

825
00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:40.250
<v Speaker 3>polling showed that that's the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>important issue.</v>

826
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment is in terms of when they</v>

827
00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:45.190
<v Speaker 3>go to the voting booth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

828
00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.680
<v Speaker 3>the University of Texas and Pew Research</v>
<v Speaker 3>polls have shown that.</v>

829
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.633
<v Speaker 3>So I think that that's a huge wakeup </v>
<v Speaker 3>call to conservatives that this is </v>

830
00:34:51.921 --> 00:34:55.640
<v Speaker 3>something that an important voter base </v>
<v Speaker 3>is interested in tackling.</v>

831
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.833
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that most conservatives are </v>

832
00:34:58.821 --> 00:35:01.130
<v Speaker 3>behind clean energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when they're young.</v>

833
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millennials especially.</v>

834
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:05.330
<v Speaker 3>And then obviously the laughters as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

835
00:35:05.331 --> 00:35:06.164
<v Speaker 3>And so I think clean energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainability and just the general </v>

836
00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:13.040
<v Speaker 3>environmental issues are very important </v>
<v Speaker 3>to young people.</v>

837
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.490
<v Speaker 3>And then a recent poll just came out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that showed that climate change,</v>

838
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>57% of conservatives,</v>

839
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millennials want action on it,</v>

840
00:35:21.141 --> 00:35:21.974
<v Speaker 3>which is a pretty big amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got 77% of independence </v>

841
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:25.933
<v Speaker 3>and an 84% of liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So climate change is also a very </v>

842
00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:29.294
<v Speaker 3>important issue to millennials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that all those together to </v>

843
00:35:30.761 --> 00:35:31.594
<v Speaker 3>kind of showcase why it's important that</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative starts to talk about these </v>

844
00:35:34.101 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

845
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you have this new thing is </v>

846
00:35:36.021 --> 00:35:36.854
<v Speaker 2>about belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether people actually believe the </v>

847
00:35:39.481 --> 00:35:40.314
<v Speaker 2>science on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of whether manmade climate change is </v>

848
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:44.064
<v Speaker 2>real versus just what the answers are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know you were focusing on the </v>

849
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:48.090
<v Speaker 2>answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I want to get into,</v>

850
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.030
<v Speaker 2>but that basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning it's either you have some set of</v>

851
00:35:51.031 --> 00:35:51.864
<v Speaker 2>people that believe or don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you have this other subset of </v>

852
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:58.170
<v Speaker 2>people that either think the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the answer or that the private sector</v>

853
00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 2>is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you even get those things to meet</v>

854
00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:01.660
<v Speaker 2>in some way?</v>

855
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:02.493
<v Speaker 3>So I think that the private sector and </v>
<v Speaker 3>limited government is the answer for </v>

856
00:36:05.411 --> 00:36:06.244
<v Speaker 3>these issues and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or if you believe the science or don't </v>

857
00:36:07.781 --> 00:36:09.220
<v Speaker 3>believe the science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we all,</v>

858
00:36:09.221 --> 00:36:12.970
<v Speaker 3>like we said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can agree that these issues do matter.</v>

859
00:36:12.971 --> 00:36:14.320
<v Speaker 3>That protecting the earth doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter,</v>

860
00:36:14.321 --> 00:36:15.880
<v Speaker 3>no matter if climate change is real or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

861
00:36:15.881 --> 00:36:19.570
<v Speaker 3>we still have a duty to protect the land</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we've been given by God.</v>

862
00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.673
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think that that's something </v>

863
00:36:22.061 --> 00:36:27.061
<v Speaker 3>that can gel with most conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then with people on the left or even</v>

864
00:36:27.191 --> 00:36:28.024
<v Speaker 3>independence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there are kind of convinced that big </v>

865
00:36:29.891 --> 00:36:32.530
<v Speaker 3>government is the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has been kind of the only solution</v>

866
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.700
<v Speaker 3>proposed so far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

867
00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:38.440
<v Speaker 3>It's our job as conservatives to </v>
<v Speaker 3>showcase why one that doesn't work,</v>

868
00:36:38.441 --> 00:36:41.080
<v Speaker 3>which is what we do focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but two is</v>

869
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.680
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's focus on one for a minute.</v>

870
00:36:42.681 --> 00:36:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Why doesn't that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think most people,</v>

871
00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.690
<v Speaker 2>because most people don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>critically about these things,</v>

872
00:36:47.691 --> 00:36:48.291
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

873
00:36:48.291 --> 00:36:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I believe in climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The meme is out there.</v>

874
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe in climate change,</v>

875
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.390
<v Speaker 2>they always look to the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go,</v>

876
00:36:54.391 --> 00:36:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in climate change.</v>

877
00:36:55.431 --> 00:36:56.264
<v Speaker 2>What's the government doing about it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to the alternatives that you're </v>

878
00:36:58.941 --> 00:36:59.631
<v Speaker 2>offering?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first,</v>

879
00:36:59.631 --> 00:37:00.920
<v Speaker 2>how do you disconnect those two things?</v>

880
00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:01.803
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first problem is that most people </v>

881
00:37:02.951 --> 00:37:03.784
<v Speaker 3>have only seen that as the only answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's all the thick hand associated </v>

882
00:37:06.101 --> 00:37:09.040
<v Speaker 3>with environmental progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a problem in itself.</v>

883
00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.530
<v Speaker 3>But why they haven't worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why had,</v>

884
00:37:11.531 --> 00:37:13.360
<v Speaker 3>the big government hasn't worked on </v>
<v Speaker 3>these issues.</v>

885
00:37:13.361 --> 00:37:15.970
<v Speaker 3>And some examples of that is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>endangered species act,</v>

886
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:19.690
<v Speaker 3>which has only taken 1% of the listings </v>
<v Speaker 3>awful list,</v>

887
00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:20.683
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since 1982 and there had been a ton of </v>

888
00:37:23.171 --> 00:37:24.940
<v Speaker 3>new species added.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that is,</v>

889
00:37:24.941 --> 00:37:28.480
<v Speaker 3>is because private land owners don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have any rights on their land.</v>

890
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.220
<v Speaker 3>If they have a endangered species that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>residing on their land,</v>

891
00:37:33.221 --> 00:37:35.200
<v Speaker 3>the government can come in and take it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>control it.</v>

892
00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:36.243
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really frustrating to land </v>

893
00:37:37.481 --> 00:37:39.490
<v Speaker 3>owners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they try to do is either move it</v>

894
00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:42.760
<v Speaker 3>off their land or they just shoot it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bury it so they can keep their land,</v>

895
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:44.003
<v Speaker 3>which is again people just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid big government from coming in and </v>

896
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:47.764
<v Speaker 3>taking their private property because </v>
<v Speaker 3>private property is one of the most </v>

897
00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.493
<v Speaker 3>inherent rights that we have and </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that people really like to </v>

898
00:37:52.781 --> 00:37:53.440
<v Speaker 3>protect.</v>

899
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Just pause there cause what a what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whacked out situation that is.</v>

900
00:37:56.141 --> 00:37:56.974
<v Speaker 2>So if you have some private land that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has something that's on this endangered </v>

901
00:37:59.291 --> 00:38:02.290
<v Speaker 2>species list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might go ahead and kill it.</v>

902
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.153
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that the government won't know that </v>

903
00:38:04.301 --> 00:38:06.460
<v Speaker 2>it's there so that even if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to,</v>

904
00:38:06.461 --> 00:38:08.440
<v Speaker 2>you might love animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might love nature.</v>

905
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Usually the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

906
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I would assume most of these people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>would probably is the case.</v>

907
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:12.843
<v Speaker 2>You might literally be killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>endangered animals just so the </v>

908
00:38:14.831 --> 00:38:18.550
<v Speaker 2>government won't take your land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how warp to this whole thing is.</v>

909
00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the uh,</v>

910
00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.310
<v Speaker 3>the mantra is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot,</v>

911
00:38:21.311 --> 00:38:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Barry shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a common thread when it comes to</v>

912
00:38:24.191 --> 00:38:25.024
<v Speaker 3>endangered species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A and kind of how private land owners </v>

913
00:38:27.881 --> 00:38:28.714
<v Speaker 3>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really sad because like you </v>

914
00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:31.660
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them do care about animals.</v>

915
00:38:31.661 --> 00:38:32.494
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have farms and they just have </v>

916
00:38:33.281 --> 00:38:37.480
<v Speaker 3>private property and they love nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why they have a place in nature.</v>

917
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.610
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to shoot these places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also don't,</v>

918
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.473
<v Speaker 3>or these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also don't want to give up </v>

919
00:38:41.381 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 3>their land and have it controlled by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

920
00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:45.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until,</v>

921
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.750
<v Speaker 3>until whatever date they deem fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

922
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.240
<v Speaker 3>and that would be really frustrating as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a private land owner who worked hard and</v>

923
00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:55.030
<v Speaker 3>purchase the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not a good way to approach it.</v>

924
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:55.864
<v Speaker 3>And that is the same problem that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>had with tons of other issues is that </v>

925
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.093
<v Speaker 3>when there's big government involved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always a loophole to get around </v>

926
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

927
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.210
<v Speaker 3>There's always a loophole to get around </v>
<v Speaker 3>the punishment.</v>

928
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.223
<v Speaker 3>And usually that loophole hurts the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment is people don't respond </v>

929
00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The punishments,</v>

930
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:09.783
<v Speaker 3>they respond well to incentives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They respond well to doing things on </v>

931
00:39:12.671 --> 00:39:16.210
<v Speaker 3>their own for moral good or economic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wellbeing.</v>

932
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.820
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that's where the policies</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to shift.</v>

933
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.953
<v Speaker 3>And then another example of the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>government not working is the Paris </v>

934
00:39:22.121 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 3>climate accords,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

935
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:24.760
<v Speaker 3>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in theory,</v>

936
00:39:24.761 --> 00:39:25.594
<v Speaker 3>having every country come together to </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to help the environment is a great </v>

937
00:39:28.061 --> 00:39:28.691
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

938
00:39:28.691 --> 00:39:31.770
<v Speaker 3>That that just sounds nice and peachy of</v>
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>

939
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

940
00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:34.403
<v Speaker 3>But then when you're making the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who aren't polluting pay for it and the </v>

941
00:39:38.021 --> 00:39:38.854
<v Speaker 3>people who are polluting go off scotch </v>
<v Speaker 3>free and no countries are meeting their </v>

942
00:39:42.761 --> 00:39:43.594
<v Speaker 3>goals and there's just a ton of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>being thrown around that's going to no </v>

943
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:51.880
<v Speaker 3>benefit or it has no benefit on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and it's non binding.</v>

944
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.713
<v Speaker 3>There was nonbinding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was literally no mechanism to </v>

945
00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:55.564
<v Speaker 3>force anyone to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the u s could do the bulk of the </v>

946
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.990
<v Speaker 3>payments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't have any mechanism to check</v>

947
00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:03.490
<v Speaker 3>whether anyone's doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

948
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.150
<v Speaker 3>And we're doing those things in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting emissions on her own.</v>

949
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.760
<v Speaker 3>It's technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's innovation,</v>

950
00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.310
<v Speaker 3>it's hybrid cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which the left loves to paint.</v>

951
00:40:12.311 --> 00:40:13.870
<v Speaker 3>But where did it come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The free market.</v>

952
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Where's the electric cars come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The free market.</v>

953
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.350
<v Speaker 3>Where has Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're having Microsoft and apple and all</v>

954
00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:22.600
<v Speaker 3>these companies who have started to cut </v>
<v Speaker 3>their emissions.</v>

955
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.880
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it because of the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it.</v>

956
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:25.743
<v Speaker 3>Not because the government is telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to not be as the Paris climate </v>

957
00:40:27.551 --> 00:40:28.384
<v Speaker 3>accords are telling them to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because they know it's the right </v>

958
00:40:29.891 --> 00:40:31.900
<v Speaker 3>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sensible thing to do.</v>

959
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:36.730
<v Speaker 3>I on an economic level and even oil and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gas companies are cleaning up their acts</v>

960
00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:37.564
<v Speaker 3>because they know it's necessary for pr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also know that being more </v>

961
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.153
<v Speaker 3>environmentally sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be better in the long run </v>

962
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:44.943
<v Speaker 3>economically.</v>

963
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.570
<v Speaker 3>So it's not going to be some huge accord</v>
<v Speaker 3>that changes these things,</v>

964
00:40:49.571 --> 00:40:50.404
<v Speaker 3>especially when they're not pressuring </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right countries like China to </v>

965
00:40:53.711 --> 00:40:54.544
<v Speaker 3>actually act and do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be countries deciding on </v>

966
00:40:57.731 --> 00:41:01.240
<v Speaker 3>their own level what's going to be right</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how they're going to fix it.</v>

967
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:02.163
<v Speaker 3>And if countries want to come together </v>
<v Speaker 3>and create an actually cohesive plan </v>

968
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:10.030
<v Speaker 3>that works and gets things done and give</v>
<v Speaker 3>some flexibility and doesn't,</v>

969
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:12.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just do nothing,</v>

970
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:13.143
<v Speaker 3>then that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That should be something that happens </v>

971
00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:15.423
<v Speaker 3>and something that president trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>should actually encourage a beneficial </v>

972
00:41:18.521 --> 00:41:19.354
<v Speaker 3>accords.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Paris climate accords doesn't do </v>

973
00:41:20.381 --> 00:41:21.214
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's an example of big government </v>

974
00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:23.560
<v Speaker 3>failing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that you're linking this directly</v>

975
00:41:23.561 --> 00:41:25.840
<v Speaker 3>to technology because it also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sorta like,</v>

976
00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:26.674
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago if there was an oil spill </v>

977
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:31.060
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in some remote area of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Antarctica,</v>

978
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:33.620
<v Speaker 3>most likely we wouldn't have heard about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

979
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless</v>

980
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.020
<v Speaker 2>it was a massive one like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm about these or something.</v>

981
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.450
<v Speaker 2>But like a lot you could get away with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

982
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 2>But these days literally everyone in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Western world at least has a cell phone,</v>

983
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 2>right worker is at these places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's a leak,</v>

984
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:47.023
<v Speaker 2>can videotape it anonymously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upload it to twitter and then everyone </v>

985
00:41:50.571 --> 00:41:53.600
<v Speaker 2>finds out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's so obvious to me that technology</v>

986
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.270
<v Speaker 2>is the answer here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

987
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause everyone's always afraid if you </v>

988
00:41:56.511 --> 00:41:58.310
<v Speaker 2>get rid of any of these lines is what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear from,</v>

989
00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:00.230
<v Speaker 2>from the left all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been here this from,</v>

990
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.420
<v Speaker 2>from bill models and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get rid of these laws,</v>

991
00:42:02.421 --> 00:42:03.800
<v Speaker 2>they are going to start polluting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lake,</v>

992
00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right next to the,</v>

993
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 2>to the factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

994
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.390
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually no,</v>

995
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.240
<v Speaker 2>not anymore.</v>

996
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.073
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accountable.</v>

997
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:11.103
<v Speaker 3>And that's just the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of that I'd love to point out </v>

998
00:42:12.821 --> 00:42:16.270
<v Speaker 3>is that technology is the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 3>emissions those have started to go down.</v>

999
00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.373
<v Speaker 3>Technology is the reason why we have so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many amazing opportunities to fix the </v>

1000
00:42:21.341 --> 00:42:22.174
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no big government regulation </v>

1001
00:42:23.921 --> 00:42:27.070
<v Speaker 3>that's able to cut emissions like </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology can.</v>

1002
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:32.430
<v Speaker 3>And one thing that's really amazingly </v>
<v Speaker 3>pointed out by one of our board members,</v>

1003
00:42:32.501 --> 00:42:33.334
<v Speaker 3>Todd Myers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that thing about how much the iphone </v>

1004
00:42:35.111 --> 00:42:38.080
<v Speaker 3>itself can do and conservation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate.</v>

1005
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.320
<v Speaker 3>You are able to control your heating and</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy costs from your phone,</v>

1006
00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.513
<v Speaker 3>turn off the energy when you don't use </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and control it completely from your </v>

1007
00:42:49.391 --> 00:42:50.224
<v Speaker 3>phone instead of having to run back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your house before you go on a long </v>

1008
00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.700
<v Speaker 3>vacation or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then just saying,</v>

1009
00:42:54.701 --> 00:42:55.421
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a screw it,</v>

1010
00:42:55.421 --> 00:42:57.460
<v Speaker 3>I'll just leave them on my lights or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever it is.</v>

1011
00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's helping the environment a ton and</v>

1012
00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.640
<v Speaker 3>each year more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1013
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:07.650
<v Speaker 3>effective cars come out with more miles </v>
<v Speaker 3>per the gallon or electric and hybrid or</v>

1014
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.930
<v Speaker 3>electric is starting to really start to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take over,</v>

1015
00:43:10.931 --> 00:43:11.764
<v Speaker 3>which is really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's technology that's not the </v>

1016
00:43:13.361 --> 00:43:14.194
<v Speaker 3>government and technology and </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental progress go hand in hand </v>

1017
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:22.000
<v Speaker 3>and you look at oil spills or you look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at nuclear waste or whatever.</v>

1018
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.193
<v Speaker 3>All those have improved dramatically </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the past couple of decades because </v>

1019
00:43:26.051 --> 00:43:28.000
<v Speaker 3>these companies know that that has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1020
00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:28.893
<v Speaker 3>People will find out about it and never </v>
<v Speaker 3>give them business again and basically </v>

1021
00:43:32.561 --> 00:43:35.050
<v Speaker 3>shut down their business if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if more accidents start to happen.</v>

1022
00:43:35.051 --> 00:43:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at what bp went through.</v>

1023
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:37.743
<v Speaker 3>BP is one of the best stewards on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment out of gas companies ever </v>

1024
00:43:40.841 --> 00:43:41.674
<v Speaker 3>since then because they know that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't have that type of a situation </v>

1025
00:43:44.201 --> 00:43:44.470
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1026
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:45.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't have like how many days was </v>

1027
00:43:46.421 --> 00:43:48.460
<v Speaker 2>that thing leaking and there was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>live camera on.</v>

1028
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knew about it.</v>

1029
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:53.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean if she has any American they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would know about the BP oil spill.</v>

1030
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Where do you guys stand on nuclear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a couple of weeks ago,</v>

1031
00:43:55.801 --> 00:43:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I had Mike Shellenberger in here who </v>
<v Speaker 2>love my shown.</v>

1032
00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:58.831
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1033
00:43:58.831 --> 00:44:00.390
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is interesting then.</v>

1034
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.630
<v Speaker 2>So you are a conservative with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian leanings.</v>

1035
00:44:03.631 --> 00:44:04.464
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's running for governor of California </v>

1036
00:44:06.151 --> 00:44:07.320
<v Speaker 2>as a Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1037
00:44:07.321 --> 00:44:09.520
<v Speaker 2>he started as an independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think just for,</v>

1038
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.120
<v Speaker 2>because of a little political realism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's running as a Democrat,</v>

1039
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:13.223
<v Speaker 2>but obviously for nuclear power and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to erase some of the stigma to </v>

1040
00:44:16.321 --> 00:44:17.154
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which there's obviously a tremendous </v>

1041
00:44:17.761 --> 00:44:18.211
<v Speaker 2>amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1042
00:44:18.211 --> 00:44:19.044
<v Speaker 2>just unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fukushima was just a couple of years </v>

1043
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.061
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1044
00:44:21.061 --> 00:44:22.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's interesting.</v>

1045
00:44:22.681 --> 00:44:23.610
<v Speaker 2>So you like this guy.</v>

1046
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:24.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Shellenberger is a perfect </v>

1047
00:44:25.451 --> 00:44:29.950
<v Speaker 3>example of what democrats need to aspire</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be and that is common sense.</v>

1048
00:44:29.951 --> 00:44:30.784
<v Speaker 3>Able to work with sides isn't afraid to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just stray away from the talking points </v>

1049
00:44:35.761 --> 00:44:36.810
<v Speaker 3>of the laughed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1050
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 3>which are usually incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially on like nuclear.</v>

1051
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:41.123
<v Speaker 3>Nuclear is supposed to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous and harmful when in reality </v>

1052
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Michael Shellenberger knows that.</v>

1053
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:48.990
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1054
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.823
<v Speaker 3>Michael Shellenberger is great and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that California would be much </v>

1055
00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:55.440
<v Speaker 3>improved by having a governor as </v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate as him.</v>

1056
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get me Gavin newsome.</v>

1058
00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what can you do proper?</v>

1059
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Michael should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I may have to move to Wisconsin.</v>

1060
00:45:04.161 --> 00:45:04.994
<v Speaker 3>I think it's got water is great and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think he'll be there for another four </v>

1061
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:08.310
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully after this year.</v>

1062
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:09.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1063
00:45:09.751 --> 00:45:10.584
<v Speaker 3>I think nuclear is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an important part of an all of the </v>

1064
00:45:12.631 --> 00:45:15.660
<v Speaker 3>above energy strategy that America needs</v>
<v Speaker 3>to start adopting.</v>

1065
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:20.400
<v Speaker 3>And nuclear is the least amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidents out of any energy sector.</v>

1066
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.830
<v Speaker 3>They're really improving a technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1067
00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:26.100
<v Speaker 3>if there's only been like three nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidents in history,</v>

1068
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.650
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows about them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're terrible.</v>

1069
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.570
<v Speaker 3>But there haven't been any since Japan </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1070
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:33.090
<v Speaker 3>and all of them are avoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them are avoidable.</v>

1071
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:33.924
<v Speaker 3>None of them have happened in the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States because the United States has </v>

1072
00:45:35.791 --> 00:45:39.180
<v Speaker 3>been careful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these companies are careful and it's</v>

1073
00:45:39.181 --> 00:45:40.014
<v Speaker 3>almost become impossible with recent </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology to have an accident like </v>

1074
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you were like deliberately trying</v>

1075
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.240
<v Speaker 3>to hurt the area around you and trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1076
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:49.440
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to release the waste.</v>

1077
00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.493
<v Speaker 2>Is it partly because of government </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation that our nuclear plants </v>

1078
00:45:54.071 --> 00:45:56.950
<v Speaker 2>haven't had problems that keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you give any credit in that way?</v>

1079
00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:57.791
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1080
00:45:57.791 --> 00:46:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about how those </v>
<v Speaker 3>regulations have worked,</v>

1081
00:46:00.251 --> 00:46:01.084
<v Speaker 3>but all I know is that regulations from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the government have shut down nuclear </v>

1082
00:46:03.701 --> 00:46:04.880
<v Speaker 3>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1083
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.833
<v Speaker 3>because right now they're discouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nuclear plants are being built and not </v>

1084
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:10.684
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think any are being built </v>

1085
00:46:11.231 --> 00:46:12.250
<v Speaker 3>currently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1086
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.113
<v Speaker 3>because the United States government is </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to phase it out when really it's </v>

1087
00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.660
<v Speaker 3>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's clean,</v>

1088
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:17.523
<v Speaker 3>it's effective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it cuts and missions and it's very </v>

1089
00:46:18.881 --> 00:46:20.380
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1090
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:21.543
<v Speaker 3>and I know that I think the vast </v>
<v Speaker 3>majority of the changes have come from </v>

1091
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.273
<v Speaker 3>these companies realizing that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no way for them to succeed if they </v>

1092
00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.720
<v Speaker 3>aren't careful with their operations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they also know that,</v>

1093
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're a terrible human being,</v>

1094
00:46:36.461 --> 00:46:37.294
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to put nuclear waste and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to give everyone cancer </v>

1095
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.790
<v Speaker 3>and have them die unless you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible human being.</v>

1096
00:46:42.791 --> 00:46:45.340
<v Speaker 3>So I think that that's also just part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing.</v>

1097
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:46.020
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1098
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:46.853
<v Speaker 3>and new technology is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is making nuclear more effective and </v>

1099
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:51.330
<v Speaker 3>less dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1100
00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.440
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's safe to say that nuclear is</v>

1101
00:46:53.441 --> 00:46:55.930
<v Speaker 3>almost a hundred percent foolproof at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this point in time.</v>

1102
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.180
<v Speaker 2>But you can't always go on the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>intention to these people cause,</v>

1103
00:46:59.181 --> 00:46:59.521
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1104
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:00.354
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't want people that have </v>

1105
00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.300
<v Speaker 2>cancer and do all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1106
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.710
<v Speaker 2>business owners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like government regulators often do</v>

1107
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:08.544
<v Speaker 2>shady things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's part of the issue here is that </v>

1108
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.900
<v Speaker 2>you can't always control the business </v>
<v Speaker 2>owner.</v>

1109
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The industrialist.</v>

1110
00:47:14.371 --> 00:47:16.230
<v Speaker 2>But you also can't always control the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

1111
00:47:16.231 --> 00:47:18.030
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a perfect answer here,</v>

1112
00:47:18.031 --> 00:47:18.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.150
<v Speaker 3>No there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that there are,</v>

1114
00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:25.190
<v Speaker 3>it is the duty of the government to </v>
<v Speaker 3>protect the people to a certain degree.</v>

1115
00:47:25.191 --> 00:47:26.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not it.</v>

1116
00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:28.820
<v Speaker 3>They have to band murder and they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to ban certain things.</v>

1117
00:47:28.821 --> 00:47:30.430
<v Speaker 3>So not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1118
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:31.653
<v Speaker 3>so that's not lawful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that certain basic </v>

1119
00:47:33.731 --> 00:47:34.564
<v Speaker 3>protections can be put in place on </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear to make sure that these </v>

1120
00:47:37.511 --> 00:47:39.790
<v Speaker 3>companies are making sure that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>

1121
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.953
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't be so stringent that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't start one up or that you get </v>

1122
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 3>punished for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1123
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what x,</v>

1124
00:47:46.091 --> 00:47:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Y or z unless it's a terrible breach of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>

1125
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:50.613
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that that's something that </v>

1126
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:52.384
<v Speaker 3>the government can play into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be more up to the </v>

1127
00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:55.054
<v Speaker 3>technology and the business owners to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the answers to make nuclear better </v>

1128
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 3>with a couple basic nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1129
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:01.810
<v Speaker 3>government regulations.</v>

1130
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.753
<v Speaker 2>What kind of traction are you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting sorta with mainstream </v>

1131
00:48:05.161 --> 00:48:05.994
<v Speaker 2>Republicans and with people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>office right now because these seem to </v>

1132
00:48:08.911 --> 00:48:11.730
<v Speaker 2>be the answers that I would love these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys to take a,</v>

1133
00:48:11.731 --> 00:48:13.590
<v Speaker 2>but they've been very hesitant to take.</v>

1134
00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one thing before we even launched </v>

1135
00:48:16.321 --> 00:48:17.154
<v Speaker 3>this organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met with a lot of congressmen and </v>

1136
00:48:18.341 --> 00:48:19.174
<v Speaker 3>women and the on the Republican side and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said that they cared about these </v>

1137
00:48:22.301 --> 00:48:23.950
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to tackle them,</v>

1138
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.650
<v Speaker 3>but the only reason I didn't was because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't hear from their base.</v>

1139
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.680
<v Speaker 3>They only heard it from the Sierra Club </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the League of conservation voters.</v>

1140
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:31.203
<v Speaker 3>And the fact of the matter is those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are never going to be their </v>

1141
00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:34.480
<v Speaker 3>voters and matter how they come out on </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental issues.</v>

1142
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:40.110
<v Speaker 3>So we think that there is a latent base </v>
<v Speaker 3>of support not only at the base but with</v>

1143
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.760
<v Speaker 3>legislators who want to lead on these </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>

1144
00:48:42.761 --> 00:48:45.220
<v Speaker 3>but they just need some uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing.</v>

1145
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:46.263
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think that that's something that </v>

1146
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:52.240
<v Speaker 3>the conservative movement is ready for </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are a good handful of 20 to 25</v>

1147
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.600
<v Speaker 3>current Republican congressmen and women</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are already leading on these issues.</v>

1148
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.433
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of getting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>number up and starting to have those </v>

1149
00:48:59.051 --> 00:49:01.660
<v Speaker 3>legislators hear from their base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the base.</v>

1150
00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.210
<v Speaker 3>The base is totally ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially millennials,</v>

1151
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.850
<v Speaker 3>like I was talking about earlier with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the polling that's been done.</v>

1152
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:08.163
<v Speaker 3>Basically all young conservatives care </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the environment in one way or the </v>

1153
00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:12.250
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter if it's climate change related</v>

1154
00:49:12.251 --> 00:49:13.840
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're ready for clean energy.</v>

1155
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.090
<v Speaker 3>They're ready for all of the above </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>

1156
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.730
<v Speaker 3>They're ready for common sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation practices.</v>

1157
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:20.223
<v Speaker 3>And so we have had such success with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>base that we have 37 out of 50 college </v>

1158
00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:25.294
<v Speaker 3>Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>state chairs on board with what we're </v>

1159
00:49:26.591 --> 00:49:27.424
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was more to come in the next few </v>

1160
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:29.793
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are working with countless college </v>

1161
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:31.954
<v Speaker 3>Republican and turning point USA and </v>
<v Speaker 3>young Americans for freedom chapters </v>

1162
00:49:34.481 --> 00:49:36.760
<v Speaker 3>across the country to spread some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>

1163
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.520
<v Speaker 3>We have the support of all the youth </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaders on the right.</v>

1164
00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Kirk Chandler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thorton of the College Republicans,</v>

1165
00:49:41.921 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 3>grants Strobel as young Americans for </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>

1166
00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really been welcoming and we hadn't</v>

1167
00:49:47.201 --> 00:49:48.034
<v Speaker 3>really gotten too much flak from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right because they're so ready for </v>

1168
00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:51.850
<v Speaker 3>something like this with common sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions.</v>

1169
00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:52.773
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does this feel like a little bit of a </v>

1170
00:49:53.831 --> 00:49:54.664
<v Speaker 2>perfect storm right now for you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what's going on on college </v>

1171
00:49:56.891 --> 00:49:57.850
<v Speaker 2>campuses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1172
00:49:57.851 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had charlie in here from turning point</v>

1173
00:49:59.951 --> 00:50:00.784
<v Speaker 2>a couple of weeks ago and I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy is just knocking it out of the </v>

1174
00:50:02.381 --> 00:50:04.490
<v Speaker 2>park it every day what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:07.180
<v Speaker 2>It's just incredible to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even for the things that I disagree with</v>

1176
00:50:07.181 --> 00:50:07.750
<v Speaker 2>them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1177
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:10.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've really built this grass</v>
<v Speaker 2>root thing.</v>

1178
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I was just at the students for liberty </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference a couple of weeks ago.</v>

1179
00:50:12.881 --> 00:50:13.714
<v Speaker 2>I thought what they were doing is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're doing is great that </v>

1180
00:50:15.641 --> 00:50:16.474
<v Speaker 2>suddenly it seems like there's this like</v>
<v Speaker 2>backlash against the hysteria of the </v>

1181
00:50:19.601 --> 00:50:23.650
<v Speaker 2>left than what you would say is also the</v>
<v Speaker 2>the history or at least in environmental</v>

1182
00:50:23.651 --> 00:50:24.484
<v Speaker 2>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the backward thinking of the right that </v>

1183
00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:29.240
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of led to a nice moment here </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1184
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there are some other answers.</v>

1185
00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think college students are so sick</v>

1186
00:50:33.991 --> 00:50:38.130
<v Speaker 3>of being painted as anti environment and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't really know where to amp that</v>

1187
00:50:38.131 --> 00:50:38.964
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The answer is and concern us haven't </v>

1188
00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.330
<v Speaker 3>really provided the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just go on and go after the last,</v>

1189
00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.173
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to criticize the left on their </v>

1190
00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:46.350
<v Speaker 3>environmental policies that haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked,</v>

1191
00:50:46.351 --> 00:50:48.660
<v Speaker 3>but we also have to provide our own </v>
<v Speaker 3>answers and I think you're,</v>

1192
00:50:48.661 --> 00:50:51.060
<v Speaker 3>you hit on something perfectly in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>college.</v>

1193
00:50:51.061 --> 00:50:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Students are always looking for more </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and uh,</v>

1194
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.450
<v Speaker 3>to be more active and issues that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>care about.</v>

1195
00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.313
<v Speaker 3>Turning Point USA has done that ton of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ton of other organizations have begun </v>

1196
00:51:01.231 --> 00:51:02.064
<v Speaker 3>to really activate young people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the environment is something that's </v>

1197
00:51:05.671 --> 00:51:06.504
<v Speaker 3>been kind of left out so far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why turning point in College </v>

1198
00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:09.563
<v Speaker 3>Republicans are so supportive is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they realize that that's an important </v>

1199
00:51:10.831 --> 00:51:11.664
<v Speaker 3>part of their mission is to garner </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention and activism from people that </v>

1200
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.433
<v Speaker 3>may really care about the environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe a little bit hesitant to be </v>

1201
00:51:18.841 --> 00:51:21.570
<v Speaker 3>active unless the conservatives are more</v>
<v Speaker 3>active on that issue.</v>

1202
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:22.643
<v Speaker 3>So I think that is a perfect storm and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no other group like us out </v>

1203
00:51:25.711 --> 00:51:26.544
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no group advocating for </v>

1204
00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:30.180
<v Speaker 3>conservative environmental solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're doing it,</v>

1205
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.313
<v Speaker 3>focusing on millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's nobody doing it for any age </v>

1206
00:51:33.001 --> 00:51:33.834
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're having to work with </v>

1207
00:51:34.741 --> 00:51:35.574
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1208
00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's perfect.</v>

1209
00:51:36.811 --> 00:51:38.190
<v Speaker 3>And then also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1210
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.503
<v Speaker 3>conservatives are looking for a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to liberals on some issues on </v>

1211
00:51:42.061 --> 00:51:45.210
<v Speaker 3>college campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>College campuses are so divided that,</v>

1212
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bring in a speaker,</v>

1213
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:50.070
<v Speaker 3>even if they're the most moderate </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaker and there's protests,</v>

1214
00:51:50.071 --> 00:51:51.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up the Wazoo,</v>

1215
00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:51.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1216
00:51:51.931 --> 00:51:53.850
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no end to it.</v>

1217
00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.420
<v Speaker 3>Even if you bring in John Case that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get half,</v>

1218
00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:58.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half of your school out there protesting</v>

1219
00:51:58.771 --> 00:52:00.120
<v Speaker 3>saying he's a white nationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1220
00:52:00.121 --> 00:52:02.310
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even though most people would say the</v>

1221
00:52:02.311 --> 00:52:03.144
<v Speaker 3>navy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he identifies more with the Democratic </v>

1222
00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:04.800
<v Speaker 3>Party now.</v>

1223
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.760
<v Speaker 2>So I think sometimes they do it when </v>
<v Speaker 2>that day Reuben guy shows up.</v>

1224
00:52:08.761 --> 00:52:10.090
<v Speaker 2>It's very busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy though.</v>

1225
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.830
<v Speaker 2>He's off the walkies off the diva.</v>

1226
00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I understand that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

1227
00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>

1228
00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:17.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can have a dialogue with people on</v>

1229
00:52:17.471 --> 00:52:20.080
<v Speaker 3>the left and showcase that we actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>do care about the environment,</v>

1230
00:52:20.081 --> 00:52:23.380
<v Speaker 3>we're just not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not anti left on everything.</v>

1231
00:52:23.381 --> 00:52:26.680
<v Speaker 3>We just want to work with you guys on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual common sense solutions,</v>

1232
00:52:26.681 --> 00:52:27.514
<v Speaker 3>not what you guys are pushing but </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that maybe both sides can </v>

1233
00:52:29.741 --> 00:52:30.574
<v Speaker 3>agree on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I have found in my own college </v>

1234
00:52:31.631 --> 00:52:32.464
<v Speaker 3>campus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I go to the University of </v>

1235
00:52:32.861 --> 00:52:33.694
<v Speaker 3>Washington in Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that I've talked to a bunch of </v>

1236
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:37.990
<v Speaker 3>typical people who would show up to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>protest,</v>

1237
00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:41.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe even mtf up and they've found </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1238
00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:43.180
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just kind of fun.</v>

1239
00:52:43.181 --> 00:52:44.920
<v Speaker 3>There's a conservative who cares about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment.</v>

1240
00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:47.590
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know they existed.</v>

1241
00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.360
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they're everywhere.</v>

1242
00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:50.493
<v Speaker 3>Almost every conservative that you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever talked to or protested against </v>

1243
00:52:52.541 --> 00:52:53.374
<v Speaker 3>cares about the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we need to start having that </v>

1244
00:52:54.761 --> 00:52:55.594
<v Speaker 3>dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that slowly it can sort of </v>

1245
00:52:58.211 --> 00:53:00.220
<v Speaker 3>start to bring together some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>divide on call.</v>

1246
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that in a place like </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Washington,</v>

1247
00:53:03.161 --> 00:53:04.180
<v Speaker 2>they look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got Seattle there.</v>

1248
00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:05.014
<v Speaker 2>That's obviously progressive Palooza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would imagine there's so many </v>

1249
00:53:07.991 --> 00:53:11.440
<v Speaker 2>people there that lives suburban lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>and out there in nature and all of those</v>

1250
00:53:11.441 --> 00:53:13.540
<v Speaker 2>things where they had this strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>dichotomy.</v>

1251
00:53:13.541 --> 00:53:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Now they've been told that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans hate the environment,</v>

1252
00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:17.403
<v Speaker 2>they love the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also love freedom because they </v>

1253
00:53:19.151 --> 00:53:20.440
<v Speaker 2>want to be on their own land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that.</v>

1254
00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 2>So to me that's a very fertile ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a just the,</v>

1255
00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:23.973
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that the Pacific </v>
<v Speaker 2>northwest is probably the perfect place </v>

1256
00:53:26.341 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 2>to start using this as the incubator</v>

1257
00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.490
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of the old conservative leaders</v>

1258
00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:32.383
<v Speaker 3>in Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're pioneers for environmental </v>

1259
00:53:34.521 --> 00:53:38.180
<v Speaker 3>progress nationally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got former governor Dan Evans who</v>

1260
00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.550
<v Speaker 3>created the Department of the ecology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was what was,</v>

1261
00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the EPA was founded after,</v>

1262
00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.393
<v Speaker 3>which is supposed to be a limited </v>
<v Speaker 3>government but important agency that </v>

1263
00:53:46.641 --> 00:53:49.460
<v Speaker 3>only stepped in when necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone far past those bounds.</v>

1264
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:52.280
<v Speaker 3>But that's what he had done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was a conservative.</v>

1265
00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:53.443
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the public land has been named </v>
<v Speaker 3>after him because of all of his </v>

1266
00:53:55.641 --> 00:53:58.700
<v Speaker 3>contribution to conservation in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

1267
00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:02.450
<v Speaker 3>You've got a lot of former senators and </v>
<v Speaker 3>congressmen and women,</v>

1268
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.990
<v Speaker 3>even some current ones who are leading </v>
<v Speaker 3>on these issues from the Republican side</v>

1269
00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:09.920
<v Speaker 3>because they realize they live on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>land there in the mountains there,</v>

1270
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:10.943
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the cascades and the Olympics and </v>

1271
00:54:11.931 --> 00:54:13.460
<v Speaker 3>they really care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1272
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.770
<v Speaker 3>and I think that it's a different state </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

1273
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:18.620
<v Speaker 3>And then if you take away a Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very conservative state.</v>

1274
00:54:18.621 --> 00:54:20.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say that about a lot of states,</v>

1275
00:54:20.271 --> 00:54:21.890
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and their big cities,</v>

1276
00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:24.710
<v Speaker 3>but in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those mountainous,</v>

1277
00:54:24.711 --> 00:54:25.544
<v Speaker 3>rural areas that are constantly impacted</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the environment or they live in the </v>

1278
00:54:29.001 --> 00:54:30.140
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1279
00:54:30.141 --> 00:54:34.760
<v Speaker 3>itself are conservative people who want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have leadership on this issue,</v>

1280
00:54:34.761 --> 00:54:36.650
<v Speaker 3>but just don't really know where to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and only know,</v>

1281
00:54:36.651 --> 00:54:38.330
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the big government,</v>

1282
00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions that can happen.</v>

1283
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:42.260
<v Speaker 3>And you've got the Seattle mayor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1284
00:54:42.261 --> 00:54:45.680
<v Speaker 3>and the Washington governor who claim to</v>
<v Speaker 3>care about the environment,</v>

1285
00:54:45.681 --> 00:54:46.514
<v Speaker 3>but nothing ever happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of people are sick of </v>

1286
00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:49.184
<v Speaker 3>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in a state like Washington </v>

1287
00:54:50.151 --> 00:54:51.110
<v Speaker 3>where the environment matters.</v>

1288
00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:52.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where are you at with trump on all </v>

1289
00:54:53.561 --> 00:54:54.460
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

1290
00:54:54.461 --> 00:54:56.190
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about climate,</v>

1291
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:58.480
<v Speaker 2>the Paris climate accords.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got us out of that.</v>

1292
00:54:58.481 --> 00:55:00.460
<v Speaker 2>So I sent your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're happy about that.</v>

1293
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.730
<v Speaker 2>His regulation situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're cutting something and it</v>

1294
00:55:03.731 --> 00:55:04.564
<v Speaker 2>changes all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they're cutting a ton of </v>

1295
00:55:05.591 --> 00:55:07.870
<v Speaker 2>regulation for every new one that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>pass,</v>

1296
00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:11.830
<v Speaker 2>I think you're generally for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know you're not a big trump guy.</v>

1297
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.210
<v Speaker 2>That's probably putting it mildly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1298
00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where,</v>

1299
00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.960
<v Speaker 2>where do you think he falls on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental stuff?</v>

1300
00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:18.563
<v Speaker 3>I think I actually haven't been as </v>
<v Speaker 3>annoyed with his environmental policies </v>

1301
00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:22.914
<v Speaker 3>as I would have thought before he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>elected or even right after he was </v>

1302
00:55:25.431 --> 00:55:26.700
<v Speaker 3>elected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is a good thing.</v>

1303
00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.920
<v Speaker 3>But I think part of the problem that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>falls into,</v>

1304
00:55:28.921 --> 00:55:31.020
<v Speaker 3>which is what most conservatives fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>

1305
00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:36.380
<v Speaker 3>is that they criticize the laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might like deregulate,</v>

1306
00:55:36.451 --> 00:55:38.940
<v Speaker 3>they might remove some protections or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1307
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.760
<v Speaker 3>but what are they going to do as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer?</v>

1308
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.330
<v Speaker 3>What's going to be their solution that </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't anti-left or that,</v>

1309
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1310
00:55:46.021 --> 00:55:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the solution is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting.</v>

1311
00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to replace that </v>
<v Speaker 3>with?</v>

1312
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.200
<v Speaker 3>And I think that trump hasn't done a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good enough job,</v>

1313
00:55:52.201 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 3>just like most conservatives recently of</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

1314
00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:57.563
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swap of policy in terms of if you're </v>

1315
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:04.080
<v Speaker 3>going to remove the protection here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to protect it on the,</v>

1316
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1317
00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:06.070
<v Speaker 2>So what is that answer that you'd like?</v>

1318
00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:07.693
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see a and all of the </v>

1319
00:56:08.961 --> 00:56:12.490
<v Speaker 3>above energy policy that is not focused </v>
<v Speaker 3>on um,</v>

1320
00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:13.423
<v Speaker 3>subsidies or tax breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to remove those from the clean </v>

1321
00:56:16.731 --> 00:56:18.740
<v Speaker 3>energy or just from the energy sector in</v>
<v Speaker 3>general.</v>

1322
00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I was actually not a fan of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of trump's tariff on solar because while</v>

1323
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:27.790
<v Speaker 3>they have a ton of tax breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so does oil and coal and we need to just</v>

1324
00:56:27.791 --> 00:56:28.624
<v Speaker 3>put them on an even level playing field </v>
<v Speaker 3>because consumers care about the free </v>

1325
00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:32.560
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also have the free market compete and if</v>

1326
00:56:32.561 --> 00:56:36.400
<v Speaker 3>soar is the worst thing in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just being propped up by subsidies,</v>

1327
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.170
<v Speaker 3>let's have the free market take it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the coal,</v>

1328
00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:40.870
<v Speaker 3>if calls done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's have colgate taken out.</v>

1329
00:56:40.871 --> 00:56:44.920
<v Speaker 3>The free market needs to just dominate </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the energy sector.</v>

1330
00:56:44.921 --> 00:56:46.980
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the president needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus on that.</v>

1331
00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Where would you leave a lot of that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state?</v>

1332
00:56:48.901 --> 00:56:51.000
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place like California where the sun is</v>

1333
00:56:51.001 --> 00:56:51.990
<v Speaker 2>shining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1334
00:56:51.991 --> 00:56:54.720
<v Speaker 2>367 days a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1335
00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:55.643
<v Speaker 2>you'd be for California just doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it feels is right and related </v>

1336
00:56:57.961 --> 00:56:58.740
<v Speaker 2>to solar.</v>

1337
00:56:58.740 --> 00:56:59.573
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it should be up to the states </v>

1338
00:57:00.301 --> 00:57:01.950
<v Speaker 3>and their different states that need </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things,</v>

1339
00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:02.784
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Iowa and different states in the </v>

1340
00:57:04.351 --> 00:57:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Midwest get a lot of wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1341
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:07.110
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1342
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when energy makes a ton of sense.</v>

1343
00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:10.283
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are states like Washington that </v>

1344
00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:14.040
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of water and hydropower makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of sense.</v>

1345
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Arizona and Texas are two of the leading</v>
<v Speaker 3>states on solar.</v>

1346
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:20.580
<v Speaker 3>They're conservative states and usually </v>
<v Speaker 3>solar is identified as a liberal thing,</v>

1347
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:24.030
<v Speaker 3>but those governors have totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>implemented solar rvs.</v>

1348
00:57:24.031 --> 00:57:26.250
<v Speaker 3>They know it works and they know it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective in their states.</v>

1349
00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Solar would not really work that well in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seattle.</v>

1350
00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it just depends on the state.</v>

1351
00:57:31.021 --> 00:57:31.854
<v Speaker 3>And I think that unless the free market </v>
<v Speaker 3>can decide that and have different </v>

1352
00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:36.810
<v Speaker 3>states figure out what they need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1353
00:57:36.811 --> 00:57:39.100
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be really frustrating </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

1354
00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.013
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be really frustrating for </v>

1355
00:57:40.681 --> 00:57:41.514
<v Speaker 3>states like Texas and Arizona and </v>
<v Speaker 3>California who now are going to have to </v>

1356
00:57:44.311 --> 00:57:47.580
<v Speaker 3>pay a premium for solar when it's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>really effective there.</v>

1357
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:50.820
<v Speaker 3>And now there's a tariff on it and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary tariff.</v>

1358
00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.590
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1359
00:57:52.591 --> 00:57:53.460
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they gonna do?</v>

1360
00:57:53.461 --> 00:57:54.294
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have to figure out a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different way to get their energy for </v>

1361
00:57:56.851 --> 00:57:59.070
<v Speaker 3>those areas that they're losing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>solar from.</v>

1362
00:57:59.071 --> 00:58:01.110
<v Speaker 3>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and solar panels,</v>

1363
00:58:01.111 --> 00:58:03.180
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the ones that are already </v>
<v Speaker 3>there can just stay there.</v>

1364
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:05.430
<v Speaker 3>They have like a 10 year lifespan a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the time.</v>

1365
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.473
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of them needs to be replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if there's a new tariff that's </v>

1366
00:58:07.921 --> 00:58:09.810
<v Speaker 3>damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that it just needs to be left</v>

1367
00:58:09.811 --> 00:58:14.130
<v Speaker 3>up to the states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it also needs to be a lot of</v>

1368
00:58:14.131 --> 00:58:16.350
<v Speaker 3>deregulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less subsidies,</v>

1369
00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.180
<v Speaker 3>less tax breaks on the energy side.</v>

1370
00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a couple of minutes ago you mentioned</v>

1371
00:58:19.731 --> 00:58:22.190
<v Speaker 2>that the EPA has gone well past its </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandate.</v>

1372
00:58:22.191 --> 00:58:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is an interesting one to,</v>

1373
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:25.703
<v Speaker 2>to sort of end on because I think it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good place to start when you're talking </v>

1374
00:58:29.241 --> 00:58:30.074
<v Speaker 2>to people because everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you talk to the average </v>

1375
00:58:31.521 --> 00:58:32.354
<v Speaker 2>person that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wants to do good by the </v>

1376
00:58:34.371 --> 00:58:35.204
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they automatically think the EPA is </v>

1377
00:58:36.711 --> 00:58:37.401
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1378
00:58:37.401 --> 00:58:40.220
<v Speaker 2>It just environmental protection agency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds good.</v>

1379
00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.610
<v Speaker 2>How could that possibly be bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that actually mean?</v>

1380
00:58:43.611 --> 00:58:47.570
<v Speaker 2>That they've gone beyond their original </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandate and why does it keep growing and</v>

1381
00:58:47.571 --> 00:58:48.280
<v Speaker 2>growing and grow?</v>

1382
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:51.160
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to enforce the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not create the law.</v>

1383
00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.233
<v Speaker 3>And the EPA has gone to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are creating their own laws and </v>

1384
00:58:56.621 --> 00:59:00.340
<v Speaker 3>they had been incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly regulatory,</v>

1385
00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:01.403
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have not helped the environment at </v>

1386
00:59:04.091 --> 00:59:04.924
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they're supposed to do is enforce </v>

1387
00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.550
<v Speaker 3>what Congress passes and what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>American people want.</v>

1388
00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:11.790
<v Speaker 3>And environmental protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

1389
00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:15.220
<v Speaker 3>some Republicans put together a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing coastal barrier,</v>

1390
00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:16.323
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resiliency act while Reagan was </v>

1391
00:59:17.891 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 3>president and the EPA enforces that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the EPA is supposed to do,</v>

1392
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.590
<v Speaker 3>not create their own regulations that </v>
<v Speaker 3>says you can't do this.</v>

1393
00:59:24.591 --> 00:59:25.970
<v Speaker 3>You can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do this.</v>

1394
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Let that be up to the states and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>local areas and if it needs to happen on</v>

1395
00:59:29.091 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 3>the national level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what type of a vote on it.</v>

1396
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:31.813
<v Speaker 3>And I think the EPA has become more of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>punishment organization rather than a </v>

1397
00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:38.120
<v Speaker 3>let's help the environment and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to do the right thing.</v>

1398
00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and only enforce the law.</v>

1399
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:43.040
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not become that at all.</v>

1400
00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that being said,</v>

1401
00:59:44.811 --> 00:59:46.100
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they enforce the law.</v>

1402
00:59:46.101 --> 00:59:49.400
<v Speaker 3>So those things need to stay in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just remove that,</v>

1403
00:59:49.401 --> 00:59:53.450
<v Speaker 3>but they have created their own really </v>
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary regulatory reforms that have</v>

1404
00:59:53.451 --> 00:59:53.970
<v Speaker 3>just not worked.</v>

1405
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:54.803
<v Speaker 2>Is that just the best argument for small</v>
<v Speaker 2>government in general that we just </v>

1406
00:59:56.851 --> 00:59:57.684
<v Speaker 2>create these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these entities that are well </v>

1407
00:59:59.911 --> 01:00:00.900
<v Speaker 2>intentioned?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually?</v>

1408
01:00:00.901 --> 01:00:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I think usually most of them are well </v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

1409
01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:04.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>department of education sounds good.</v>

1410
01:00:04.321 --> 01:00:06.180
<v Speaker 2>We're going to educate people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental protective,</v>

1411
01:00:06.181 --> 01:00:09.180
<v Speaker 2>we're going to predict the environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these are usually well intentioned.</v>

1412
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:10.223
<v Speaker 2>But then just because of the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government works because of gridlock in </v>

1413
01:00:12.751 --> 01:00:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of all the money poured in,</v>

1414
01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:17.850
<v Speaker 2>they become these albatrosses that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've pretty much never,</v>

1415
01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were intended to be.</v>

1416
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:20.263
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that kind of leads into a </v>

1417
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:24.380
<v Speaker 3>bigger issue as of how do we keep that </v>
<v Speaker 3>from happening.</v>

1418
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:25.483
<v Speaker 3>Because I think most people will agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there needs to be some sort of </v>

1419
01:00:28.131 --> 01:00:28.964
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not just going to be governed by </v>

1420
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:31.063
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to have some sort of government </v>

1421
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it needs to be held accountable.</v>

1422
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.433
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know how often they need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at where these agencies had been </v>

1423
01:00:38.751 --> 01:00:39.584
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but obviously a lot of that have gone </v>

1424
01:00:40.581 --> 01:00:43.730
<v Speaker 3>way past what they need to be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Department of Education is a perfect</v>

1425
01:00:43.731 --> 01:00:48.500
<v Speaker 3>example of really actually ruining the </v>
<v Speaker 3>education system in the United States.</v>

1426
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 3>And EPA has gone way past what it needs </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be doing.</v>

1427
01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:52.663
<v Speaker 3>We need to have a way to check on these </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas frequently and make sure that </v>

1428
01:00:56.541 --> 01:01:00.620
<v Speaker 3>they're sticking to what they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>created to do and not going past that,</v>

1429
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and being held accountable for it.</v>

1430
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.313
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It definitely happens with every new </v>

1431
01:01:06.051 --> 01:01:08.540
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing really ever changes.</v>

1432
01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:12.410
<v Speaker 3>And I think that it's trump and every </v>
<v Speaker 3>president from here on out that needs to</v>

1433
01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.890
<v Speaker 3>analyze when they get into office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where these agencies are at,</v>

1434
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.620
<v Speaker 3>how we can cut down or increase if </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's necessary,</v>

1435
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:19.483
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that can be a really </v>

1436
01:01:20.721 --> 01:01:21.554
<v Speaker 3>good answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a bigger answer is to have state </v>

1437
01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:25.304
<v Speaker 3>governments and local leaders and local </v>
<v Speaker 3>governments as well as businesses do </v>

1438
01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:31.700
<v Speaker 3>their own thing on these issues to prove</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the government,</v>

1439
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:34.400
<v Speaker 3>the federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we don't need restrictions,</v>

1440
01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.293
<v Speaker 3>we don't need regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do it ourselves and we're far </v>

1441
01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:38.444
<v Speaker 3>more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's the answer </v>

1442
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:42.350
<v Speaker 3>rather than waiting on Congress to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1443
01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Well that is a great closing statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>

1444
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:48.340
<v Speaker 2>But I got to ask you one more because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so obvious to me.</v>

1445
01:01:48.341 --> 01:01:49.174
<v Speaker 2>You've become a master at what what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>care about and you're trying to do good </v>

1446
01:01:51.881 --> 01:01:55.240
<v Speaker 2>work and that you actually are affecting</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1447
01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.800
<v Speaker 2>So what year are you running for office?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give me a ballpark.</v>

1448
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Maybe 2036</v>

1449
01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.193
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually when I've asked a few people </v>

1450
01:02:04.161 --> 01:02:05.300
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pumped the question.</v>

1451
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:10.810
<v Speaker 2>You did not punt for more on Benjy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his budding political campaign.</v>

1452
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Check them out on twitter at Benji </v>
<v Speaker 2>backer.</v>
