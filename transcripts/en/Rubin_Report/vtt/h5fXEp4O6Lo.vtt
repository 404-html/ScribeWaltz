1
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.683
<v Speaker 2>There is a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to talk to you guys about this </v>

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.061
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you probably know,</v>

4
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I was in Israel last week where I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>invited to speak at a video conference.</v>

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.243
<v Speaker 2>The remainder of the week was spent </v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering the streets talking to people </v>

6
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 2>about peace and eating ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts of Hummus.</v>

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.753
<v Speaker 2>Spending most of my time in Tel Aviv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw people have pretty much every </v>

8
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>

9
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity and nationality,</v>

10
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 2>living side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard Hebrew,</v>

11
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>

12
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 2>French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish,</v>

13
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>German,</v>

14
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:33.861
<v Speaker 2>and several other languages being spoken</v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously in restaurants in cafes.</v>

15
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 2>I saw a coexistence in a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that has very little of it.</v>

16
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.843
<v Speaker 2>I also spent a day in Jerusalem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you saw the video that we posted a </v>

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.833
<v Speaker 2>couple of days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to show how close these </v>

18
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:44.784
<v Speaker 2>religious sites are and give a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>context to an extremely small yet </v>

19
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 2>complex city walking through the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>city of Jerusalem.</v>

20
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.373
<v Speaker 2>I explored the Jewish and Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarters and stop for falafel and the </v>

21
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Arab quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt it was important not just to talk</v>

22
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 2>about these places as we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually to live them as well.</v>

23
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.783
<v Speaker 2>I exited the Old City at the Damascus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gate where literally a day before a Jew </v>

24
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:06.984
<v Speaker 2>had been stabbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While there was no doubt the </v>

25
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.294
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood was tense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was also a feeling that this was </v>

26
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life goes on.</v>

27
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.993
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard about the San Bernardino </v>

28
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 2>terrorist attacks while on the beach in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel.</v>

29
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:19.284
<v Speaker 2>I can't really explain to you guys how </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly surreal it was to be so far </v>

30
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:23.904
<v Speaker 2>away from something so horrific </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening 60 miles away from where I </v>

31
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 2>live while I was 7,600</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles away from home.</v>

32
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.223
<v Speaker 2>Adding to the surreal feeling was that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in the Epi center of a country that </v>

33
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 2>deals with terrorism in some form or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another pretty much every day.</v>

34
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.263
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly I had people asking me what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like to be in America with all our </v>

35
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 2>mass shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world felt completely flipped on its</v>

36
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:46.554
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the 14 hour plane ride back to Los </v>

37
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.013
<v Speaker 2>Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read what's left by my guest this </v>

38
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicole and nick is a writer for time.</v>

39
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Spectator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the observer and standpoint,</v>

40
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.543
<v Speaker 2>his first book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's left is an absolute must read if </v>

41
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 2>you dig what we do here though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's left was written in 2017.</v>

42
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:03.594
<v Speaker 2>Nick absolutely nails so much of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lunacy we've been talking about on the </v>

43
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:08.094
<v Speaker 2>left these days from their dishonest </v>
<v Speaker 2>tactics of lying about opponents' views </v>

44
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 2>to aligning themselves with people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are just as easily have them killed.</v>

45
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.343
<v Speaker 2>He goes on a journey through history to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show how the far left has so often </v>

46
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 2>strengthened the very ideas that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>purport to be against.</v>

47
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 2>There were so many passages of the book </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I felt like could have been written</v>

48
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:26.994
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was almost like reading </v>

49
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 2>something from the future.</v>

50
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 2>He nailed the regressive left before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>term was even out there.</v>

51
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.083
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of the regressives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't think I was going to get </v>

52
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 2>through a show without mentioning them </v>
<v Speaker 2>data?</v>

53
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not gonna happen.</v>

54
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.303
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the issues I've called them out </v>

55
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 2>on consistently is that if they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop smearing,</v>

56
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 2>the liberals willing to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic extremism,</v>

57
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to hand our future to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the far right.</v>

58
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.833
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing this right this very second</v>
<v Speaker 2>across Europe as far right parties are </v>

59
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:52.734
<v Speaker 2>winning elections and gaining in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>polls from France to Belgium to Sweden </v>

60
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:56.574
<v Speaker 2>and more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is clearly coming to the American </v>

61
00:02:58.381 --> 00:02:59.214
<v Speaker 2>shores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

62
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.213
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As Donald trump just this week called </v>

63
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 2>for denying Muslims entry into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

64
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Obviously this is idiotic over the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ridiculous,</v>

65
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.203
<v Speaker 2>but it can only exist in a climate where</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear of real discussion has been </v>

66
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:14.284
<v Speaker 2>stifled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we aren't afraid of talking about </v>

67
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Islamism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the difference between people</v>

68
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:20.254
<v Speaker 2>and doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we can finally have an honest </v>

69
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 2>conversation about refugees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration and everything else,</v>

70
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.063
<v Speaker 2>but if we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the regressives are doing this very </v>

71
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:29.644
<v Speaker 2>second by making no distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are trying to talk about </v>

72
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 2>serious issues versus people who trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>on fear,</v>

73
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 2>then we help the real xenophobes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>silence the reformers.</v>

74
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.033
<v Speaker 2>Even as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always loved John f Kennedy's famous </v>

75
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 2>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have nothing to fear but fear itself.</v>

76
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.343
<v Speaker 2>It's lofty and big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it hits something that is extremely </v>

77
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:50.434
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes fear and things is scarier </v>

78
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:53.764
<v Speaker 2>than the actual thing itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not to say that radical Islam is </v>

79
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.733
<v Speaker 2>scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also feed that fear if we don't </v>

80
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:01.054
<v Speaker 2>deal with it honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that we live in a time when people </v>

81
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 2>are incredibly fearful and much of it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>with good reason,</v>

82
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 2>as we've seen the spread of an evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology with no signs of letting up,</v>

83
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean we have to be afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak out against it or silence those</v>

84
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 2>who dare to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

85
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 2>of course it means the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fear is what the regressives and the far</v>

86
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:22.954
<v Speaker 2>right are both going to use to splinter </v>
<v Speaker 2>us against each other so they can gain </v>

87
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

88
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 2>The world is in a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fearful moment,</v>

89
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This very second,</v>

90
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 2>we can either give into our worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulses or try to be better.</v>

91
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure you guys know which side</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to choose.</v>

92
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 2>As we sat in a packed restaurant in Tel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aviv,</v>

93
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I asked a friend how he feels about all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stabbings without missing a beat.</v>

94
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to keep living.</v>

95
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.353
<v Speaker 2>We have no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we could all use a little of </v>

96
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.204
<v Speaker 2>that spirit right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not give into fear fed to us by </v>

97
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 2>terrorists or fear fed to us by </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians.</v>

98
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.773
<v Speaker 2>Let's keep fighting because if we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice is exactly what we're going to </v>

99
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:00.034
<v Speaker 2>give up.</v>

100
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I guess this week is a writer for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Observer,</v>

101
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.390
<v Speaker 2>the spectator time and standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's authored two books.</v>

102
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.000
<v Speaker 2>You can't read this book and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

103
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 2>I just read what's left and I'm thrilled</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have him here.</v>

104
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Nicole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and welcome to the show mark.</v>

105
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.103
<v Speaker 2>So Nick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling you right before we </v>

106
00:05:18.921 --> 00:05:20.600
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read the book,</v>

107
00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:21.434
<v Speaker 2>so all of your thoughts in what's left </v>
<v Speaker 2>are there right at the tip of my brain </v>

108
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:27.110
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I loved it.</v>

109
00:05:27.111 --> 00:05:32.111
<v Speaker 2>I have been so in this regressive left </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing this far left that your whole,</v>

110
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.950
<v Speaker 2>your whole book is about and you saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You saw it early.</v>

111
00:05:36.951 --> 00:05:39.020
<v Speaker 2>So I want to get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we start,</v>

112
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.153
<v Speaker 2>give me some of your liberal credentials</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I want people to know that </v>

113
00:05:43.371 --> 00:05:44.204
<v Speaker 2>you're a lefty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because we're going to talk shit </v>

114
00:05:46.371 --> 00:05:47.204
<v Speaker 2>about the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want people to know you're an </v>

115
00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:48.614
<v Speaker 2>actual lefty,</v>

116
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.273
<v Speaker 3>Britain and Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't call me a liberal </v>

117
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left</v>

118
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.580
<v Speaker 2>a way for whatever his problems and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are manifest and man,</v>

119
00:06:03.581 --> 00:06:04.414
<v Speaker 2>if bold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you didn't really cover it at </v>

120
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:07.244
<v Speaker 2>great length in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to believe in things like tourism </v>

121
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.043
<v Speaker 2>and antique fascism in feminism to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extent in being a part of the party of </v>

122
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it used to have some idea of what to</v>

123
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:23.324
<v Speaker 2>do with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I gradually realized looking around </v>

124
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.614
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this was no longer the case that as </v>

125
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:29.834
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to post it in sort of </v>

126
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

127
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 2>a road rubbish terms really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this know I didn't leave less,</v>

128
00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less meat,</v>

129
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.980
<v Speaker 2>less somebody's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

130
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no longer a universal leftwing</v>

131
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 2>mess with which meant that people around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world could say,</v>

132
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.933
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're oppressed and we're oppressed by </v>

133
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 2>heaviest reactionary forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The less wind resources.</v>

134
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.513
<v Speaker 2>So being in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a bunch of my guests have been </v>

135
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.323
<v Speaker 2>lefties in the UK that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are talking about the same issues </v>

136
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:00.584
<v Speaker 2>that you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is going on in the UK that I think </v>

137
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 2>woke you guys up to this before it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>awoken in America?</v>

138
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Because really here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only in the last year.</v>

139
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 2>I think that that liberals are waking up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what's going on on our side.</v>

140
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever happens in America happens in </v>

141
00:07:20.131 --> 00:07:24.270
<v Speaker 3>Brooklyn and your five years later for </v>
<v Speaker 3>one since the other way round,</v>

142
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.403
<v Speaker 3>I think that really big arguments and </v>
<v Speaker 3>big battles we've had in Brisbane in </v>

143
00:07:28.171 --> 00:07:31.350
<v Speaker 3>particular all now coming to America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

144
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.213
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

145
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 3>the Alice has been reversed the bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

146
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.590
<v Speaker 3>there has been the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

147
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 3>for Roche rouse head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm pleased about because,</v>

148
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.093
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a on polemicists system that Swiss </v>

149
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.860
<v Speaker 3>blendable I don't believe that the being</v>
<v Speaker 3>pc and nice and kind and gentle is a way</v>

150
00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:54.330
<v Speaker 3>of sorting out problems is often a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>of covering them up.</v>

151
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.300
<v Speaker 3>But there have been huge rounds in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain,</v>

152
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really since nine slash 11 in my case,</v>

153
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 3>since the Iraq war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which mouse might seem rather wrong,</v>

154
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.320
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

155
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.653
<v Speaker 3>your older may remember your faculty to </v>
<v Speaker 3>credit viewers may remember the won't </v>

156
00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.234
<v Speaker 3>set on the saying was the enemy if left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left wing is used to campaign in favor </v>

157
00:08:18.451 --> 00:08:21.920
<v Speaker 3>of rights for the Kurds and pools have </v>
<v Speaker 3>damaged Sadam Hussein and fashion is.</v>

158
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.720
<v Speaker 3>So in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't nine slash 11,</v>

159
00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:28.260
<v Speaker 3>it was 2003 with the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I says,</v>

160
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.771
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

161
00:08:28.771 --> 00:08:29.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

162
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 3>what happened to all my youth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are,</v>

163
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.140
<v Speaker 3>why are you European?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lester's food reason to,</v>

164
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.003
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>

165
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.003
<v Speaker 3>You never need a good reason to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are plenty of good reasons for </v>

166
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:41.500
<v Speaker 3>post George W Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

167
00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:42.334
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

168
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

169
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:44.803
<v Speaker 3>why was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was simply no concern for courage </v>

170
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:48.894
<v Speaker 3>in the Ra for socialist in the wrongful </v>
<v Speaker 3>trade unions from the rock who had been </v>

171
00:08:52.561 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 3>until the late eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

172
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be demos to bound them.</v>

173
00:08:59.131 --> 00:08:59.964
<v Speaker 3>That'd be petitioning to that support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've kind of at my parents home or </v>

174
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:05.350
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you want to go,</v>

175
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened there?</v>

176
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 3>And once you start asking that question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very simple question,</v>

177
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.270
<v Speaker 3>who are your friends who to use old left</v>
<v Speaker 3>wing Lang Lang,</v>

178
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.490
<v Speaker 3>joy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your comrades,</v>

179
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you sticking up for whatever kind of</v>

180
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Chris would you want to be of American </v>
<v Speaker 3>policy or public policy?</v>

181
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:22.360
<v Speaker 3>And our piece again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opt for an interview.</v>

182
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 3>There are always good grounds because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>American British policy who you actually</v>

183
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:28.554
<v Speaker 3>supporting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you get some rather ugly </v>

184
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:31.524
<v Speaker 3>answers and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find a source of great vacuum on or </v>

185
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:37.254
<v Speaker 3>most of the left and many good left wing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is on most of the left were a principal </v>

186
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 3>ideology or to be.</v>

187
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right there.</v>

188
00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:47.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean you hit a lot of the books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the book deals directly with</v>

189
00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:48.424
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and how it woke you up as you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sat in the horrible things that Saddam </v>

190
00:09:50.921 --> 00:09:55.040
<v Speaker 2>was doing and the horrible things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bath party was up to.</v>

191
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so before we get into that,</v>

192
00:09:58.001 --> 00:10:01.820
<v Speaker 2>because I was actually surprised how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much of your journey was through Iraq.</v>

193
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.370
<v Speaker 2>But before we get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>

194
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.443
<v Speaker 2>the phrase regressive left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was coined by marginalized and </v>

195
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:07.964
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really taken off here and end at </v>

196
00:10:09.641 --> 00:10:11.530
<v Speaker 2>the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the beginning of the book,</v>

197
00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:14.890
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned that you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily have a word for this and you</v>

198
00:10:14.891 --> 00:10:17.260
<v Speaker 2>said you didn't want to get too hung up </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of onwards.</v>

199
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Do you like the phrase regressive left?</v>

200
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

201
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:30.260
<v Speaker 3>a waltz graph came out in 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm might go,</v>

202
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm old.</v>

203
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No revolution like Kaboosh kids.</v>

204
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.413
<v Speaker 3>The reason I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the French progressive lesson is </v>

205
00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:41.774
<v Speaker 3>absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I didn't put a name to </v>

206
00:10:44.901 --> 00:10:45.734
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

207
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.840
<v Speaker 3>you can say a very easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's just a fall next,</v>

208
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who used to be Marxist,</v>

209
00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Leninist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trotskyists,</v>

210
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.240
<v Speaker 3>starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have you.</v>

211
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.350
<v Speaker 3>But here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you interrogate these attitudes,</v>

212
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.810
<v Speaker 3>they go way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

213
00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:03.644
<v Speaker 3>way into the mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's people who don't consider </v>

214
00:11:05.571 --> 00:11:07.120
<v Speaker 3>themselves less than at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

215
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.963
<v Speaker 3>typically in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure this is true in America as </v>

216
00:11:09.141 --> 00:11:10.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I've seen,</v>

217
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.110
<v Speaker 3>it's people in broadcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's people in universities,</v>

218
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.890
<v Speaker 3>people in schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's people in publishing.</v>

219
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.910
<v Speaker 3>It's people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

220
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.000
<v Speaker 3>you had to define themselves and quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorable,</v>

221
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.120
<v Speaker 3>but then have a load of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of baggage on them,</v>

222
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.580
<v Speaker 3>the terrible ideas we've started on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>far left and,</v>

223
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.493
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what grows people wilds in </v>

224
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Britain.</v>

225
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.073
<v Speaker 3>But this book was because I wasn't just </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about how some people on the </v>

226
00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:43.700
<v Speaker 3>friends and all sorts of talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people here in Britain will say,</v>

227
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:48.701
<v Speaker 3>BBC site people who never considered </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself extreme all with themselves,</v>

228
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.010
<v Speaker 3>models and new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say,</v>

229
00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:51.844
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are ideas that began on the phone </v>

230
00:11:54.451 --> 00:11:55.284
<v Speaker 3>and that it's okay to go along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>great dreams and movements that want to </v>

231
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.190
<v Speaker 3>subsidize the women kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hadn't sexuals kill Jews,</v>

232
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.213
<v Speaker 3>kill any Muslim who have his or her own </v>
<v Speaker 3>free will decides to change their </v>

233
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:12.250
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no god,</v>

234
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:15.700
<v Speaker 3>there is no our tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're getting along with all of this.</v>

235
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.040
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't matter if it was gas six </v>
<v Speaker 3>grade,</v>

236
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 3>what masters is permeating the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>

237
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

238
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

239
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.243
<v Speaker 3>a spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what growth people wild </v>

240
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.403
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to me that was so obviously true and </v>

241
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be true of as American as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

242
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.203
<v Speaker 2>so you hit on a lot there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So partly it seems to me that it's a </v>

243
00:12:39.121 --> 00:12:40.800
<v Speaker 2>little bit like the phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

244
00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:41.720
<v Speaker 2>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

245
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.720
<v Speaker 2>the road to hell is paved with good </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentions that these people,</v>

246
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:47.970
<v Speaker 2>and I think you hit on this advantage </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these people,</v>

247
00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:48.804
<v Speaker 2>they have good intentions in that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want extra war and we have had a </v>

248
00:12:53.341 --> 00:12:55.080
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of our countries,</v>

249
00:12:55.081 --> 00:12:57.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You in the UK and in America we've had,</v>

250
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.970
<v Speaker 2>we have had plenty of ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary wars.</v>

251
00:13:02.971 --> 00:13:04.800
<v Speaker 2>We've done all kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drone strikes,</v>

252
00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:08.340
<v Speaker 2>all of these things that we on the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not thrilled with,</v>

253
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.073
<v Speaker 2>but you make a really good argument for </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the alternative that we </v>

254
00:13:13.921 --> 00:13:14.754
<v Speaker 2>basically just give up on all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that live under these horrible </v>

255
00:13:18.151 --> 00:13:18.984
<v Speaker 2>theocracies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what put these people in the </v>

256
00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:23.100
<v Speaker 2>far left in bed with some really </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible people.</v>

257
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also a,</v>

258
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.220
<v Speaker 3>if you could get a time machine and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the future,</v>

259
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.100
<v Speaker 3>say 50 years into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are bound to be all kinds of ideas</v>

260
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.943
<v Speaker 3>are accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The objects on the fringes of American </v>

261
00:13:40.911 --> 00:13:43.400
<v Speaker 3>society at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

262
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.520
<v Speaker 3>all your great panggang drums in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>media,</v>

263
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.383
<v Speaker 3>Time magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York Times barely even think about </v>

264
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.313
<v Speaker 3>will be the common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever age that applies to paddle </v>

265
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.433
<v Speaker 3>ideas as well as good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A really bad idea started on the far </v>

266
00:13:59.241 --> 00:14:00.074
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would even say it wasn't even less </v>

267
00:14:00.951 --> 00:14:03.740
<v Speaker 3>wind at all after the collapse of </v>
<v Speaker 3>communism,</v>

268
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.813
<v Speaker 3>after the end of socialist and members,</v>
<v Speaker 3>socialism defines what it means to be a </v>

269
00:14:08.631 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 3>left winger for a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

270
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.860
<v Speaker 3>some fruits are not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not all girls.</v>

271
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Then somebody there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people.</v>

272
00:14:17.061 --> 00:14:20.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>noam is a classic example to me who have</v>

273
00:14:20.631 --> 00:14:24.770
<v Speaker 3>that same spirit but no longer have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology they can believe in.</v>

274
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.083
<v Speaker 3>And so what did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still just send anyone who is </v>

275
00:14:30.711 --> 00:14:34.880
<v Speaker 3>against the West can't be all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who is against the west,</v>

276
00:14:34.881 --> 00:14:35.714
<v Speaker 3>it has to be the West fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all the root cause to use a phrase </v>

277
00:14:40.191 --> 00:14:44.690
<v Speaker 3>that's been repeated to and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly find people who call themselves</v>

278
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.930
<v Speaker 3>radicals or progressive socialist </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminists going along with movements.</v>

279
00:14:50.841 --> 00:14:55.841
<v Speaker 3>We anti progressive and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Auntie radical anti women,</v>

280
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 3>anti gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti Semitic,</v>

281
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.273
<v Speaker 3>and she everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Auntie liberal in the classic sense </v>

282
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.323
<v Speaker 3>actually movements that have stepped out</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a liberal nightmare if you look at </v>

283
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 3>their effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because they're anti west,</v>

284
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.173
<v Speaker 3>that's all that matters is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no longer a positive program </v>

285
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.013
<v Speaker 3>would be laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just seize on any body who is </v>

286
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.230
<v Speaker 3>against America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

287
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.083
<v Speaker 3>against to you Sarah rather contentious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you can have an organist bath we </v>

288
00:15:20.011 --> 00:15:20.844
<v Speaker 3>want later against imperialism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that just stops on the </v>

289
00:15:24.151 --> 00:15:24.780
<v Speaker 3>extremes.</v>

290
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.780
<v Speaker 3>Like good ideas start off on the fringes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it comes into the main screen.</v>

291
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.500
<v Speaker 3>Now that's not wholly the faults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mainstream liberals,</v>

292
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 3>senior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never let drop your books off the whole.</v>

293
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oralis is off the hook.</v>

294
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>password is perfectly possible.</v>

295
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.450
<v Speaker 3>Action results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So terrible and not just in,</v>

296
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor countries.</v>

297
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about people in America?</v>

298
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.030
<v Speaker 3>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

299
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.430
<v Speaker 3>people in Britain?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about people in my country,</v>

300
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.293
<v Speaker 3>Muslim women are now being told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to go through a </v>

301
00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:59.450
<v Speaker 3>course?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is a free women in a free country,</v>

302
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.110
<v Speaker 3>not second class citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you don't have to have,</v>

303
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

304
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.080
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

305
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:08.020
<v Speaker 3>fear classic legal system saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence worth half that,</v>

306
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you as a white guy say that,</v>

307
00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:12.234
<v Speaker 2>then people go bananas and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing your views on that even though </v>

308
00:16:16.021 --> 00:16:19.080
<v Speaker 2>if you're the one that's abiding the </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws of your country,</v>

309
00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:20.190
<v Speaker 2>which is what they are governed by.</v>

310
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.930
<v Speaker 3>Well now I'm afraid to lose my country </v>
<v Speaker 3>is slightly worse than that.</v>

311
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a danger.</v>

312
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:27.683
<v Speaker 3>We're not quite there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll have parallel legal system will </v>

313
00:16:30.571 --> 00:16:33.430
<v Speaker 3>have a say up in civil case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>divorce cases,</v>

314
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.830
<v Speaker 3>big deals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

315
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Muslim woman will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

316
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.970
<v Speaker 3>seems quite content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say we can settle this to Shariyah cool,</v>

317
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.380
<v Speaker 3>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of racist.</v>

318
00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Is it not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you say to a woman,</v>

319
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 3>you have to go through a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

320
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.810
<v Speaker 3>All liberal opinion across Breslin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>across America,</v>

321
00:16:57.811 --> 00:17:02.360
<v Speaker 3>across the world who go wild sexism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New social needs is patreo police.</v>

322
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.273
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When that happens to a brown skinned </v>

323
00:17:04.051 --> 00:17:05.230
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

324
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Were you in the name of liberalism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all,</v>

325
00:17:09.721 --> 00:17:13.590
<v Speaker 3>we all create shaking the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the classic double standards of,</v>

326
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.840
<v Speaker 3>of predictable days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

327
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.630
<v Speaker 3>a white people have more rights and </v>
<v Speaker 3>white.</v>

328
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Certain people are more honest and brown</v>
<v Speaker 3>skinned people.</v>

329
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Kristen issue for how people are treated</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Saudi Arabia or Iran or,</v>

330
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.350
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

331
00:17:28.351 --> 00:17:30.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any other country with a uh,</v>

332
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an for me,</v>

333
00:17:32.621 --> 00:17:35.580
<v Speaker 3>I would say a unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>classic legal system.</v>

334
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.260
<v Speaker 3>It's here now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm already societies.</v>

335
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.473
<v Speaker 3>It does seem to be the liberal soul to </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide what type of liberalism they </v>

336
00:17:42.241 --> 00:17:43.074
<v Speaker 3>believe in July,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in liberalism means we've got </v>

337
00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:48.840
<v Speaker 3>equal rights and universal values or </v>
<v Speaker 3>does liberalism main.</v>

338
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 3>There's one law for one group and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>law for another group depending on their</v>

339
00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:53.694
<v Speaker 3>couch.</v>

340
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Does this part of this seem to you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the end game?</v>

341
00:17:57.321 --> 00:18:00.440
<v Speaker 2>This is the end result of identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

342
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.413
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going through right now in </v>

343
00:18:01.941 --> 00:18:02.774
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this really strong phase with identity </v>

344
00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:07.080
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

345
00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:07.923
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're all divided on sexuality and </v>

346
00:18:10.481 --> 00:18:11.314
<v Speaker 2>race and just every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that you can divide people on </v>

347
00:18:14.321 --> 00:18:15.154
<v Speaker 2>were divided on it right now and is part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this just that you saw the end game </v>

348
00:18:19.721 --> 00:18:21.400
<v Speaker 2>of all of this sorta before we did</v>

349
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.700
<v Speaker 3>your profit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>profit bibles or any of that.</v>

350
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.120
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a big,</v>

351
00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:35.954
<v Speaker 3>big vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Opens up at the end of the 20th century </v>

352
00:18:38.331 --> 00:18:40.580
<v Speaker 3>were first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said before,</v>

353
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.500
<v Speaker 3>it may not be so much in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Europe and the love of the world,</v>

354
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:46.334
<v Speaker 3>the collapse of socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the collapse in the belief of off the </v>

355
00:18:49.971 --> 00:18:54.030
<v Speaker 3>plan to call me of national society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all the sudden the clap,</v>

356
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:54.864
<v Speaker 3>so it kind of lung collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a marginalizing and flip real </v>

357
00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.980
<v Speaker 3>optimism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal locksmiths and just says,</v>

358
00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.030
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were universal human rights.</v>

359
00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter what your skin color </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

360
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter what your religion is.</v>

361
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.870
<v Speaker 3>You can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

362
00:19:08.871 --> 00:19:12.670
<v Speaker 3>it's my culture to oppress women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say that I was laughing.</v>

363
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.830
<v Speaker 3>You actually now like they laugh with </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and that's allowed.</v>

364
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.560
<v Speaker 3>It's identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sounds fun.</v>

365
00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Sounds Fun.</v>

366
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.143
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ain't going to last,</v>

367
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read these reports of black students.</v>

368
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.193
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think about history of a black </v>

369
00:19:27.051 --> 00:19:29.390
<v Speaker 3>oppression in America and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand them,</v>

370
00:19:29.391 --> 00:19:34.310
<v Speaker 3>nesting is kid's sake a bit nuts by </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity politics has and you think,</v>

371
00:19:34.311 --> 00:19:35.144
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

372
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.930
<v Speaker 3>let them have their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

373
00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.720
<v Speaker 3>that fuss by identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Politics has a hugely dog.</v>

374
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.583
<v Speaker 3>So [inaudible] you have no onset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in the people who say we're the </v>

375
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.490
<v Speaker 3>masters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are against identity.</v>

376
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:47.863
<v Speaker 3>We all the community leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all the mothers will a rabbi's </v>

377
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.180
<v Speaker 3>priests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We control this group,</v>

378
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:58.210
<v Speaker 3>this block and we say you were a part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our group or block or community and uh,</v>

379
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.823
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we say that you didn't have the same </v>

380
00:20:02.311 --> 00:20:03.260
<v Speaker 3>bright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

381
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a white Anglo Saxon woman at Yale.</v>

382
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.770
<v Speaker 3>We say the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bill of rights doesn't apply to you.</v>

383
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:10.723
<v Speaker 3>It's against your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that hasn't been thought through at </v>

384
00:20:13.401 --> 00:20:13.760
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

385
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we split people into,</v>

386
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.433
<v Speaker 2>into these little boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then what we ended up carrying the </v>

387
00:20:18.261 --> 00:20:22.760
<v Speaker 2>least about is the people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the smaller boxes within those boxes.</v>

388
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as monitoring the wall set,</v>

389
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.560
<v Speaker 3>so you mentioned doing it view has this </v>
<v Speaker 3>little phrase,</v>

390
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.350
<v Speaker 3>what about minorities?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We remind ourselves,</v>

391
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about what about liberals and this </v>

392
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.070
<v Speaker 3>is thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blast females,</v>

393
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.540
<v Speaker 3>the women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gay.</v>

394
00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:39.220
<v Speaker 3>So people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell,</v>

395
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.370
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am not this group.</v>

396
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a Muslim or a Jew or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm American.</v>

397
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me is the</v>

398
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.383
<v Speaker 3>ultimate irony here is that the spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that I've brought on the show </v>

399
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 3>in that now I've connected with on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter or wherever it is,</v>

400
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.953
<v Speaker 3>is I'm not judging any of these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on their color or their religion </v>

401
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:03.010
<v Speaker 3>or their ethnicity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm basing it on their ideas,</v>

402
00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the most liberal idea.</v>

403
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:06.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

404
00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.700
<v Speaker 3>you're actually treating them as </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals because they're very,</v>

405
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:10.960
<v Speaker 3>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

406
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:16.290
<v Speaker 3>a golf help you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only problem of identity politics is</v>

407
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.910
<v Speaker 3>when you stop preaching to people as </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals.</v>

408
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.720
<v Speaker 3>You kind of identity politics is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

409
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:24.411
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

410
00:21:24.411 --> 00:21:25.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

411
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:26.763
<v Speaker 3>is a slippery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>treacherous conjunction is you can only </v>

412
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:32.440
<v Speaker 3>have like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you can have politics.</v>

413
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Politics means you don't just look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and say,</v>

414
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 3>there's a block in this instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're talking about,</v>

415
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.053
<v Speaker 3>the Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean there's a group called </v>

416
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.413
<v Speaker 3>the Muslims because when do you say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you normally end up handing over the </v>

417
00:21:47.771 --> 00:21:48.604
<v Speaker 3>right to speak to these Muslims who have</v>
<v Speaker 3>asked your permission to the most </v>

418
00:21:52.701 --> 00:21:54.000
<v Speaker 3>reactionary people in it.</v>

419
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:58.000
<v Speaker 3>The people who who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wants to enforce a communal identity</v>

420
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.580
<v Speaker 3>and want to enforce it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

421
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.653
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there's all this paranoia going </v>

422
00:22:03.011 --> 00:22:06.460
<v Speaker 3>round after the Paris attacks and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>awful events in California,</v>

423
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.473
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first and foremost want to enforce on </v>

424
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Barrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unkind on their tribe in fourth or fifth</v>

425
00:22:13.831 --> 00:22:18.420
<v Speaker 3>of booze on them to keep them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the worst part of it is,</v>

426
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.370
<v Speaker 3>I think we've been particularly bad in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain and America because we have this</v>

427
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Speaker 3>identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Multicultural problem you've had is,</v>

428
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.140
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

429
00:22:28.141 --> 00:22:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm about the men and the women who say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the second.</v>

430
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:31.264
<v Speaker 3>This guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the community leader doesn't represent </v>

431
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.023
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never voted for him and agree with </v>

432
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:36.514
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about this man who says he's a </v>

433
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:40.210
<v Speaker 3>priest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rabbi and Lula,</v>

434
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.673
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe in all this crap or I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>be partially believe in it or I believe </v>

435
00:22:44.891 --> 00:22:47.170
<v Speaker 3>in bits to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

436
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.350
<v Speaker 3>you then stopped treating me as if this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and this meeting is,</v>

437
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.120
<v Speaker 3>this group owns me without my permission</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's his.</v>

438
00:22:55.150 --> 00:23:00.150
<v Speaker 3>That's his huge weakness today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's well an awful lot.</v>

439
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Before we go onto great question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so with the sound,</v>

440
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.230
<v Speaker 3>with your right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Syria,</v>

441
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.303
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do about Islamic </v>

442
00:23:07.361 --> 00:23:10.470
<v Speaker 3>state is where everyday cruelty happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>in also song.</v>

443
00:23:10.471 --> 00:23:11.304
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's where men and women who need a </v>

444
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.520
<v Speaker 3>confident liberalism and liberalism </v>
<v Speaker 3>beliefs in human rights,</v>

445
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.393
<v Speaker 3>liberalism that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually we're not going to say </v>

446
00:23:23.711 --> 00:23:24.544
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What matters first and foremost about </v>

447
00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.004
<v Speaker 3>you is your color or creed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need them to help them and they </v>

448
00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:30.724
<v Speaker 3>turned around to the very people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be able to help them and they're </v>

449
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 3>not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

450
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:34.804
<v Speaker 3>they're on the other side.</v>

451
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.180
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on the other side.</v>

452
00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:37.014
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the key piece because it's not </v>

453
00:23:38.071 --> 00:23:38.904
<v Speaker 2>just that it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're actually working to stop the </v>

454
00:23:41.161 --> 00:23:44.460
<v Speaker 2>reformers and by calling everyone racist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of this stuff,</v>

455
00:23:44.461 --> 00:23:45.294
<v Speaker 2>and then you know what we have going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>very much so in America right now is </v>

456
00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:49.544
<v Speaker 2>that Donald trump just this week says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to close the borders to all </v>

457
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:53.481
<v Speaker 2>Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

458
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 2>now he throws red meat to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets.</v>

459
00:23:56.571 --> 00:24:01.100
<v Speaker 2>He probably does more good work for isis</v>
<v Speaker 2>recruiting that he could possibly do,</v>

460
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.850
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately he's been strengthened</v>
<v Speaker 2>by by a week left.</v>

461
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:09.050
<v Speaker 2>You talk a lot about that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how they the this far left group.</v>

462
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Now what we're calling the regressives </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately end up strengthening a lot of</v>

463
00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:13.820
<v Speaker 2>ideas that they should be against.</v>

464
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:15.203
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're seeing with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was amazing today in which is where I </v>

465
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:25.840
<v Speaker 3>work and I loved the place and here's </v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain's leading left,</v>

466
00:24:25.841 --> 00:24:30.140
<v Speaker 3>the newspaper and people in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions about Donald Trump.</v>

467
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.353
<v Speaker 3>That first questions were know and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could see perhaps I'm reading too much </v>

468
00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:42.011
<v Speaker 3>into the audience members and such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Donald Trump was stopping her.</v>

469
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.940
<v Speaker 3>She taking on reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in,</v>

470
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all on years,</v>

471
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.440
<v Speaker 3>on years besides so you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've gone.</v>

472
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

473
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.030
<v Speaker 3>to get the notion that there are two </v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme rights,</v>

474
00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:00.683
<v Speaker 3>there is the extreme right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wouldn't until a few weeks ago </v>

475
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:05.294
<v Speaker 3>said Donald Trump was on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to be heading that way now and </v>

476
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 3>there is the religious extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

477
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.343
<v Speaker 3>extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

478
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:14.423
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you need to find them both for the </v>

479
00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:20.990
<v Speaker 3>same reasons and with the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments.</v>

480
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.080
<v Speaker 3>She's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People seem to find that very,</v>

481
00:25:24.081 --> 00:25:24.914
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strikes me as the only principal </v>

482
00:25:26.271 --> 00:25:27.104
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I imagined if I walked onto any </v>

483
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.220
<v Speaker 3>campus in America and said that there'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>be no platform,</v>

484
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.440
<v Speaker 2>not only would there be no platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'd be trigger warning.</v>

485
00:25:34.441 --> 00:25:35.274
<v Speaker 2>Do they go into a safe space?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the other stuff we're talking about </v>

486
00:25:37.391 --> 00:25:38.224
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

487
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.560
<v Speaker 3>was so frightening.</v>

488
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.753
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had several guests that I didn't </v>

489
00:25:42.571 --> 00:25:43.404
<v Speaker 2>think were that frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that for some reason have to have </v>

490
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:49.050
<v Speaker 2>trigger warnings issued before they </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak on campuses.</v>

491
00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.093
<v Speaker 2>So a look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this is happening in Europe </v>

492
00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:54.570
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another reason that I'm talking</v>

493
00:25:54.571 --> 00:25:55.404
<v Speaker 2>about it so much because I don't want it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take hold here the way it has taken </v>

494
00:25:58.681 --> 00:25:59.514
<v Speaker 2>hold in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of the far right </v>

495
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:03.210
<v Speaker 2>parties that are now winning across </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe?</v>

496
00:26:03.211 --> 00:26:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marine Le Pen.</v>

497
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Just one in France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in.</v>

498
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.550
<v Speaker 2>I now see that in Denmark and in Sweden </v>
<v Speaker 2>far right.</v>

499
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Parties are leading in polls for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time ever.</v>

500
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

501
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.380
<v Speaker 2>so this thing seems to be miss </v>
<v Speaker 2>metastasizing,</v>

502
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:17.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in front of our eyes.</v>

503
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are reasons for that day.</v>

504
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:25.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like USA.</v>

505
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.680
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to beeline the USA without</v>
<v Speaker 3>the common culture,</v>

506
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:34.910
<v Speaker 3>common institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as I'm fond of pointing out to a,</v>

507
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a in new world to be like the US.</v>

508
00:26:37.511 --> 00:26:38.310
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

509
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:42.180
<v Speaker 3>USA had one hell of a civil war before </v>
<v Speaker 3>it became the USA Today.</v>

510
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want,</v>

511
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 3>do you want that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are other reasons.</v>

512
00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.940
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two things I want to say.</v>

513
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:51.720
<v Speaker 3>One you might quite like the other than </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you might quite like is,</v>

514
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.900
<v Speaker 3>is we seem to agree on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says you can't run around the streets</v>

515
00:26:56.901 --> 00:26:59.640
<v Speaker 3>in your head off A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

516
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.503
<v Speaker 3>Having trigger warnings and safe spaces </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I'd know a celebrity or a </v>

517
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:04.344
<v Speaker 3>politician makes a slightly off color </v>
<v Speaker 3>remark about homosexuals or women who's </v>

518
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:09.973
<v Speaker 3>like sexist remark about women and </v>
<v Speaker 3>having reading the news and a couple of </v>

519
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.340
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

520
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needing,</v>

521
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 3>needing a culture to calm themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>down afterwards and then,</v>

522
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:26.690
<v Speaker 3>and then ignore religious homophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including beverly religious,</v>

523
00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:31.110
<v Speaker 3>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>February among ethnic minorities.</v>

524
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.143
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that without paying a price</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think people aren't watching </v>

525
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:38.200
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

526
00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:42.540
<v Speaker 3>don't think the rest of society had lots</v>
<v Speaker 3>of political writing on the left as well</v>

527
00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:44.790
<v Speaker 3>as the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a private club,</v>

528
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's talk to themselves,</v>

529
00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:49.020
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right watches,</v>

530
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of less walk.</v>

531
00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.020
<v Speaker 3>She's Gong Stewart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

532
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 3>they just talk themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a private club and everyone</v>

533
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:57.160
<v Speaker 3>understands the rules and they forget </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sound side.</v>

534
00:27:57.161 --> 00:27:59.280
<v Speaker 3>It's a watchman and get outside and are </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

535
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.980
<v Speaker 3>you bloody hypocrites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

536
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.880
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>

537
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:03.803
<v Speaker 3>you will have one rule for white people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and another rule for the rest and you </v>

538
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.780
<v Speaker 3>will not stand up to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as principal,</v>

539
00:28:10.781 --> 00:28:12.840
<v Speaker 3>so there is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that does matter.</v>

540
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.200
<v Speaker 3>A political correctness in Britain has </v>
<v Speaker 3>become,</v>

541
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.543
<v Speaker 3>has become this kind of swear words and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean stuff that you would </v>

542
00:28:20.761 --> 00:28:21.300
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

543
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.940
<v Speaker 3>My political rights means deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep,</v>

544
00:28:23.941 --> 00:28:26.760
<v Speaker 3>deep hypocrisy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ms Dot government too.</v>

545
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Speaker 3>Government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's all true.</v>

546
00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:29.154
<v Speaker 3>You can blame the left only on hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know people about how bad am I </v>

547
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:37.170
<v Speaker 3>allowed to swear on your progress?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where away bring it people who voted for</v>

548
00:28:37.171 --> 00:28:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to come a point where you just</v>

549
00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:39.361
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

550
00:28:39.361 --> 00:28:42.330
<v Speaker 3>fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're voting for Donald Trump,</v>

551
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.730
<v Speaker 3>you have a greater pet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We moved Sean.</v>

552
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.713
<v Speaker 3>We will not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will not give up on you with your </v>

553
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:51.220
<v Speaker 3>fellow citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there comes a point where you said,</v>

554
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.063
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hell with you,</v>

555
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are peddling.</v>

556
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.270
<v Speaker 3>The difficulty is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and is.</v>

557
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.750
<v Speaker 3>It does come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

558
00:28:57.751 --> 00:29:02.751
<v Speaker 3>If you're very confused about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've now go the worst type of,</v>

559
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of leftist leading or opposition parties</v>

560
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.300
<v Speaker 3>later who's like a caricature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I had to write an example of,</v>

561
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.450
<v Speaker 3>of the worst of the leftists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain,</v>

562
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Corbyn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy,</v>

563
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.620
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

564
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.120
<v Speaker 3>The only good thing about them becoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>a believer,</v>

565
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:23.830
<v Speaker 3>his books I wrote are now selling like </v>
<v Speaker 3>hotcakes,</v>

566
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 3>but I mean by selfish point of view of </v>
<v Speaker 3>science is,</v>

567
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.003
<v Speaker 3>is you've got a terrible rights in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America with trump in France who's </v>

568
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:39.710
<v Speaker 3>national front in Sweden and Denmark and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these places a pendulum and,</v>

569
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.113
<v Speaker 3>and he's popping all over your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no interest because immigration </v>

570
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 3>integration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul,</v>

571
00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:45.503
<v Speaker 3>because the European,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a single currency as being one of the </v>

572
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.070
<v Speaker 3>greatest economic mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

573
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:56.540
<v Speaker 3>and then you go left in a space where a </v>
<v Speaker 3>principal should be certainly embracing.</v>

574
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 3>You've got this kind of geographical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good girl.</v>

575
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:00.334
<v Speaker 3>I'm with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

576
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any organization,</v>

577
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:06.010
<v Speaker 3>how as a fascistic uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as it sound.</v>

578
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.113
<v Speaker 3>So you didn't who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of people who are feeling a bit </v>

579
00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:10.360
<v Speaker 3>political politically homeless over </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

580
00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it all feel like a perfect storm to</v>

581
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:14.290
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on right now,</v>

582
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 2>and again this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the stuff that's after your book</v>

583
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:17.074
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about the refugees and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the economic problems in Europe and </v>

584
00:30:21.311 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

585
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:22.863
<v Speaker 2>dealing with radical Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was going on while you were writing </v>

586
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:25.810
<v Speaker 2>the book obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems,</v>

587
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.793
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me we have like five things </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now that are all working at the </v>

588
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:32.230
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you toss in social media,</v>

589
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.243
<v Speaker 2>you toss in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see videos from everywhere now we </v>

590
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:37.260
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see beheadings,</v>

591
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.060
<v Speaker 2>we can see bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:39.933
<v Speaker 2>so you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see religious violence and you </v>

593
00:30:41.261 --> 00:30:42.094
<v Speaker 2>can see state violence all the time that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really have all of this happening at </v>

594
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:47.860
<v Speaker 2>once and it's leading to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a very strange place.</v>

595
00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.193
<v Speaker 3>I think one thing Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can say with certainty that whoever </v>

596
00:30:53.611 --> 00:30:58.611
<v Speaker 3>it was a full of Berlin Wall was the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of history history.</v>

597
00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 3>If over boy was that a stupid thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say and you can't,</v>

598
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:08.640
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me get back to the point I made.</v>

599
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.513
<v Speaker 3>She was stopped at the weirdness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypocrisy and the awful betrayal of </v>

600
00:31:14.701 --> 00:31:15.534
<v Speaker 3>people you get on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who call themselves the left </v>

601
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.910
<v Speaker 3>comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

602
00:31:20.911 --> 00:31:25.911
<v Speaker 3>don't have a socialist alternative you </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to have in the Soviet Union falls.</v>

603
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Socialism collapses across the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one believes that anymore.</v>

604
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.580
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was fine for awhile.</v>

605
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:37.280
<v Speaker 3>If I may generalize it a very Glib way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

606
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.600
<v Speaker 3>that was fine for awhile because </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalist,</v>

607
00:31:39.601 --> 00:31:42.240
<v Speaker 3>and we'll call it what you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to be a great success story,</v>

608
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:43.703
<v Speaker 3>seemed to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I it for Carolina was not an </v>

609
00:31:46.051 --> 00:31:48.490
<v Speaker 3>idiot when he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

610
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.343
<v Speaker 3>ever since the crash of 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that system of liberal capitalism has </v>

611
00:31:54.271 --> 00:31:54.660
<v Speaker 3>failed.</v>

612
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.020
<v Speaker 3>And that's why you've got this feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>of perfect storm.</v>

613
00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Too many things coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

614
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:00.503
<v Speaker 3>what is it is not entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a wonderful phrase by the </v>

615
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Italian socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Antonio Gramsci,</v>

616
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:09.303
<v Speaker 3>you own despair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new cannot be born in that </v>

617
00:32:11.251 --> 00:32:12.690
<v Speaker 3>interregnum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many strange,</v>

618
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.613
<v Speaker 3>strange forms will appear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that we don't know what </v>

619
00:32:16.561 --> 00:32:19.020
<v Speaker 3>comes next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not sure of what we've got.</v>

620
00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:20.970
<v Speaker 3>We're not sure it works anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure it works,</v>

621
00:32:20.971 --> 00:32:23.070
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or Ms Dot middle class America.</v>

622
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.113
<v Speaker 3>Americans watching your program have </v>
<v Speaker 3>their payers and going after the super </v>

623
00:32:28.141 --> 00:32:31.380
<v Speaker 3>rich are getting richer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The American dream doesn't seem to quite</v>

624
00:32:31.381 --> 00:32:33.720
<v Speaker 3>work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with it with a bomber.</v>

625
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not quite clear where.</v>

626
00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:40.410
<v Speaker 3>Where are the old challenges for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aren't you get these strange boredom's a</v>

627
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.420
<v Speaker 3>free case forms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is when I wrote about cork.</v>

628
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:45.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I said,</v>

629
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 3>people just kept saying for your neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neck,</v>

630
00:32:46.971 --> 00:32:49.230
<v Speaker 3>neck that suggest they suggest on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendlies.</v>

631
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Well now it's on the main screen.</v>

632
00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:51.683
<v Speaker 2>Going to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about some of the tactics these </v>

633
00:32:54.151 --> 00:32:56.700
<v Speaker 2>guys use and I want to talk a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Chomsky,</v>

634
00:32:56.701 --> 00:32:59.250
<v Speaker 2>but first we can talk just sort of in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more broader sense.</v>

635
00:32:59.251 --> 00:33:00.084
<v Speaker 2>When I've seen the way these guys debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the way they treat topics and you </v>

636
00:33:03.331 --> 00:33:03.721
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

637
00:33:03.721 --> 00:33:04.554
<v Speaker 2>everyone is racist and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't seem to mind if they get </v>

638
00:33:07.231 --> 00:33:08.400
<v Speaker 2>caught in lies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

639
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:09.263
<v Speaker 2>They love just throwing out the bomb and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we let it spreads like wildfire on </v>

640
00:33:13.351 --> 00:33:15.810
<v Speaker 2>social media and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that famous saying,</v>

641
00:33:15.811 --> 00:33:17.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes one second to lie,</v>

642
00:33:17.671 --> 00:33:20.220
<v Speaker 2>but it takes a lifetime to get it back </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

643
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.280
<v Speaker 2>And it seems that a series of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

644
00:33:23.281 --> 00:33:25.640
<v Speaker 2>they love this and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look again,</v>

645
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on the right so I can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the right.</v>

646
00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I've never been part of the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I police them differently,</v>

647
00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:33.000
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to see this from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

648
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.680
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think about just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tactics that they're using?</v>

649
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.220
<v Speaker 3>One question to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a plain speaking,</v>

650
00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:43.370
<v Speaker 3>open heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't behave.</v>

651
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Any bathroom that people</v>

652
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.930
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't look,</v>

653
00:33:46.931 --> 00:33:47.231
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

654
00:33:47.231 --> 00:33:48.064
<v Speaker 2>I'm dealing in America with trump right </v>
<v Speaker 2>this second with over the top bombast </v>

655
00:33:50.771 --> 00:33:51.450
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

656
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:52.283
<v Speaker 2>and again this is why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look I'm a guilty liberal in that sense </v>

657
00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:54.934
<v Speaker 2>that sometimes I feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent so much time on the guys on my </v>

658
00:33:58.151 --> 00:33:59.710
<v Speaker 2>side and then I'm afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

659
00:33:59.711 --> 00:34:00.544
<v Speaker 2>people ask me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I afraid that ultimately this will </v>

660
00:34:02.981 --> 00:34:05.500
<v Speaker 2>strengthen the right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

661
00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.050
<v Speaker 2>but to me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we don't stand up now,</v>

662
00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.140
<v Speaker 2>well then the game is over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just hand it to the right,</v>

663
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:12.910
<v Speaker 2>which is what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with trump.</v>

664
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:15.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

665
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a long tradition of,</v>

666
00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.190
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of lying on the left,</v>

667
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go back to,</v>

668
00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:24.730
<v Speaker 3>to Stalin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

669
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.733
<v Speaker 3>he golfs gullible people to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>show trials where people confess the </v>

670
00:34:31.001 --> 00:34:32.980
<v Speaker 3>croc impossible crimes that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>committed.</v>

671
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.700
<v Speaker 3>So there is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm less,</v>

672
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm less interested unless concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>about left and right.</v>

673
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Then this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here is something that happens when with</v>

674
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.760
<v Speaker 3>new media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

675
00:34:48.761 --> 00:34:51.380
<v Speaker 3>have stapes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

676
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.830
<v Speaker 3>here for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is a pretty bad thing.</v>

677
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.863
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think his main audience seems to be </v>

678
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.883
<v Speaker 3>little girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this could be reusing material to </v>

679
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.420
<v Speaker 3>write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

680
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

681
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a bad day.</v>

682
00:35:02.291 --> 00:35:03.880
<v Speaker 3>You've got nothing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got no ideas.</v>

683
00:35:03.881 --> 00:35:06.470
<v Speaker 3>I know I'll turn on Fox News is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is we're pretty lucky.</v>

684
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.533
<v Speaker 3>You've now got states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia and Iran most notionally </v>

685
00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:17.370
<v Speaker 3>producing propagate the gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So beggar cater to pushing whole truth,</v>

686
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.010
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lies,</v>

687
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets shot down over Ukraine.</v>

688
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:28.930
<v Speaker 3>There's television channels in English </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are pumping stuff out.</v>

689
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:33.280
<v Speaker 3>So you were around as wants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're on the left in America,</v>

690
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 3>you just have to go on and on about </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

691
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:38.214
<v Speaker 3>Nixon was posting downs or something in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Wall Street Journal reading </v>

692
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.830
<v Speaker 3>something on Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're only in America,</v>

693
00:35:43.831 --> 00:35:45.900
<v Speaker 3>you were complaining about New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>Times,</v>

694
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deliberately covering something up.</v>

695
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Now you suddenly go whole states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

696
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:52.913
<v Speaker 3>with their secret services at foreign </v>
<v Speaker 3>offices that propaganda arms behind him </v>

697
00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.283
<v Speaker 3>pumping material include west,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is instantly taken up by both the </v>

698
00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:03.594
<v Speaker 3>far left on the roads case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult certainly in </v>

699
00:36:07.441 --> 00:36:08.370
<v Speaker 3>Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as I say,</v>

700
00:36:08.371 --> 00:36:11.880
<v Speaker 3>things have gotten much much earlier </v>
<v Speaker 3>than they have in America is very,</v>

701
00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:15.230
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to tell her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

702
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

703
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 3>the people who support boosting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

704
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:23.490
<v Speaker 3>in Russia today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got marine Le Pen doing it.</v>

705
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Who is the lead for French far right </v>
<v Speaker 3>party.</v>

706
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:26.783
<v Speaker 3>You Got Galloway gallaway who's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>screening as combination of left </v>

707
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:30.640
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Mr Griffin,</v>

708
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:31.783
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you've got a kind of merger of </v>

709
00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:36.294
<v Speaker 3>the extremes against liberal democracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're both equally Kim Kardashian </v>

710
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:44.930
<v Speaker 3>that both equally sinful nature raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What matters to the most is,</v>

711
00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.560
<v Speaker 3>is building conspiratorial narrative.</v>

712
00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.493
<v Speaker 2>So in a lot of ways we really could </v>
<v Speaker 2>blame sort of mainstream media for this </v>

713
00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:54.550
<v Speaker 2>craziness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

714
00:36:54.551 --> 00:36:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems to me that for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

715
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.633
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which had no competition before the </v>

716
00:36:59.231 --> 00:37:00.064
<v Speaker 2>digital age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did such a poor job that then they </v>

717
00:37:03.071 --> 00:37:03.904
<v Speaker 2>handed everything over to the digital </v>
<v Speaker 2>side and I think for awhile the online </v>

718
00:37:06.761 --> 00:37:11.440
<v Speaker 2>media for the first few years of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they did do a really nice job in</v>

719
00:37:11.441 --> 00:37:15.670
<v Speaker 2>breaking stories and getting out </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that you wouldn't,</v>

720
00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.580
<v Speaker 2>that you wouldn't get otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now it seems like the gloves are off</v>

721
00:37:18.581 --> 00:37:19.660
<v Speaker 2>and now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything's true.</v>

722
00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows who to trust.</v>

723
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

724
00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:22.893
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of truth now except </v>

725
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.330
<v Speaker 3>some kind of binary division between new</v>
<v Speaker 3>major in Obj.</v>

726
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.710
<v Speaker 3>It's good journalists and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

727
00:37:31.711 --> 00:37:32.544
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are me to go and observe a or a </v>

728
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:39.360
<v Speaker 3>on the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>

729
00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:40.203
<v Speaker 3>you're talking reports on the La Times a</v>
<v Speaker 3>and something that you've done a </v>

730
00:37:43.381 --> 00:37:46.050
<v Speaker 3>terrible job of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're allowing all these,</v>

731
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.890
<v Speaker 3>a crank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These fruitcakes sees a Flim,</v>

732
00:37:49.891 --> 00:37:53.580
<v Speaker 3>flam merchants from all over the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>or to walk all over you.</v>

733
00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.550
<v Speaker 3>The man or woman the La Times was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked like,</v>

734
00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>business models collapsed.</v>

735
00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:00.573
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to staff your rows and in </v>

736
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Peking and Beijing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me a break.</v>

737
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can.</v>

738
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.640
<v Speaker 3>We can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can barely get a report or you know,</v>

739
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.890
<v Speaker 3>up the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco,</v>

740
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.680
<v Speaker 3>the business model for if you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious,</v>

741
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.700
<v Speaker 3>a serious farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as good as it is,</v>

742
00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:22.470
<v Speaker 3>getting harder and harder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainable.</v>

743
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:23.923
<v Speaker 3>Surely La Times and newspapers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>across America are to my knowledge from </v>

744
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:32.430
<v Speaker 3>having met him and we work on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll to try and keep it going.</v>

745
00:38:32.431 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 3>But Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lack of money talks,</v>

746
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.093
<v Speaker 3>money talks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the silence that comes from the </v>

747
00:38:38.181 --> 00:38:40.410
<v Speaker 3>lack of money is a silence between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

748
00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.470
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This debate,</v>

749
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.453
<v Speaker 3>so the gap is being filled and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>worries me is it's not people talking </v>

750
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:48.214
<v Speaker 3>rubbish or people talking drivel is they</v>
<v Speaker 3>always have is where are you going to </v>

751
00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:58.430
<v Speaker 3>get the reliable report?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is happening in Peking,</v>

752
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.033
<v Speaker 3>Beijing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are you going to get the reliable </v>

753
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.253
<v Speaker 3>pull reports on how coaching is </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulating a European opinion that's </v>

754
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:09.490
<v Speaker 3>getting harder and harder to.</v>

755
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:10.141
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

756
00:39:10.141 --> 00:39:10.974
<v Speaker 2>as it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as someone that I consider an expert in </v>

757
00:39:12.181 --> 00:39:14.190
<v Speaker 2>this space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you decide who to trust?</v>

758
00:39:14.191 --> 00:39:15.630
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know anymore.</v>

759
00:39:15.631 --> 00:39:16.464
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

760
00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:18.330
<v Speaker 2>I follow a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations,</v>

761
00:39:18.331 --> 00:39:19.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Left middle,</v>

762
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:20.623
<v Speaker 2>know as reputable and some off the deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>end and I try to pilfer out some </v>

763
00:39:24.031 --> 00:39:24.864
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and some truth and I try not </v>
<v Speaker 2>to only follow things that reinforce my </v>

764
00:39:29.011 --> 00:39:29.844
<v Speaker 2>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another huge problem with </v>

765
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:34.170
<v Speaker 2>social media has given us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how do you decide who to trust?</v>

766
00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:35.683
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably got accused me of being </v>

767
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:38.613
<v Speaker 3>horribly old fashioned stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean there are student </v>

768
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.740
<v Speaker 3>organizations I trust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still trusted off trying to newspapers</v>

770
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.160
<v Speaker 3>and Alexis because I know there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

771
00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:48.994
<v Speaker 3>very strong editing process there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's opinion pages are sap for us and </v>

772
00:39:52.421 --> 00:39:53.254
<v Speaker 3>what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that may changes as the business </v>

773
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 3>model for journalism goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still don't.</v>

774
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

775
00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 2>they had an op Ed on the front page for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time in [inaudible] 95 years.</v>

776
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.180
<v Speaker 3>Just disgraceful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disgraceful.</v>

777
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go around the wheels,</v>

778
00:40:04.741 --> 00:40:08.520
<v Speaker 3>go round and have a dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't want your bloody opinions.</v>

779
00:40:08.521 --> 00:40:10.170
<v Speaker 3>We also say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give us some news.</v>

780
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.030
<v Speaker 2>I've read a paper that had that on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the front of.</v>

781
00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:13.541
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let,</v>

782
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:14.374
<v Speaker 2>let's back up for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk for a few minutes about Noam </v>

783
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Chomsky because you talk about him a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the book.</v>

784
00:40:18.611 --> 00:40:21.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not a tremendous amount but you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I have a friend,</v>

785
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.193
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is on what I consider it in this </v>

786
00:40:24.131 --> 00:40:24.964
<v Speaker 2>regressive group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of times we'll be debating </v>

787
00:40:26.981 --> 00:40:28.910
<v Speaker 2>back and forth about this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

788
00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:29.763
<v Speaker 2>I'll be giving him as much historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge as I have and as much factual </v>

789
00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:33.994
<v Speaker 2>knowledge as I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he'll sort of always end </v>

790
00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:37.210
<v Speaker 2>everything by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

791
00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.373
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I read some Chomsky and I'm just </v>

792
00:40:40.391 --> 00:40:43.510
<v Speaker 2>kind of giving back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you sort of hit on that also</v>

793
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:44.344
<v Speaker 2>in the book that there's just this </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief in this guy that maybe isn't </v>

794
00:40:48.521 --> 00:40:49.354
<v Speaker 2>fully warranted or he's been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been very good at waving off the </v>

795
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:54.400
<v Speaker 2>things that don't quite agree with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview.</v>

796
00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.900
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

797
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.950
<v Speaker 3>he was an old guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

798
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:04.483
<v Speaker 3>shout them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean he's adopted some pretty </v>

799
00:41:07.111 --> 00:41:12.111
<v Speaker 3>disgraceful positions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a massive Bosnian Muslims.</v>

800
00:41:13.591 --> 00:41:14.424
<v Speaker 3>And so going along with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>1990 and going along and never missing </v>

801
00:41:20.121 --> 00:41:23.130
<v Speaker 3>is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And building this very.</v>

802
00:41:23.131 --> 00:41:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Trump's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his writing is very poor writing,</v>

803
00:41:25.711 --> 00:41:26.544
<v Speaker 3>so stands for English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it builds is very dense web of </v>

804
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:30.810
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your friend wants your in your like,</v>

805
00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:32.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fly in the.</v>

806
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's very to go out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's.</v>

807
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.470
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of a a fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say in America,</v>

808
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:44.620
<v Speaker 3>you finished this man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

809
00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 3>This is all from a point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sort of made up and actually when you</v>

810
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:51.110
<v Speaker 3>figured out what he's doing is quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>disgraceful,</v>

811
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.860
<v Speaker 3>but here's why Chomsky was worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversion.</v>

812
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:55.783
<v Speaker 3>Chapter two is it is what kinds of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are young on an American campus and </v>

813
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:03.104
<v Speaker 3>you get your.</v>

814
00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.450
<v Speaker 3>Can you read all his books and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

815
00:42:05.451 --> 00:42:10.070
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of society are you aiming for?</v>

816
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.053
<v Speaker 3>There is no social vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that the grasses and </v>

817
00:42:14.271 --> 00:42:15.104
<v Speaker 3>socialists to run through American </v>
<v Speaker 3>history from the 18 eighties were </v>

818
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:18.940
<v Speaker 3>recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just say,</v>

819
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.470
<v Speaker 3>this is all just saying Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit me,</v>

820
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.220
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

821
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.370
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We probably would never have happened.</v>

822
00:42:25.371 --> 00:42:26.204
<v Speaker 3>The pilgrim files,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we probably have churned down at </v>

823
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:30.710
<v Speaker 3>Plymouth Rock and gone back to England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is a disaster.</v>

824
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Everything it does is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is alive and you think,</v>

825
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:36.260
<v Speaker 3>well actually ridiculous World Vision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funnily enough.</v>

826
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really easy to buy into because you</v>

827
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:44.930
<v Speaker 3>didn't have to commit to anything if the</v>
<v Speaker 3>regressive left.</v>

828
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:46.250
<v Speaker 3>And so I really liked that phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

829
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:50.840
<v Speaker 3>let's take the regressive left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skin left the post socialist left.</v>

830
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:55.970
<v Speaker 3>On the one hand it has very little to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say positive and that's,</v>

831
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:59.090
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of easy for everyone to sign</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to.</v>

832
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 3>You just have to think that Washington </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a pile of shit.</v>

833
00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.000
<v Speaker 3>But I mean Washington DC is a pile of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

834
00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Well that's sure as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the State Department doesn't have,</v>

835
00:43:08.341 --> 00:43:11.630
<v Speaker 3>is doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The CIO is wicked.</v>

836
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:12.703
<v Speaker 3>And so instead of having a left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to make really positive </v>

837
00:43:17.901 --> 00:43:19.430
<v Speaker 3>commitments for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

838
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.690
<v Speaker 3>40 years ago I couldn't have come on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your program and said,</v>

839
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm a socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

840
00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm a socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

841
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.500
<v Speaker 3>And you're already said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh nick,</v>

842
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:27.663
<v Speaker 3>he's associate if that sounds good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll go along and I say I wasn't </v>

843
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.350
<v Speaker 3>massively high taxes or I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nationalize this and that.</v>

844
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.980
<v Speaker 3>And people who would it be an agreement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We said we'll back off and say,</v>

845
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:38.390
<v Speaker 3>hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anything to do with this.</v>

846
00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is threatening my Livingston.</v>

847
00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.000
<v Speaker 3>Now you just have to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

848
00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:48.170
<v Speaker 3>everything you read is ally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

849
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:51.540
<v Speaker 3>your government's evil unless been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>

850
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:52.423
<v Speaker 3>that's actually because the flaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so few positive policy commitments as </v>

851
00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.740
<v Speaker 3>Chomsky does.</v>

852
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.660
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly very easy to go along </v>
<v Speaker 3>with him.</v>

853
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.583
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get into the hands of people here in </v>

854
00:44:02.301 --> 00:44:03.134
<v Speaker 3>London,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very expensive city for the </v>

855
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.320
<v Speaker 3>rich people I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that books find them Chomsky on the,</v>

856
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.550
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

857
00:44:10.551 --> 00:44:12.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on their shelves.</v>

858
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.870
<v Speaker 3>And that's big because funnily enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules,</v>

859
00:44:14.871 --> 00:44:19.871
<v Speaker 3>suppose radicalism that kind of left </v>
<v Speaker 3>without a positive program with just the</v>

860
00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:22.960
<v Speaker 3>critique is no threat to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no fretful wealthy.</v>

861
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.813
<v Speaker 3>He's known knowing fractally pamphlets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were friendly bankers on Wall </v>

862
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

863
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:27.973
<v Speaker 3>it's something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of people when they quite </v>

864
00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.480
<v Speaker 3>justifiably often pissed off at </v>
<v Speaker 3>government or because you know,</v>

865
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:37.050
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

866
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:40.590
<v Speaker 3>they've got a conspiracy theory mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>though because they will look friendly.</v>

867
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Everyone can sign up to that January </v>
<v Speaker 3>left wing program is hard.</v>

868
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.630
<v Speaker 3>The genuine left wing program make </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and enemies,</v>

869
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 3>but this kind of pseudo life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this regressive left.</v>

870
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.613
<v Speaker 3>It's terribly easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>easily even too easy I think for any </v>

871
00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:56.310
<v Speaker 3>successful political movement.</v>

872
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:57.283
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because I was really </v>

873
00:44:58.311 --> 00:44:59.144
<v Speaker 2>embedded in it for a couple of years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I hadn't pieced this all </v>

874
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:03.500
<v Speaker 2>together what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right now,</v>

875
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.340
<v Speaker 2>but part of my frustration was that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>never talked about solutions.</v>

876
00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:10.100
<v Speaker 2>We always could talk about problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

877
00:45:10.101 --> 00:45:11.480
<v Speaker 2>It was always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

878
00:45:11.481 --> 00:45:15.200
<v Speaker 2>the American industrial complex and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bombing and race and whatever,</v>

879
00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:18.460
<v Speaker 2>but there were never solution so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does get to what you're saying that</v>

880
00:45:18.461 --> 00:45:19.294
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

881
00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.173
<v Speaker 3>could as soon as you offer solution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to piss some people off </v>

882
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.520
<v Speaker 3>because it's an illusion meat and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not making a commitment.</v>

883
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.910
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as you make a commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little Dave Rubin believed this,</v>

884
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.980
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just wrong.</v>

885
00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:33.723
<v Speaker 3>It's very easy to just say it's all a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy it so that way you don't </v>

886
00:45:40.261 --> 00:45:42.030
<v Speaker 3>expose yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not making.</v>

887
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:42.893
<v Speaker 3>You're not making a poster program and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticking your neck out there where you </v>

888
00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.240
<v Speaker 3>sit down.</v>

889
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.273
<v Speaker 2>So speaking of conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the through lines throughout the </v>

890
00:45:50.651 --> 00:45:51.484
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you do devote a chapter to it </v>

891
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:56.800
<v Speaker 2>in completion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that in all of these movements,</v>

892
00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.813
<v Speaker 2>somehow blaming the Jews are always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It always comes around to blaming the </v>

893
00:46:01.991 --> 00:46:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the language has changed.</v>

894
00:46:03.731 --> 00:46:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Now it's blaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zionists</v>

895
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:07.950
<v Speaker 3>blamed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one says to us anymore</v>

896
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.251
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

897
00:46:09.251 --> 00:46:10.084
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not politically correct to say </v>

898
00:46:10.991 --> 00:46:11.824
<v Speaker 2>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just say Zionists are you say </v>

899
00:46:12.671 --> 00:46:13.504
<v Speaker 2>Israel or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really did lay out an </v>

900
00:46:15.191 --> 00:46:16.024
<v Speaker 2>interesting piece in almost every </v>
<v Speaker 2>example throughout time that they were </v>

901
00:46:19.571 --> 00:46:21.200
<v Speaker 2>always blame on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

902
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.840
<v Speaker 2>the capitalists would say the Jews are </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialists.</v>

903
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Socialists would say Jews are </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalists and every other which way.</v>

904
00:46:25.871 --> 00:46:26.704
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that is about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you probably just explained it </v>

905
00:46:28.631 --> 00:46:31.020
<v Speaker 2>with this conspiratorial thing and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

906
00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:31.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

907
00:46:31.811 --> 00:46:34.000
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>

908
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 3>If you genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will see I have a person for many,</v>

909
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.160
<v Speaker 3>many folks and I'm sure they'll lesion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you genuinely think that they,</v>

910
00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:52.390
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>secretly blew up the twin towers,</v>

911
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

912
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.413
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all kinds of types of play the </v>

913
00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:02.530
<v Speaker 3>adventures away if you go into a or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bomber is replies to the,</v>

914
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.660
<v Speaker 3>as much less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A borrower isn't to real American.</v>

915
00:47:05.661 --> 00:47:08.050
<v Speaker 3>He's a secret Muslim from Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

916
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:09.243
<v Speaker 3>if you can even believe that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in extraordinary view of the </v>

917
00:47:12.791 --> 00:47:17.791
<v Speaker 3>world where a handful of people can fool</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire population.</v>

918
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.760
<v Speaker 3>The sheep poop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

919
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:24.800
<v Speaker 3>while she's thinking about who are those</v>
<v Speaker 3>handful of people historically,</v>

920
00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you started down that road,</v>

921
00:47:28.571 --> 00:47:30.430
<v Speaker 3>you ended up the grades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

922
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.580
<v Speaker 3>how have you found shocking being called</v>
<v Speaker 3>caring?</v>

923
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.633
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think some of a liberal American </v>

924
00:47:39.461 --> 00:47:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Jews will find it shocking because I say</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're five years ahead of you.</v>

925
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes and hits her,</v>

926
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.173
<v Speaker 3>is this I how I never expected to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a few sentences perhaps I was being </v>

927
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:59.250
<v Speaker 3>like and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is quite extraordinary,</v>

928
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the extent of it.</v>

929
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's quite extraordinary how it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerated now,</v>

930
00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 3>isn't cooldowns now?</v>

931
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:08.083
<v Speaker 2>So do you think some of that when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I hear people say that the first </v>

932
00:48:09.921 --> 00:48:10.754
<v Speaker 2>real quick we should mention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just mentioned your last name </v>

933
00:48:11.871 --> 00:48:13.370
<v Speaker 2>calling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're actually not Jewish.</v>

934
00:48:13.371 --> 00:48:14.204
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

935
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

936
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:18.100
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

937
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:18.933
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my family abandoned her religion for </v>

938
00:48:20.071 --> 00:48:21.230
<v Speaker 3>Regina was system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

939
00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:22.064
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

940
00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:26.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ask Tommy and his family </v>
<v Speaker 3>have about 1900 views.</v>

941
00:48:26.481 --> 00:48:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't have to pay strict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Dave,</v>

942
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.520
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

943
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.740
<v Speaker 3>we'll be able to finger cute little said</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were curious.</v>

944
00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:38.240
<v Speaker 3>But here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at Anti Semitism,</v>

945
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:41.020
<v Speaker 3>antisemitism has virtually nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

946
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Antisemitism became in the late 19th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>

947
00:48:45.381 --> 00:48:47.640
<v Speaker 3>early 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Nazis,</v>

948
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:50.840
<v Speaker 3>it was some way of fighting progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a way of saying,</v>

949
00:48:50.841 --> 00:48:52.400
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you democracy,</v>

950
00:48:52.401 --> 00:48:54.230
<v Speaker 3>human rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women's rights,</v>

951
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.730
<v Speaker 3>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't believe in them.</v>

952
00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.640
<v Speaker 3>They were all praying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fraud,</v>

953
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:00.740
<v Speaker 3>say as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

954
00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:02.330
<v Speaker 3>they will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

955
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.793
<v Speaker 3>behind them is a pipe master,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling the strings in that public mass </v>

956
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:08.140
<v Speaker 3>with acute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

957
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.160
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would afford,</v>

958
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.073
<v Speaker 3>there's a left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but believes in democracy and human </v>

959
00:49:13.701 --> 00:49:16.490
<v Speaker 3>rights will be for its own sake because </v>
<v Speaker 3>maps,</v>

960
00:49:16.491 --> 00:49:21.491
<v Speaker 3>anything else only alert the whole time </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the dangers of.</v>

961
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 3>But actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

962
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.160
<v Speaker 3>going back to trump's aid believes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

963
00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.630
<v Speaker 3>They believe human rights is all full.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believe it's all live.</v>

964
00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:34.010
<v Speaker 3>So that's one reason why they ended up </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing or not Chomsky himself,</v>

965
00:49:34.011 --> 00:49:37.940
<v Speaker 3>but that's why people end up there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't understand what goes with it.</v>

966
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:42.970
<v Speaker 3>They didn't look at organizations like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hezbollah or Iran or and say,</v>

967
00:49:44.421 --> 00:49:45.590
<v Speaker 3>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

968
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:48.920
<v Speaker 3>they're antisemitic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just because of Israel.</v>

969
00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:49.830
<v Speaker 3>And then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

970
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.330
<v Speaker 3>homesick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look,</v>

971
00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:52.700
<v Speaker 3>the way they women look at where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>treat rules,</v>

972
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:55.890
<v Speaker 3>look at the way that they just miss </v>
<v Speaker 3>human rights were dismissed.</v>

973
00:49:55.930 --> 00:50:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Democracy in antisemitism absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes along with that.</v>

974
00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:05.050
<v Speaker 3>And once you accept antisemitism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to not just anti racist,</v>

975
00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.880
<v Speaker 3>but you have all your progressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>principles because historically,</v>

976
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:08.833
<v Speaker 3>antisemitism has always been used by </v>
<v Speaker 3>Oprah reactory movement who again left </v>

977
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.880
<v Speaker 3>should be against.</v>

978
00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:14.871
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

979
00:50:14.871 --> 00:50:15.704
<v Speaker 2>I always say when it comes to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just in Israel last week and </v>

980
00:50:17.961 --> 00:50:19.810
<v Speaker 2>at the top of the show when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I did my,</v>

981
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:20.903
<v Speaker 2>my piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying how I saw coexistence </v>

982
00:50:22.911 --> 00:50:24.350
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Jerusalem,</v>

983
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:26.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ate falafel in the Arab quarter,</v>

984
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 2>saw Israeli policemen helping Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>women move a box.</v>

985
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I saw ultra orthodox Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

986
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:36.410
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't happen anywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mideast except for Israel.</v>

987
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:37.244
<v Speaker 2>And of course not to say everything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect there and there's all sorts of </v>

988
00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:42.080
<v Speaker 2>political problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious problems and all that,</v>

989
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:43.123
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the only place that has any </v>

990
00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:46.820
<v Speaker 2>progressive values in the Middle East is</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel.</v>

991
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:47.833
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

992
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:52.603
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walked about quarter the boundary on </v>

993
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.470
<v Speaker 3>the wrong too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

994
00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:04.180
<v Speaker 3>you say someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

995
00:51:04.181 --> 00:51:06.280
<v Speaker 3>as problems on the West Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's problems in gauze.</v>

996
00:51:06.281 --> 00:51:08.930
<v Speaker 3>And you said what about Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because actually is quite a good wall.</v>

997
00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:14.060
<v Speaker 3>So that the council was about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think about it,</v>

998
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

999
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.510
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't say that doesn't mean that</v>
<v Speaker 3>students shouldn't have to run the state</v>

1000
00:51:18.511 --> 00:51:19.344
<v Speaker 3>and doesn't mean no horrendous problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the Israeli rocked and you </v>

1001
00:51:22.691 --> 00:51:27.691
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't sort of romanticize Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a asshole.</v>

1002
00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:29.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1003
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:33.700
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing is the problem.</v>

1004
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:38.910
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this is great reasons for,</v>

1005
00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.653
<v Speaker 3>I would say the liberal liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulty understanding radical Islam </v>

1006
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.353
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very good liberal impulse to </v>

1007
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.090
<v Speaker 3>assumes the world is rational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1008
00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:55.090
<v Speaker 3>there's the assumes that if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible.</v>

1009
00:51:55.091 --> 00:51:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Terroristic movement that were blow out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the twin towers,</v>

1010
00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:02.560
<v Speaker 3>the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we knew if they had chemical weapons</v>

1011
00:52:02.561 --> 00:52:05.110
<v Speaker 3>or nuclear weapons against feeling say </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

1012
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:08.760
<v Speaker 3>That must be a root cause for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1013
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:10.293
<v Speaker 3>that must be some rational explanation </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can satisfy that we can operate </v>

1014
00:52:15.521 --> 00:52:16.354
<v Speaker 3>these evil goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking they call just be that </v>

1015
00:52:18.881 --> 00:52:23.260
<v Speaker 3>angry again and stuff is not partly our </v>
<v Speaker 3>fault.</v>

1016
00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:24.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>

1017
00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:25.374
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of that actually right after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Paris attacks because I saw </v>

1018
00:52:28.081 --> 00:52:32.010
<v Speaker 2>immediately my friends on the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying American foreign policy,</v>

1019
00:52:32.011 --> 00:52:35.100
<v Speaker 2>American foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though two days later,</v>

1020
00:52:35.101 --> 00:52:35.934
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boko Haram killed 140 people and </v>

1021
00:52:38.011 --> 00:52:40.170
<v Speaker 2>obviously that has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy,</v>

1022
00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:41.183
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's this rationalization even </v>

1023
00:52:42.451 --> 00:52:43.284
<v Speaker 2>though at the same time the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>did the Paris attacks were saying this </v>

1024
00:52:47.251 --> 00:52:49.080
<v Speaker 2>is for religious purposes.</v>

1025
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But your friends on the left,</v>

1026
00:52:52.701 --> 00:52:54.440
<v Speaker 3>your source gallery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of narcissism,</v>

1027
00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:55.970
<v Speaker 3>of the history of communism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1028
00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:59.060
<v Speaker 3>There are rational reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can blame,</v>

1029
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:01.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say if,</v>

1030
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:02.300
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1031
00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:04.093
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bombs go off and actually had an office </v>

1032
00:53:05.721 --> 00:53:06.850
<v Speaker 3>in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're friends will have said,</v>

1033
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:07.713
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's their fault.</v>

1034
00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:08.763
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the peanuts cartoon and Mohamad people </v>

1035
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:16.820
<v Speaker 3>slaughtered a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think every supermarket in Paris,</v>

1036
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.040
<v Speaker 3>the hypogastric Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's their fault.</v>

1037
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of Israel,</v>

1038
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.120
<v Speaker 3>because Israel is occupying the West </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bank.</v>

1039
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.210
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you killed us service.</v>

1040
00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.313
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kill the cues that say people who </v>

1041
00:53:28.571 --> 00:53:29.404
<v Speaker 3>are or to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's a football stadium started the </v>

1042
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:34.170
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are slow to a rock concert,</v>

1043
00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:38.880
<v Speaker 3>people are sources of Cambodian </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants on the Parisians well that's</v>

1044
00:53:38.881 --> 00:53:39.714
<v Speaker 3>coming is their fault because we're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite sure American foreign policy be </v>

1045
00:53:42.571 --> 00:53:43.740
<v Speaker 3>friends for on policy.</v>

1046
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These all sorts of rational explanations</v>

1047
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.013
<v Speaker 3>and there's a bit of true freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is every step you change </v>

1048
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:53.303
<v Speaker 3>seems rational and liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every step you take takes you away </v>

1049
00:53:56.521 --> 00:53:59.610
<v Speaker 3>from rationality and liberalism and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>ran into.</v>

1050
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:00.743
<v Speaker 3>They're very murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to explain because you </v>

1051
00:54:02.611 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 3>accepted that whole ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rather turn the standards.</v>

1052
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:07.523
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are not people who are sitting </v>

1053
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:11.700
<v Speaker 3>there saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1054
00:54:11.701 --> 00:54:12.534
<v Speaker 3>we've got a rational grievance like </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's about to file a claim to as a </v>

1055
00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.230
<v Speaker 3>county.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

1056
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.770
<v Speaker 3>They have a youtube channel is having an</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>

1057
00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:25.420
<v Speaker 3>You go and live freely 20 to central,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a last bit of the 20th century,</v>

1058
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:29.670
<v Speaker 3>20th century when you in ideologies to </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of millions of people.</v>

1059
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:33.690
<v Speaker 3>We still don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone like Islamic state says,</v>

1060
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.950
<v Speaker 3>we think we can create heaven on earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

1061
00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:36.793
<v Speaker 3>think we can a caliphate that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>govern the holder and this will be </v>

1062
00:54:39.451 --> 00:54:41.370
<v Speaker 3>paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you do that.</v>

1063
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.370
<v Speaker 3>What's a matter of 1 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2 million,</v>

1064
00:54:44.371 --> 00:54:47.070
<v Speaker 3>10 million people are killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

1065
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.630
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think they're explained.</v>

1066
00:54:48.631 --> 00:54:50.100
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand anything.</v>

1067
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that actually is the ultimate irony </v>

1068
00:54:52.411 --> 00:54:54.810
<v Speaker 2>because on one hand you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1069
00:54:54.811 --> 00:54:56.370
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we took everything,</v>

1070
00:54:56.371 --> 00:54:58.470
<v Speaker 2>if we did whatever it is they want us to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1071
00:54:58.471 --> 00:55:00.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We took all our troops out of here,</v>

1072
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:01.590
<v Speaker 2>we stopped bombing here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1073
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Then suddenly they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd like us more,</v>

1074
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.880
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it really is.</v>

1075
00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.710
<v Speaker 2>It's the most ironic a piece</v>

1076
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:11.940
<v Speaker 3>they want you to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>

1077
00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:13.580
<v Speaker 3>is becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then yes.</v>

1078
00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:16.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here you go.</v>

1079
00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:17.883
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your friends are in California and </v>

1080
00:55:19.171 --> 00:55:19.901
<v Speaker 3>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1081
00:55:19.901 --> 00:55:20.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1082
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they're lovely people.</v>

1083
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:25.870
<v Speaker 3>So some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1084
00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:26.440
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1085
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:30.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they think of themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to you sexist and racist,</v>

1086
00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until you have a phobic.</v>

1087
00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they're fine on trans issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1088
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:41.430
<v Speaker 3>I bet some of them don't even get me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they will then through thinking that</v>

1089
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:47.360
<v Speaker 3>being logical end up defending the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>

1090
00:55:47.771 --> 00:55:48.604
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobic in liberal movements on the </v>

1091
00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.213
<v Speaker 3>and you certainly the point made by me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a very brilliant French </v>

1092
00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.900
<v Speaker 3>philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually they're very narcissistic way,</v>

1093
00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all.</v>

1094
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Central is the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1095
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 3>if something terrible happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be down to us.</v>

1096
00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Know the people in the rest of the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>have their own agency,</v>

1097
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:14.910
<v Speaker 3>not people in the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cup I guess is wicked little as well.</v>

1098
00:56:14.911 --> 00:56:18.850
<v Speaker 3>You can say our infant say are children </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are goaded by us.</v>

1099
00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.210
<v Speaker 3>It's all down to what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are still.</v>

1100
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the narcissist ego,</v>

1101
00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:25.750
<v Speaker 3>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that sent for before.</v>

1102
00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:26.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what I had done with and he </v>

1103
00:56:27.931 --> 00:56:28.741
<v Speaker 2>illustrated that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1104
00:56:28.741 --> 00:56:29.574
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world could go to hell in a </v>

1105
00:56:29.761 --> 00:56:32.040
<v Speaker 2>handbasket and it'll have nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with America.</v>

1106
00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:34.190
<v Speaker 2>You just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just child.</v>

1107
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.840
<v Speaker 2>It's childlike thinking of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:36.833
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so increasing steadily treats Muslim </v>

1109
00:56:38.951 --> 00:56:43.410
<v Speaker 3>populations as children isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1110
00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:46.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

1111
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.200
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're adults.</v>

1112
00:56:47.201 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 3>We're wearing these white western </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europeans.</v>

1113
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:52.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can handle satire.</v>

1114
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:55.240
<v Speaker 3>We can handle all leaders and Godson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bishops,</v>

1115
00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:56.740
<v Speaker 3>clerics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1116
00:56:56.741 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 3>you can't do those Muslims like </v>
<v Speaker 3>toddlers.</v>

1117
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.300
<v Speaker 3>You're like violent little delinquent </v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

1118
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.270
<v Speaker 3>You've shown them a cartoon and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>start blowing the place up.</v>

1119
00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ironically,</v>

1120
00:57:05.541 --> 00:57:09.890
<v Speaker 2>that's what George W dot Bush called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>soft bigotry of low expectations,</v>

1121
00:57:09.891 --> 00:57:13.030
<v Speaker 2>which I keep crediting Bill Maher with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But apparently it was George W Bush,</v>

1122
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:16.720
<v Speaker 3>which is mind blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's is a very,</v>

1123
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:19.570
<v Speaker 3>very good for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's true actually.</v>

1124
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:21.830
<v Speaker 3>It's worse than the soft bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1125
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:22.683
<v Speaker 3>it does keep people down because look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the men and women watching your </v>

1126
00:57:27.071 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 3>program in California doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>help them when they're going out looking</v>

1127
00:57:31.091 --> 00:57:32.620
<v Speaker 3>for a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1128
00:57:32.621 --> 00:57:33.250
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1129
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:35.540
<v Speaker 3>looking to get on in life or wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create respect.</v>

1130
00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 3>We want to be crazy recalls if liberals </v>
<v Speaker 3>all saying,</v>

1131
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:39.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1132
00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:40.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very,</v>

1133
00:57:40.901 --> 00:57:42.400
<v Speaker 3>very funny people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people,</v>

1134
00:57:42.401 --> 00:57:45.240
<v Speaker 3>you have to be very careful what you say</v>
<v Speaker 3>in French car tuned up,</v>

1135
00:57:45.241 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 3>blow the top of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't help them.</v>

1136
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:52.420
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't help them be full citizens to</v>
<v Speaker 3>increase in a totally different way from</v>

1137
00:57:52.421 --> 00:57:53.254
<v Speaker 3>everyone else.</v>

1138
00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1139
00:57:54.381 --> 00:57:56.150
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have one more for Ya.</v>

1140
00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I could do this for five hours with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'll have to.</v>

1141
00:57:58.610 --> 00:57:59.443
<v Speaker 2>You'll have to come on again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to have your tea and go to </v>

1142
00:58:05.221 --> 00:58:06.540
<v Speaker 2>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll end with this.</v>

1143
00:58:06.541 --> 00:58:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wrote what's left in 2007.</v>

1144
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was eight years ago.</v>

1145
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.770
<v Speaker 2>So let's fast forward eight years from </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1146
00:58:13.771 --> 00:58:15.180
<v Speaker 2>It's 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>23.</v>

1147
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Give me a little hope if you can find </v>
<v Speaker 2>some hope,</v>

1148
00:58:18.511 --> 00:58:19.344
<v Speaker 2>but if you can't then give me where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think we're going to be at eight years </v>

1149
00:58:21.271 --> 00:58:22.104
<v Speaker 2>from now.</v>

1150
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

1151
00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:27.860
<v Speaker 3>that was quite hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on.</v>

1152
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:28.733
<v Speaker 3>I wrote that lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope it will run ally on a liberal </v>

1153
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:38.140
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals,</v>
