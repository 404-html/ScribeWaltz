1
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>We're officially entering the completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane phase of the 2016 election.</v>

2
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>I know it feels like we've been here for</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a year now,</v>

3
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>but if you think the political theater </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been crazy so far,</v>

4
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ain't seen nothing yet.</v>

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>It seems that everyone you know is </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to crack,</v>

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:19.104
<v Speaker 1>you could just open up twitter or </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook and every second of the day it </v>

8
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>seems like someone is writing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.423
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has a clue as to what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and you don't have to take my </v>

10
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:30.414
<v Speaker 1>word for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just turn on CNN or Fox or MSNBC and </v>

11
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>listen to the pundits who got everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong for the last six months.</v>

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Explain how the next six months are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go.</v>

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>These are the experts in what I have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

14
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.293
<v Speaker 1>Last week I discussed what I consider to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the biggest risk of a trump </v>

15
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>presidency.</v>

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>We have a salesman doing a hell of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sales job,</v>

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but we really don't know what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>product we're going to end up with.</v>

18
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>In the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As some of you pointed out,</v>

19
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.193
<v Speaker 1>the notion of not knowing how someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>will act once in office is actually no </v>

20
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:02.484
<v Speaker 1>different than with most politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pretty much all will say anything </v>

21
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>to get elected and then do whatever they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can to stay in power.</v>

22
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.493
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this endless loop of promises made and </v>

23
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:13.854
<v Speaker 1>broken by politicians who just want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in office is exactly what has led </v>

24
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:18.594
<v Speaker 1>to the rise of Donald trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are sick of the status quo and </v>

25
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>are willing to turn into a reality TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>host as their savior.</v>

26
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.823
<v Speaker 1>Some of you pointed out if my question </v>
<v Speaker 1>of whether trump would even believe in </v>

27
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>our three branches of government was </v>
<v Speaker 1>legit.</v>

28
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Many presidents have done plenty via </v>
<v Speaker 1>executive action,</v>

29
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:35.784
<v Speaker 1>effectively circumventing congress and </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually like in the case of Barack </v>

30
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.223
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they against using executive actions </v>

31
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>until they're in office themselves.</v>

32
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.543
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents shouldn't get all the blame </v>

33
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:46.524
<v Speaker 1>for executive actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if this congress has been </v>

34
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>eager to get anything done with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

35
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.043
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of WHO's to blame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though the average person sees usurping </v>

36
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>of power and Washington gridlock in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their minds,</v>

37
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>is a regular politician going to get our</v>
<v Speaker 1>country out of that pattern?</v>

38
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an over the top businessman might.</v>

39
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.440
<v Speaker 1>While we can parse out why trump has </v>
<v Speaker 1>risen,</v>

40
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>the fact is he is here and all of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to acknowledge there is a political</v>

41
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>movement brewing on the horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may not be the one you would like,</v>

42
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.363
<v Speaker 1>but trying to silence trump supporters </v>
<v Speaker 1>by blocking roads to rallies or by </v>

43
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>labeling all his supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racist isn't going to stop his rise.</v>

44
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to make his support that</v>

45
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:27.834
<v Speaker 1>much stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I always talk about the </v>

46
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>battle of ideas on this show and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only why I talk about them,</v>

47
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:35.124
<v Speaker 1>it's why I invite guests from all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the political map to share in their </v>

48
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>views and guess what?</v>

49
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they say things that I don't </v>

50
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 1>agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't shout them down.</v>

51
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>The only way we can ever make progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>is by hearing others.</v>

52
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>This should be the number one principle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being a progressive,</v>

53
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>but these days it's not even on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>top 10 list.</v>

54
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.183
<v Speaker 1>If you hate trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think his comments about Muslims </v>

55
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>are horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think his border wall is terrible</v>

56
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>and you think his general disposition is</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting,</v>

57
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>then use your speech to promote a </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate with better ideas.</v>

58
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>If you like Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helped Bernie get the vote out.</v>

59
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>If you like Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then tell your friends why.</v>

60
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>If you like Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're the only one,</v>

61
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>but good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

62
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.034
<v Speaker 1>we've never needed a battle of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>more in this country than we do right </v>

63
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>now and we shouldn't be afraid to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

64
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but here's the scary part.</v>

65
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>A battle of ideas means actually hearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>people out,</v>

66
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.253
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use your free speech to protest </v>

67
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>trump or anyone else that's as American </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it gets,</v>

68
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>but big goddamn deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're offended,</v>

69
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>suck it up and move on like you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have learned in fourth grade.</v>

70
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the people who blocked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road to the trump rally changed the mind</v>

71
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>of one person that they stopped from </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting there?</v>

72
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.593
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually did the complete opposite </v>

73
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't have a battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

74
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>They had a battle of Mad Max fury road </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a highway in Arizona.</v>

75
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.993
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is the infamous </v>
<v Speaker 1>notorious and always outspoken Milo </v>

76
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.283
<v Speaker 1>Yiannopoulos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo is a provocateur who's rise to </v>

77
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:04.354
<v Speaker 1>start them in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mirrors trumps which might explain his </v>

78
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:07.654
<v Speaker 1>support for the Donald Milo is using all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tools of the Internet to spread his </v>

79
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>message against the authoritarians.</v>

80
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Not only does he always get a reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's paid the price,</v>

81
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.123
<v Speaker 1>losing his blue twitter verification </v>
<v Speaker 1>check and being protested at several </v>

82
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>universities on his current college </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour.</v>

83
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.903
<v Speaker 1>He sort of a micro trump and that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses the media to a fuel his ascent to </v>

84
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>start them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I have many differences of opinion</v>

85
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:33.034
<v Speaker 1>with Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find ourselves as allies in the war </v>

86
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 1>on free speech and against ideologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would silence us both.</v>

87
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>There is way more that unites us as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and as a country.</v>

88
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Then the media will ever tell us </v>
<v Speaker 1>decency,</v>

89
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and humanity just aren't very clickable.</v>

90
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 1>For riots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protests and violence will always be the</v>

91
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>lead story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus fueling the fire of intolerance.</v>

92
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>That's why I said you ain't seen nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

93
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>We could end up with a contested </v>
<v Speaker 1>convention for the Republicans,</v>

94
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>a super delegate revolt by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats,</v>

95
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>a sudden third party candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or who knows what else.</v>

96
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.113
<v Speaker 1>The important thing is that we learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect one another while this insane </v>

97
00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>process unfolds around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If our leaders aren't going to be great,</v>

98
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 1>then it's time for us to do some leading</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

99
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos is a senior staff </v>
<v Speaker 1>editor for Breitbart News,</v>

100
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:24.364
<v Speaker 1>a speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and has been named the ultimate trolls </v>

101
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.440
<v Speaker 1>by the fusion network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos.</v>

102
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for having me.</v>

103
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was supposed to come back.</v>

104
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 1>You are the second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.483
<v Speaker 1>maybe the third or the fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you want to be first at </v>

106
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:38.630
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

107
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm joint generally am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

108
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:42.150
<v Speaker 1>it's better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm normally way ahead of my time.</v>

109
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.013
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm normally so earlier everything that </v>

110
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:45.364
<v Speaker 1>people think I'm crazy until six months </v>
<v Speaker 1>later than I used to have a guy that I </v>

111
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 1>wrote comedy with who used to always </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

112
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:51.544
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so ahead of the curve or behind </v>

113
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:53.464
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's,</v>

114
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this one.</v>

115
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>So unpopular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

116
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>We've had a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of repeat guests,</v>

117
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>but in a way you're sort of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

118
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Not that I have to inflate your ego </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know you like that,</v>

119
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.690
<v Speaker 1>but a tremendous amount of stuff has </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened since we had you on.</v>

120
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>So you were on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the middle of October.</v>

121
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>So we're only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're five or six months away from that.</v>

122
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going great by the way.</v>

123
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

124
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot has happened in this space </v>

125
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>that we exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cultural libertarian space.</v>

126
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>So we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a lot to get to,</v>

127
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>but let's start with what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

128
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.303
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 1>this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

130
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:30.494
<v Speaker 1>there was this terror attack in Brussels</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the airport and at a train station </v>

131
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.080
<v Speaker 1>over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>it's still unfolding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right now we're taping this,</v>

133
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:39.760
<v Speaker 1>it's Tuesday afternoon here in Los </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles.</v>

134
00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:41.890
<v Speaker 1>So some stuff obviously will change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

135
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just give me your initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts on what's going on.</v>

136
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.963
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

137
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>this is sort of what liberalism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>welcomed into Europe.</v>

138
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

139
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the excuse making that's been </v>

140
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:54.554
<v Speaker 2>made for radical Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has prevented us from fighting </v>

141
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:56.984
<v Speaker 2>this problem by people who lie about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>source of these people in new stations </v>

142
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 2>who refuse to accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

143
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.284
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these attacks have anything to do with </v>

144
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Islam and the people wouldn't even use </v>
<v Speaker 2>the word Muslim before it happens.</v>

145
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 2>This is preventing us from fixing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

146
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:10.064
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is preventing people from taking </v>

147
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 2>out of adequate security precautions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.630
<v Speaker 2>looking after themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe now,</v>

149
00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:16.464
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcoming in millions of people from </v>

150
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.853
<v Speaker 2>alien cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whilst the establishment refuses to </v>

151
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:21.854
<v Speaker 2>accept that these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people's belief systems are just </v>

152
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.910
<v Speaker 2>dramatically incompatible with our own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

153
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:28.744
<v Speaker 2>the regular citizenry as being aligned </v>
<v Speaker 2>to and light about constantly all the </v>

154
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the media on this stuff,</v>

155
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.103
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have population that is not able to </v>

156
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:37.064
<v Speaker 2>protect itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is not adequately informed about </v>

157
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 2>the risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dangers of radical Islam.</v>

158
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 2>And I'm the problem in Europe is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff is now happening everywhere.</v>

159
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 2>No one is safe anywhere in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening in Paris,</v>

160
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Speaker 2>has happened in London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening in process.</v>

161
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.670
<v Speaker 2>No one is safe from this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does it go?</v>

162
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 2>What our politicians leap to the airways</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

163
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I really want to make it clear that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with Islam.</v>

164
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:00.020
<v Speaker 2>What it does it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a gay man,</v>

165
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrified by the prospect of mass </v>

166
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.183
<v Speaker 2>Muslim immigration into Europe is one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reasons I spend so much time in </v>

167
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 2>America now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be there anymore.</v>

168
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's back up a little bit.</v>

169
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:09.784
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that your initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to that is to talk about our </v>

170
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:17.030
<v Speaker 1>reaction to it rather than the ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.873
<v Speaker 1>just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprises are not denying the ideology </v>

172
00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:19.720
<v Speaker 1>or obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

173
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.553
<v Speaker 2>nothing surprises me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we surprised that Muslims are </v>

174
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:23.970
<v Speaker 2>blowing things up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do,</v>

175
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.650
<v Speaker 2>like I don't care about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:26.410
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

177
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.243
<v Speaker 2>it's a horrific for the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are on the receiving end of this </v>

178
00:08:29.881 --> 00:08:30.810
<v Speaker 2>terrorist stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

179
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Anybody surprised that isis blew </v>
<v Speaker 2>something up,</v>

180
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:33.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

181
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.273
<v Speaker 1>So I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna save you a little of Internet </v>

182
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:36.434
<v Speaker 1>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do make the distinction between the </v>

183
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 1>nominal Muslim person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average person that's a Muslim,</v>

184
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't take their religion.</v>

185
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to do me that favor.</v>

186
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.513
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care too much for that </v>

187
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:49.060
<v Speaker 2>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not extremists.</v>

188
00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:52.240
<v Speaker 2>It's not radical Islamists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people.</v>

189
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:53.770
<v Speaker 2>The security services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

190
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.610
<v Speaker 2>worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

191
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are the problem.</v>

192
00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:59.030
<v Speaker 2>It is the silent majority Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do nothing on,</v>

193
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 2>in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have no peace movement,</v>

194
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 2>no resistance to their own extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements.</v>

195
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Just like the progressive left in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>West and 1111 countries.</v>

196
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 2>You and I could be killed for who we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

197
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 2>That's not isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is mainstream Muslim culture.</v>

198
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.890
<v Speaker 2>And we are importing that stuff into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe by millions.</v>

199
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.853
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't make a meaningful distinction </v>

200
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 2>between these things because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>

201
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.423
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any reason to import these </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures into liberal Western </v>

202
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 2>democracies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see no reason to do it whatsoever.</v>

203
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 2>And as Brigitte Gabriel wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very brilliantly said,</v>

204
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 2>in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the peaceful majority are irrelevant.</v>

205
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 2>It is not the peaceful majority that </v>
<v Speaker 2>blow up buildings.</v>

206
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 2>It is the extremists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now in the world,</v>

207
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:37.974
<v Speaker 2>all of this stuff is coming from one </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and one religion and I don't </v>

208
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 2>want it here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do we do about that?</v>

209
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:47.391
<v Speaker 2>Then what do you actually do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't bomb these people into oblivion</v>

210
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 2>with radical part of this as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>

211
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you be an evil ideology?</v>

212
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to welcome one point 4 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million of them into Germany.</v>

213
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.310
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to lie to people about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what Islam is and what Muslims believe,</v>

214
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 2>which the press and politicians do all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

215
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.483
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to intervene in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries where it's not necessarily </v>

216
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:12.930
<v Speaker 2>where we don't need to and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supported the Iraq war,</v>

217
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:13.764
<v Speaker 2>but some of the other things we do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East are not necessarily and </v>

218
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:18.570
<v Speaker 2>just drum up this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this western hatred,</v>

219
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:19.763
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

220
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 2>some of what's gone on has something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with the West,</v>

221
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:23.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

222
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.330
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we're responsible for it.</v>

223
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody has that parsing out.</v>

224
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Blamed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you say you do see some connection,</v>

225
00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you would be an idiot to deny it.</v>

226
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have been dealing with of idiots here</v>

227
00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:37.390
<v Speaker 2>on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of it is Georgia.</v>

228
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.603
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them say the reason I do your </v>

229
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:42.530
<v Speaker 2>show you on the very few liberal brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

230
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.820
<v Speaker 2>And there are starting to not think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a compliment.</v>

231
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.863
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people say that to me and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to think maybe that's what I </v>

232
00:10:47.891 --> 00:10:49.200
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a compliment?</v>

233
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:49.951
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

234
00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:51.780
<v Speaker 2>it puts you up to average.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a compliment?</v>

235
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 2>No idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No idea.</v>

236
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

237
00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 2>the problem is not just radical Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is Islam,</v>

238
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:01.224
<v Speaker 2>there are structural problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this religion that mean it is </v>

239
00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:03.054
<v Speaker 2>incompatible with modern free western </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal democracy we live in and </v>

240
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:06.954
<v Speaker 2>particularly for you and I as a for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and me and there's also a problem for </v>

241
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:10.500
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

242
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.740
<v Speaker 2>There are very serious problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic culture,</v>

243
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.723
<v Speaker 2>not Islamist jihadist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a extremism and of course that plays </v>

244
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:20.004
<v Speaker 2>itself out and played itself out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>streets of Brussels and it plays itself </v>

245
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:23.244
<v Speaker 2>out with far too much regularity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with Islam there is a problem and </v>

246
00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:27.444
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants to talk about it and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you tried to do earlier to save me from </v>

247
00:11:29.611 --> 00:11:30.444
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it because now I respect </v>

248
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:34.830
<v Speaker 2>that I don't want it because I've got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where I'm thinking,</v>

249
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:36.450
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the West,</v>

250
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.480
<v Speaker 2>the West that Islam hates so much is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what has given us gay rights.</v>

251
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 2>It has provided that for women it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>given women the vote.</v>

252
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 2>It has ended slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

253
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the case everywhere.</v>

254
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere in the world it has given gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and women.</v>

255
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:49.224
<v Speaker 2>All of the rights we now enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is effective blanket equality in </v>

256
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>in the West for all of these people</v>

257
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.273
<v Speaker 3>and every other minority to exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>importing Muslims is going to turn the </v>

258
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 3>clock back and this is what you talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about when you,</v>

259
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 3>when you coin a coin and popularized </v>
<v Speaker 3>this phrase,</v>

260
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 3>regressive left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which came from this show,</v>

261
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't go far enough.</v>

262
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.860
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does the regressive left means?</v>

263
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 3>It means it's going to take us backwards</v>
<v Speaker 3>into an era of hatred and bigotry.</v>

264
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left seems to want to import Muslims</v>

265
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 3>by the millions into all of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

266
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 3>That's the regressive consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just terrorism.</v>

267
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think is going on with </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people?</v>

268
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 3>I know many of these people very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've worked with a lot of these people.</v>

269
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.573
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this idea judge a man by his </v>

270
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:33.844
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

271
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 3>but this ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even this morning on twitter as I</v>

272
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:38.224
<v Speaker 3>was scrolling through all the craziness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that every time there's a terror attack </v>

273
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get every,</v>

274
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>avenue of craziness.</v>

275
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.410
<v Speaker 3>I saw someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a girl,</v>

276
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.483
<v Speaker 3>a 20 something year old girl in Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She actually tweeted that the Hashtag </v>

277
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Stop Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Hashtag itself.</v>

278
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:54.723
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's worse than what actually </v>

279
00:12:56.561 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mean that I'm not kidding.</v>

280
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see this every time you see this,</v>

281
00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:02.584
<v Speaker 3>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the left believes that words </v>

282
00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 3>have power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have.</v>

283
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.243
<v Speaker 3>They think that you can stop somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>from being homophobic by banning the </v>

284
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:09.970
<v Speaker 3>word gay from the playground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

285
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.610
<v Speaker 3>they think that you can end racism by </v>
<v Speaker 3>banning the n word.</v>

286
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:13.683
<v Speaker 3>They think that if you shape language </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a control culture that you can just </v>

287
00:13:17.241 --> 00:13:18.280
<v Speaker 3>stamp out bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

288
00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 3>that's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point of a civilized society,</v>

289
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:21.531
<v Speaker 3>the point of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

290
00:13:21.531 --> 00:13:22.364
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of etiquette and the point of </v>

291
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:28.411
<v Speaker 3>negotiating the world around us and </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiating with other people is to live</v>

292
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.480
<v Speaker 3>with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Despite our prejudices.</v>

293
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:35.140
<v Speaker 3>And despite our differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the purpose of a civilized society ought</v>

294
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:37.690
<v Speaker 3>to be to enable everybody to live </v>
<v Speaker 3>together in harmony,</v>

295
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:38.524
<v Speaker 3>which is why I hate what the gay lobby </v>
<v Speaker 3>does when it bullies and ridicules </v>

296
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians not going away.</v>

297
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.183
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna Bully Christianity out </v>

298
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:47.254
<v Speaker 3>of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not gonna Ridicule Christianity </v>

299
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 3>of existence just because buzzfeed </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't like people who believe in God.</v>

300
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Now he's had everybody to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

301
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 3>and we were doing a good job of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

302
00:13:56.261 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 3>the West is doing a pretty good job of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that right up until we started importing</v>

303
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:00.650
<v Speaker 3>Muslims that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

304
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.713
<v Speaker 3>you're giving me a lot there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sort of is going to be the through </v>

305
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:05.950
<v Speaker 3>line for everything else we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss.</v>

306
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

307
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:06.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

308
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:07.663
<v Speaker 3>let's just jump into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just go into some of the free </v>

309
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:09.574
<v Speaker 3>speech stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of things have happened to you </v>

310
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.250
<v Speaker 3>over the past few months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>

311
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 3>your star has risen the last you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

312
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:18.520
<v Speaker 3>you had a blue twitter verification </v>
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>

313
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 3>You do not have it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>

314
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:21.784
<v Speaker 3>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only public person to have their </v>

315
00:14:24.881 --> 00:14:27.040
<v Speaker 3>blue verification check for those that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what it means.</v>

316
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it basically means you are who you are,</v>

317
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:33.220
<v Speaker 3>so that if you're a celebrity or you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just saying you are who you are,</v>

318
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

319
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.410
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

320
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.273
<v Speaker 3>but you had yours remove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's been any other </v>

321
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:43.210
<v Speaker 3>case of that happening and it clearly </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a punitive measure.</v>

322
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.460
<v Speaker 3>So just real quick though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

323
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.423
<v Speaker 3>I just want people to saying we're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this to be so inside my little </v>

324
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:48.910
<v Speaker 3>twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got whatever,</v>

325
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bigger issue because </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter is using,</v>

326
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.993
<v Speaker 2>I'm using a mechanism to protect public </v>
<v Speaker 2>figures like us from impersonation and </v>

327
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:58.064
<v Speaker 2>also their privilege concerns when </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's speaking to me in my role as </v>

328
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:00.854
<v Speaker 2>a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have an expectation of privacy and </v>

329
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.133
<v Speaker 2>of legal privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now people are deeming people with my </v>

330
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:05.654
<v Speaker 2>name on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're giving personal information </v>

331
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:08.660
<v Speaker 2>about their lives that exposes twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>to liability too,</v>

332
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:10.480
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was very serious,</v>

333
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why,</v>

334
00:15:11.851 --> 00:15:14.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's a good idea to have public </v>
<v Speaker 2>figures,</v>

335
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>verify,</v>

336
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 2>but they used it as an ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapon.</v>

337
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 2>And now when I went to the White House </v>
<v Speaker 2>to ask about this,</v>

338
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.113
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asked Josh earnest about this and he </v>

339
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:22.874
<v Speaker 2>said very interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought the president would be the </v>

340
00:15:25.641 --> 00:15:26.474
<v Speaker 2>first to affirm that the success of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these social networking companies rests </v>

341
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:31.970
<v Speaker 2>on their commitment to first amendment </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>

342
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:32.804
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't saying you can enforce the </v>

343
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 2>first amendment are private companies.</v>

344
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.173
<v Speaker 2>And most I'd get thrown out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative club if I've tried to </v>

345
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 2>suggest that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just to be clear,</v>

346
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 2>the first amendment is about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government taking away your free speech.</v>

347
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Now people are taking away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

348
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.153
<v Speaker 2>the late Aaron Swartz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the founder of Reddit said censorship </v>

349
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:50.684
<v Speaker 2>has a meaning outside the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>when private companies have a monopoly </v>

350
00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:54.224
<v Speaker 2>on certain kinds of speech now to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit and he does not only because it has </v>

351
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 2>such a stranglehold on journalism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media,</v>

352
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:02.120
<v Speaker 2>but also business invented entirely new </v>
<v Speaker 2>public square.</v>

353
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.373
<v Speaker 2>If you were in a pub and you make a joke</v>
<v Speaker 2>that involves race or sex or sex or </v>

354
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Publican doesn't like it,</v>

355
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:12.560
<v Speaker 2>you can go to another pub down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no other twitter,</v>

356
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.593
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a fundamentally important part </v>

357
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:16.514
<v Speaker 2>of our media and our democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're controlling basically one of </v>

358
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:20.310
<v Speaker 2>the big highways of information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

359
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.830
<v Speaker 2>And it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes with responsibility.</v>

360
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:23.690
<v Speaker 2>It comes responsibility to use this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to two things.</v>

361
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.550
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be honest and say,</v>

362
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.500
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a liberal space,</v>

363
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.291
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservative,</v>

364
00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:29.480
<v Speaker 2>sooner or later you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>banned.</v>

365
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.403
<v Speaker 2>We don't really want you here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can stay for as long as you </v>

366
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't piss us off too much.</v>

367
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.013
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I pissed them off too much and they </v>

368
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:38.450
<v Speaker 2>have banned people not all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always in one direction.</v>

369
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:39.870
<v Speaker 2>You always conservatively band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

370
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I guess suspended now and again because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I make jokes about feminists,</v>

371
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.190
<v Speaker 2>feminists or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I said that I,</v>

372
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.660
<v Speaker 2>I said that I'd been appointed social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice editor of Buzzfeed as a church.</v>

373
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people took you seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was quiet.</v>

374
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 2>It was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Idiots,</v>

375
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.450
<v Speaker 2>idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

376
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 2>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then immediately after that,</v>

377
00:16:57.081 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 2>when people were tweeting Ben Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the boss and say,</v>

378
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:01.730
<v Speaker 2>how dare you?</v>

379
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Hi this man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never reading breastfeed again.</v>

380
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.560
<v Speaker 2>When I knew that it had taken hold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I,</v>

381
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.430
<v Speaker 2>then I started the hashtag feminism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>

382
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did it polls,</v>

383
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:09.584
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather your children had </v>

384
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:13.220
<v Speaker 2>feminism or cancer until 22,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people voted and they voted for cancer.</v>

385
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>And I had cancer survivors email,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

386
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.290
<v Speaker 2>acting may say I'm a two time cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>survivor and I still chose counseling.</v>

387
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was funny.</v>

388
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

389
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.460
<v Speaker 2>They didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't like that very much.</v>

390
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:25.280
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point is,</v>

391
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 2>if you are these days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irreverent,</v>

392
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.030
<v Speaker 2>mischievous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provocative,</v>

393
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.893
<v Speaker 2>and to do those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be conservative because the </v>

394
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.690
<v Speaker 2>establishment is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

395
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:33.524
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not just liberal but progressive </v>

396
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:36.390
<v Speaker 2>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

397
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.543
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be punk these days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be cool and dissident and </v>

398
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.970
<v Speaker 2>mischievous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be conservative.</v>

399
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.833
<v Speaker 2>And if you are that on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sooner or later you can lose your </v>

400
00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:44.270
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>

401
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

402
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.600
<v Speaker 2>they should be honest about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or they should,</v>

403
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 2>they should enforce free speech and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>this weird.</v>

404
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.113
<v Speaker 2>There's weird definition of free speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Jack Dorsey seems to have the CEO </v>

405
00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:55.044
<v Speaker 2>of twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seems to think that it's a sort of </v>

406
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 2>freedom from rather than freedom too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So free speech on twitter.</v>

407
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:04.710
<v Speaker 2>It means freedom from conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom from different points of view,</v>

408
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.650
<v Speaker 2>and it plays into the safe space and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger warning culture that I know that</v>

409
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:10.680
<v Speaker 2>you and your listeners know no more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough about already.</v>

410
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:11.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

411
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:12.683
<v Speaker 2>it's freedom from ever having to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to anything that might make you </v>

412
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 2>feel uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

413
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:18.890
<v Speaker 2>that's not what freedom of speeches and </v>
<v Speaker 2>for him,</v>

414
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.950
<v Speaker 2>he needs to stop lying to users that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>twister is,</v>

415
00:18:22.951 --> 00:18:23.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the free speech.</v>

416
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:24.960
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the free speech party.</v>

417
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.943
<v Speaker 2>It's very clear if you step off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go off reservation on most of </v>

418
00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:31.530
<v Speaker 2>these social networks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be punished.</v>

419
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 2>And facebook too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

420
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.150
<v Speaker 2>is teaming up with Angela Merkel in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

421
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.253
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody knows it's now to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensor perfectly reasonable mainstream </v>

422
00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:40.854
<v Speaker 2>discussion from citizens who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned about mass immigration into </v>

423
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:44.274
<v Speaker 2>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about millions of people coming into </v>

424
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:48.570
<v Speaker 2>their country about the rape epidemics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about all sorts of awful things that are</v>

425
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:51.990
<v Speaker 2>happening to young German girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facebook won't let you talk about it,</v>

426
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:52.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

427
00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.870
<v Speaker 1>prove that is true and that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>making this up.</v>

428
00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I've had to make things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

429
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:58.263
<v Speaker 1>But I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two instances where I have a </v>

430
00:18:59.441 --> 00:19:02.500
<v Speaker 1>decent connection at facebook and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>had two instances.</v>

431
00:19:02.501 --> 00:19:05.290
<v Speaker 1>One where my former guest feisal site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almodovar,</v>

432
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.810
<v Speaker 1>who's been here twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is from Iraq,</v>

433
00:19:07.811 --> 00:19:10.930
<v Speaker 1>a refugee from Iraq who is now living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the west and fight through his,</v>

434
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.773
<v Speaker 1>around his page got banned because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people didn't like that he was speaking </v>

435
00:19:14.411 --> 00:19:15.820
<v Speaker 1>out against Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

436
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:19.990
<v Speaker 1>And then I had a group of atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims that their page got banned as if</v>

437
00:19:19.991 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 1>it was hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying,</v>

438
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:23.483
<v Speaker 1>I'm just given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want people to understand the </v>

439
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:25.743
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not just</v>

440
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.233
<v Speaker 2>do to everybody and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't even can now about </v>

441
00:19:29.521 --> 00:19:31.440
<v Speaker 2>violating their own sacred tenants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

442
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this identity Marion nonsense,</v>

443
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:35.730
<v Speaker 2>what you're sort of in a protected class</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a,</v>

444
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:36.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as liberals or consent.</v>

445
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:38.760
<v Speaker 2>If you're a woman or if you're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're black or whatever.</v>

446
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are universities that are there,</v>

447
00:19:41.241 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 2>there are university students who are no</v>
<v Speaker 2>platforming,</v>

448
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:45.480
<v Speaker 2>black transsexuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

449
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:46.314
<v Speaker 2>they get invited by Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This stuff has become incidentally </v>

450
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 2>happened last week and they got him up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't mind.</v>

451
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.260
<v Speaker 2>They don't mind if you're gay or if your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brown skinned or whatever.</v>

452
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.320
<v Speaker 2>What they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they will not tolerate is diversity</v>

453
00:19:58.321 --> 00:19:59.370
<v Speaker 2>of opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

454
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.260
<v Speaker 2>the diversity of skin color has gone out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the window.</v>

455
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to cry victim,</v>

456
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:04.680
<v Speaker 2>if you want to pretend you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed class,</v>

457
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 2>you'll get all sorts of clothes from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

458
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.720
<v Speaker 2>You'll get all sorts of rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't care so much about that.</v>

459
00:20:09.721 --> 00:20:11.310
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they really don't want,</v>

460
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.970
<v Speaker 2>what they are terrified of because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't fight it with facts,</v>

461
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 2>is libertarian and conservative points </v>
<v Speaker 2>of view and that freedom from ever being</v>

462
00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:21.144
<v Speaker 2>challenged on anything that freedom from</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever having to encounter something with </v>

463
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:25.404
<v Speaker 2>which you might disagree or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that might make you feel uncomfortable </v>

464
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:31.500
<v Speaker 2>or something that might ridicule you is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the definition of freedom that has taken</v>

465
00:20:31.501 --> 00:20:34.560
<v Speaker 2>hold on the left in America today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is a poisonous.</v>

466
00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:35.330
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

467
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is entirely antithetical to </v>

468
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:38.363
<v Speaker 2>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the free and open exchange of ideas </v>

469
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:42.230
<v Speaker 2>to classical liberalism to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

470
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.183
<v Speaker 2>intellectually</v>

471
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.230
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>

472
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.520
<v Speaker 1>that classical liberalism has really </v>
<v Speaker 1>been pushed aside where I'm at anymore,</v>

473
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 1>but nobody really understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody even knows that it exists.</v>

474
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I think the university is it</v>

475
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.330
<v Speaker 2>speak up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

476
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:54.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

477
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:55.783
<v Speaker 2>I'm on my tour at the moment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities and the thing that has </v>

478
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.680
<v Speaker 2>amazed me is the extent to which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty at these universities don't just</v>

479
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:05.920
<v Speaker 2>refuse to expose their students to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different points of view.</v>

480
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't just ridicule conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>points of view.</v>

481
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.950
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

482
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

483
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been for awhile,</v>

484
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.080
<v Speaker 2>fairly well known that the number one </v>
<v Speaker 2>textbook economics textbook,</v>

485
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country in America,</v>

486
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.131
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

487
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:23.050
<v Speaker 2>on set lists is Karl Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

488
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.943
<v Speaker 2>And say what you want about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a conservative talking </v>

489
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's becoming increasingly clear,</v>

490
00:21:28.481 --> 00:21:29.314
<v Speaker 2>especially at liberal arts colleges that</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any sort of federal </v>

491
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:32.300
<v Speaker 2>regulations about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

492
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.990
<v Speaker 2>the sorts of things that the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get involved in.</v>

493
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:37.240
<v Speaker 2>What they teach and these liberal arts </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges,</v>

494
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:39.550
<v Speaker 2>the professors don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative points of view,</v>

495
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:40.384
<v Speaker 2>let alone teach their students when I go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to these colleges and I suggest that </v>

496
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:44.703
<v Speaker 2>perhaps you don't have to give 75 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of your earnings away to the </v>

497
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:48.790
<v Speaker 2>government for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend it on feminists dance therapy.</v>

498
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

499
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps this wage gap stuff isn't real </v>

500
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:52.790
<v Speaker 2>after all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

501
00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.623
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the students look at me weird </v>

502
00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:57.610
<v Speaker 2>like slack jawed horror shock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise.</v>

503
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a revelation to them.</v>

504
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.613
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that somebody might come and </v>

505
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:03.244
<v Speaker 2>actually ask for evidence based policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and evidence based beliefs rather than </v>

506
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 2>this sort of bizarre ideology that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being fed at the moment,</v>

507
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.293
<v Speaker 2>which is only really flourishing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the safe space culture and the </v>

508
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:17.494
<v Speaker 2>trigger warning culture because it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>never be interrogated because it can </v>

509
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:20.410
<v Speaker 2>never be challenged because it can never</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

510
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:21.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

511
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.700
<v Speaker 2>it can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

512
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Nobody is allowed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

513
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:27.100
<v Speaker 2>what about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

514
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:27.841
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

515
00:22:27.841 --> 00:22:29.940
<v Speaker 2>you're suggesting that women get paid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

516
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about this?</v>

517
00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.250
<v Speaker 1>The economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't say this by you,</v>

518
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.113
<v Speaker 1>by Milo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Showing up to a college and saying a </v>

519
00:22:36.591 --> 00:22:37.790
<v Speaker 1>couple things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

520
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard you incite violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

521
00:22:39.861 --> 00:22:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard you call to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hurt anyone directly.</v>

522
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.810
<v Speaker 1>You're saying things you're even </v>
<v Speaker 1>admitting.</v>

523
00:22:44.811 --> 00:22:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's clear that you're admitting</v>

524
00:22:46.281 --> 00:22:51.080
<v Speaker 1>that you do sometimes go over the line </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you even think is proper.</v>

525
00:22:51.081 --> 00:22:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Sort of to just elicit a response from </v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't true,</v>

526
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.580
<v Speaker 2>but I'll certainly use provocative </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

527
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.451
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

528
00:22:57.451 --> 00:22:58.284
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go up and I'll make black dick </v>

529
00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:02.160
<v Speaker 2>jokes and I'll do all that kind of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

530
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.840
<v Speaker 1>we're still allowed to make jokes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy at that.</v>

531
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

532
00:23:06.951 --> 00:23:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Well you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now for to say that,</v>

533
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.220
<v Speaker 2>but Chris Rock Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these comedians,</v>

534
00:23:11.221 --> 00:23:12.330
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't understand this,</v>

535
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians like gay people that we spoke </v>

536
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:16.140
<v Speaker 2>about this in the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time I was here,</v>

537
00:23:16.141 --> 00:23:17.670
<v Speaker 2>so canaries in the coal mine with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

538
00:23:17.671 --> 00:23:19.950
<v Speaker 2>They understand the threats to create a </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom before everybody else.</v>

539
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.023
<v Speaker 2>And No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make jokes in this country </v>

540
00:23:22.111 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't make this job.</v>

541
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.113
<v Speaker 2>You cannot make innocent jokes in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country anymore without running serious </v>

542
00:23:26.731 --> 00:23:27.564
<v Speaker 2>risk of professional professional damage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and social censure and if you are a </v>

543
00:23:30.391 --> 00:23:31.224
<v Speaker 2>public figure making a joke about </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to do with race or gender or </v>

544
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.900
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you are at risk.</v>

545
00:23:36.901 --> 00:23:39.450
<v Speaker 2>You're at risk from one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these mobs coming off soon.</v>

546
00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.393
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so funny because I'm obviously as </v>

547
00:23:41.691 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 1>big of a free speech proponent as could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly exist and I think sometimes</v>

548
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 3>that I'm tweeting something and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

549
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:49.184
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone looks back on this in 10 </v>

550
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this ideology,</v>

551
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:55.910
<v Speaker 3>if this leftist ideology keeps taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown in jail in 10 years,</v>

552
00:23:55.911 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 3>they're going to go well because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be a law passed and said,</v>

553
00:23:58.071 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago you tweeted that,</v>

554
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:00.254
<v Speaker 3>this and that and but I prefer to take a</v>
<v Speaker 3>more courageous approach to it and you </v>

555
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

556
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.130
<v Speaker 3>the proper response to outreach to our </v>
<v Speaker 3>rich cultures to be outrageous.</v>

557
00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I prefer to double down.</v>

558
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.340
<v Speaker 3>If somebody says that they find </v>
<v Speaker 3>something offensive,</v>

559
00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I will tell a joke twice as bad because </v>
<v Speaker 3>words don't hurt you.</v>

560
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.600
<v Speaker 3>You get a certain leash though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being British and gay,</v>

561
00:24:17.601 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 3>I think it gives you a certain leash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

562
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.600
<v Speaker 3>I like to think it's my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's my,</v>

563
00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 3>my hard work and a and fact based </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

564
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.283
<v Speaker 3>a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but recognize it's probably got more to </v>

565
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:32.110
<v Speaker 3>do with my good looks hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hair.</v>

566
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:32.781
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you.</v>

567
00:24:32.781 --> 00:24:35.810
<v Speaker 3>You do get a certain leash because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your persona.</v>

568
00:24:35.811 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Now you've built that yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't mean that to discredit you in</v>

569
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:41.540
<v Speaker 3>any way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know how hard you misleading word.</v>

570
00:24:41.541 --> 00:24:45.140
<v Speaker 3>I've always been this ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't make you see.</v>

571
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 3>I feel that the regressives made me like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

572
00:24:47.481 --> 00:24:50.130
<v Speaker 3>You feel you were born this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born ridiculous.</v>

573
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.530
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born with it.</v>

574
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:52.364
<v Speaker 3>We're forcing ridiculousness upon you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to make a point to the </v>

575
00:24:54.741 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Speaker 3>crazy people that you have to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live with.</v>

576
00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

577
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Let's back up a little bit because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to talk a little bit more about the</v>

578
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:01.124
<v Speaker 3>social media companies themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've made a good point about </v>

579
00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:05.420
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no doubt that twitter,</v>

580
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 3>we know that their shadow banning right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas people are popular.</v>

581
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:11.660
<v Speaker 3>People who say unpopular things suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't show up in time,</v>

582
00:25:11.661 --> 00:25:12.494
<v Speaker 3>wondered about people wondered about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this for awhile and I was the one that </v>

583
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:15.074
<v Speaker 3>broke the story because I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>confirmation from multiple people that </v>

584
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:21.500
<v Speaker 3>they work with very closely saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter admitted,</v>

585
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we absolutely do do this.</v>

586
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.230
<v Speaker 3>We white list certain accounts so they </v>
<v Speaker 3>show up in the top of search results and</v>

587
00:25:27.231 --> 00:25:30.280
<v Speaker 3>we blacklists some accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they jumped and you know,</v>

588
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.240
<v Speaker 3>this is not in question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>

589
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:34.550
<v Speaker 3>it's not a conspiracy theory of many </v>
<v Speaker 3>things on twitter.</v>

590
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Feel a bit like conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

591
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the band under the Hashtag.</v>

592
00:25:38.091 --> 00:25:41.110
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes they might have done and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they've definitely didn't.</v>

593
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.740
<v Speaker 3>And who now I'm pretty sure they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fiddling around with the regressive left</v>

594
00:25:43.741 --> 00:25:45.380
<v Speaker 3>tash that they offered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

595
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:46.783
<v Speaker 3>there's no question whatsoever because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've admitted to two sources that </v>

596
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:52.000
<v Speaker 3>have come to us that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

597
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.080
<v Speaker 3>we've published as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

598
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.823
<v Speaker 3>they've admitted that they actively </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulate their network in order to </v>

599
00:25:58.821 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 3>favor people they like and often our </v>
<v Speaker 3>business partners,</v>

600
00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:03.590
<v Speaker 3>but it's also people that they're like </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologically.</v>

601
00:26:03.591 --> 00:26:08.591
<v Speaker 3>So that really is 1984 kinds of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>for what we can have in 2016.</v>

602
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.850
<v Speaker 3>This type of manipulating either we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking definitely entitled to do it.</v>

603
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.920
<v Speaker 3>You just need to stop lying about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's perfectly entitled to do.</v>

604
00:26:15.921 --> 00:26:17.120
<v Speaker 3>If they want to run their network like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

605
00:26:17.121 --> 00:26:18.470
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The business will collapse.</v>

606
00:26:18.471 --> 00:26:19.304
<v Speaker 3>The Conservatives are all even and most </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal is actually also want to win on </v>

607
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:22.544
<v Speaker 3>the merits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want.</v>

608
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.180
<v Speaker 3>They don't want the game to be rigged </v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

609
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to think most liberals,</v>

610
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.410
<v Speaker 3>a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decent,</v>

611
00:26:27.411 --> 00:26:29.420
<v Speaker 3>honest people who would like to win on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the merits.</v>

612
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:30.254
<v Speaker 3>I think most don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen much evidence of that in </v>

613
00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:34.040
<v Speaker 3>the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will get hijacked.</v>

614
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I really am a firm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I see what's happening.</v>

615
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Haven't been hijacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see that I have so many friends like</v>

616
00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:43.600
<v Speaker 3>this and you're all idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very clear.</v>

617
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.420
<v Speaker 3>Movement has left you behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no space,</v>

618
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.940
<v Speaker 3>no space for free speech on the left and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just this bit of the left.</v>

619
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.073
<v Speaker 3>Most of the left you are in a tiny slice</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the left of people who still care </v>

620
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:53.850
<v Speaker 3>about reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rigor,</v>

621
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.750
<v Speaker 3>fact scrutiny and free speech and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>is no place for you on the left anymore,</v>

622
00:26:57.751 --> 00:27:00.900
<v Speaker 3>so you need to come over and you need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>just just just given,</v>

623
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.243
<v Speaker 3>given I understand that you were going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do the whole like I'm a liberal who </v>

624
00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 3>believes in free speech thing is good </v>
<v Speaker 3>marketing,</v>

625
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:08.934
<v Speaker 3>but give it up there seriously because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing for you on the left </v>

626
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

627
00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.790
<v Speaker 3>but that's why they don't even like </v>
<v Speaker 3>cute.</v>

628
00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.813
<v Speaker 3>They don't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They decided now that if you're gay but </v>

629
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:22.470
<v Speaker 3>you're white and a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the white man bits of the privileged gay</v>

630
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.080
<v Speaker 3>bits and now they're telling us that </v>
<v Speaker 3>our.</v>

631
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Now they're telling us that our sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferences are racist.</v>

632
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Like if you've gotten your grindr </v>
<v Speaker 3>profile,</v>

633
00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:30.750
<v Speaker 3>I could prefer white guys.</v>

634
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.250
<v Speaker 3>And I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a column on this.</v>

635
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:33.900
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only job I've ever had censored.</v>

636
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.830
<v Speaker 3>My employers are wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so supportive and brilliant.</v>

637
00:27:37.831 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 3>They let me write whatever the hell I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want with it.</v>

638
00:27:39.031 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Speaker 3>This is the one that they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you sure you want to do that?</v>

639
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.250
<v Speaker 3>I sort of what my grindr profile says </v>
<v Speaker 3>blackstone is that racist.</v>

640
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although of course I wouldn't put blacks</v>

641
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:47.250
<v Speaker 3>only because that might put some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

642
00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:49.140
<v Speaker 3>I'll do words that create the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect,</v>

643
00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:49.974
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like don't contact me if you are under </v>

644
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:52.200
<v Speaker 3>seven inches and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your dad is.</v>

645
00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.770
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the energy,</v>

646
00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.450
<v Speaker 3>the energy that they're now policing our</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexuality,</v>

647
00:27:57.451 --> 00:27:58.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

648
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.710
<v Speaker 3>you straight white gay men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

649
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.310
<v Speaker 3>well it's the straight white bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

650
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.300
<v Speaker 3>So that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

651
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.550
<v Speaker 3>the white gay men and difficult to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with it.</v>

652
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.470
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot.</v>

653
00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:08.480
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that.</v>

654
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.240
<v Speaker 3>So that's sort of what I see with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>

655
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.920
<v Speaker 3>I know you're going to work this next </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour you're going to be working,</v>

656
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 3>but when I see the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there's never an end to it.</v>

657
00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:19.164
<v Speaker 3>So they sort of used gays to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little more power and now they're done </v>

658
00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:22.861
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

659
00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:23.694
<v Speaker 3>you've now that you're saying right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that what we discussed in our </v>

660
00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:26.934
<v Speaker 3>last show you were completely wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was completely right to and I said </v>

661
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.193
<v Speaker 3>that you were part of the problem that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you had bought out into this sort of </v>

662
00:28:31.681 --> 00:28:34.320
<v Speaker 3>domestication of homosexuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The liberals just want to plunk you down</v>

663
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:35.640
<v Speaker 3>in gay areas there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do you live?</v>

664
00:28:35.641 --> 00:28:36.474
<v Speaker 3>You lived at Gary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel,</v>

665
00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.360
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course you do a,</v>

666
00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:39.194
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plunk you down with your dog and your </v>

667
00:28:40.231 --> 00:28:41.710
<v Speaker 3>husband and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're nice lighting,</v>

668
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.530
<v Speaker 3>nice domestic life and now they've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

669
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Now they've got you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be a democrat voter forever.</v>

670
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.943
<v Speaker 3>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they can move onto the next group </v>

671
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:48.804
<v Speaker 3>and then just got you in the bag and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole point we talked about last time </v>

672
00:28:50.941 --> 00:28:53.040
<v Speaker 3>about sort of dissident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gay culture,</v>

673
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:54.840
<v Speaker 3>but the most exciting people being the </v>
<v Speaker 3>free thinkers.</v>

674
00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:56.460
<v Speaker 3>I think you're now starting to realize I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was right,</v>

675
00:28:56.461 --> 00:28:57.660
<v Speaker 3>which is lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very gratifying for me.</v>

676
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

677
00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.230
<v Speaker 3>I realized that the left leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was six months ahead.</v>

678
00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll look.</v>

679
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:03.714
<v Speaker 3>I realized without question that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left has lost its mind as to the point </v>

680
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:07.824
<v Speaker 3>that it's a slice like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that the fight that my side </v>

681
00:29:11.431 --> 00:29:14.640
<v Speaker 3>of this on the left is starting to wake </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in big numbers,</v>

682
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:15.623
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think we all have to somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>defect to you guys just yet as much as </v>

683
00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:20.430
<v Speaker 3>you'd like to you guys.</v>

684
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:21.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a Republican.</v>

685
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:22.494
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

686
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.500
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm British for stock.</v>

687
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Might even vote here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a daddy supporter,</v>

688
00:29:26.941 --> 00:29:27.774
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get to your daddy called </v>

689
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 3>trump daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows this now.</v>

690
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:32.503
<v Speaker 3>I'm so just wrapping up the social media</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and free speech related to these </v>

691
00:29:36.331 --> 00:29:37.164
<v Speaker 3>companies.</v>

00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 3>social justice warriors and it really </v>
<v Speaker 3>does seem like,</v>

693
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.333

<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>

696

<v Speaker 3>don't want to be banned on facebook and </v>

697
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:51.161
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

698
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:51.994
<v Speaker 3>we put our videos up on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously I saw last week or two weeks </v>

699
00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:56.104
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was this organization that does </v>

700
00:29:57.581 --> 00:30:00.730
<v Speaker 3>translations from Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

701
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:01.564
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all they do is translate what moms are </v>

702
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:07.140
<v Speaker 3>saying and mosques or telling about </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing all the Jews and killing all the</v>

703
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.880
<v Speaker 3>gates and they got banned for hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>

704
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.713
<v Speaker 3>All they do is translate the hate speech</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough want you should know what the </v>

705
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:15.004
<v Speaker 3>Muslims are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want you to know what's </v>

706
00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 3>happening in these mos because if people</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew about it,</v>

707
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:19.810
<v Speaker 3>they might be less happy with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

708
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:20.644
<v Speaker 3>this huge influx of immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might be less happy about having </v>

709
00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:24.970
<v Speaker 3>their own perfectly reasonable points of</v>
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>

710
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Censored and mischaracterized as hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>

711
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:29.254
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what the left does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It mischaracterizes ridicule and </v>

712
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:32.854
<v Speaker 3>criticism is abuse and harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can mischaracterize is perfectly </v>

713
00:30:35.111 --> 00:30:35.944
<v Speaker 3>valid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinary anxieties that regular people </v>

714
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.373
<v Speaker 3>are justified in having as hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at on the world now and I'm </v>

715
00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:45.730
<v Speaker 3>thinking people like Tommy Robinson from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the edl,</v>

716
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:46.763
<v Speaker 3>he's been on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian and I'm thinking there was some </v>

717
00:30:49.331 --> 00:30:50.950
<v Speaker 3>things he said in the nineties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

718
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.730
<v Speaker 3>It was fun too much and the violence is </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously obviously unacceptable,</v>

719
00:30:54.731 --> 00:30:56.720
<v Speaker 3>but I'm listening to him now and people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

720
00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Tommy Robinson has racist pig.</v>

721
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna say now I can't find </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything to disagree with.</v>

722
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.103
<v Speaker 3>I can't find anything to disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in his speech when he went to Oxford </v>

723
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.460
<v Speaker 3>University,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mapped out his,</v>

724
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.323
<v Speaker 3>his life and what he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he saw his community changing and </v>

725
00:31:08.921 --> 00:31:10.370
<v Speaker 3>how he saw the police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

726
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 3>either hamstrung or actively lying about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

727
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:14.090
<v Speaker 3>The government lying about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the media lying about it.</v>

728
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.240
<v Speaker 3>And all this stuff is now playing out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>social media.</v>

729
00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:19.420
<v Speaker 3>And the scary thing about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies is that they are totally,</v>

730
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:23.200
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are in lockstep with government,</v>

731
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 3>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany,</v>

732
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.800
<v Speaker 3>lockstep with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

733
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:27.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Merkel,</v>

734
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.830
<v Speaker 3>there video of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Zuckerberg,</v>

735
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Mark Zuckerberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

736
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.640
<v Speaker 3>twitter here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>locks.</v>

737
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.960
<v Speaker 3>They have meetings all day everyday with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

738
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:37.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

739
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with government officials at lockstep on</v>

740
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:41.160
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

741
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

742
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.200
<v Speaker 3>when daddy gets into the White House,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

743
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

744
00:31:45.701 --> 00:31:46.270
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible.</v>

745
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:47.380
<v Speaker 3>I should tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say data,</v>

746
00:31:47.381 --> 00:31:48.214
<v Speaker 3>you're talking trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just for the people that don't know all </v>

747
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.233
<v Speaker 3>your lingo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone just yet they're referring to </v>

748
00:31:51.581 --> 00:31:52.414
<v Speaker 3>trump will get to for I'm referring to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the God emperor trump it as the God </v>

749
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:56.790
<v Speaker 3>emperor and his incoming trump and </v>
<v Speaker 3>riker.</v>

750
00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:00.160
<v Speaker 3>So I've realized if I accomplish nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>else with you while sitting here,</v>

751
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.233
<v Speaker 3>I want you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've accomplished nothing so nothing </v>

752
00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:04.114
<v Speaker 3>happens over night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want you to at least make the </v>

753
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.493
<v Speaker 3>different distinction between when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about the left and leftists versus </v>

754
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:12.530
<v Speaker 3>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

755
00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.250
<v Speaker 3>really don't see those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to make that distinction.</v>

756
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:17.860
<v Speaker 3>So you just think I'm just the outlier </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this situation.</v>

757
00:32:17.861 --> 00:32:19.310
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

758
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.140
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm the outlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he does $50,</v>

759
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:22.460
<v Speaker 3>million viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I will,</v>

760
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.010
<v Speaker 3>whatever the hell numbers they have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheel.</v>

761
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.570
<v Speaker 3>If someone's people didn't come from </v>
<v Speaker 3>nowhere,</v>

762
00:32:25.571 --> 00:32:26.404
<v Speaker 3>that's what the left is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't belong there and I </v>

763
00:32:29.831 --> 00:32:30.960
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't call those people liberal.</v>

764
00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 3>It's more of a work of linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>history that the American left,</v>

765
00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.053
<v Speaker 3>his called is called the liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement because they don't believe in </v>

766
00:32:38.111 --> 00:32:39.040
<v Speaker 3>liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The not classical,</v>

767
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.520
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

768
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:41.354
<v Speaker 3>arguing over words like the left likes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do isn't going to change the fact </v>

769
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 3>that the entire left side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>American political spectrum has gone mad</v>

770
00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 3>and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

771
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 3>you just can't in good conscience vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrat and if you've,</v>

772
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:54.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't believe in any of this </v>

773
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:56.534
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want us to be able to have </v>

774
00:32:57.531 --> 00:33:00.200
<v Speaker 3>discussions like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just on your show,</v>

775
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 3>but on the national news and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pages of the newspapers,</v>

776
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:04.640
<v Speaker 3>if you believe in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot vote Democrat.</v>

777
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:07.040
<v Speaker 3>Well that's where these motherfuckers </v>
<v Speaker 3>have caught me.</v>

778
00:33:07.041 --> 00:33:10.280
<v Speaker 3>They've really pushed me into a corner </v>
<v Speaker 3>here because everything,</v>

779
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.050
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the free speech stuff,</v>

780
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

781
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting against the ideology,</v>

782
00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:15.800
<v Speaker 3>secularism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that stuff.</v>

783
00:33:15.801 --> 00:33:17.480
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my stuff.</v>

784
00:33:17.481 --> 00:33:20.750
<v Speaker 3>That's the stuff I really care about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crazy on the left.</v>

785
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.360
<v Speaker 3>So the left right now is crazy on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff I care about most.</v>

786
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 3>And I say that as someone that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>

787
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.630
<v Speaker 3>not voted democratic ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here we are so that now,</v>

788
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.470
<v Speaker 3>as I've scared you is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the Segue,</v>

789
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.740
<v Speaker 3>the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a table where.</v>

790
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

791
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.080
<v Speaker 3>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's move on to trump.</v>

792
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.240
<v Speaker 3>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were here in October,</v>

793
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 3>I think you were just starting to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind the trump movement,</v>

794
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:43.274
<v Speaker 3>but at that time was at that time I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't sure at that time he had had </v>

795
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.943
<v Speaker 3>maybe had one or two debates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was still saying this was a </v>

796
00:33:51.561 --> 00:33:52.394
<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was still saying it was a </v>

797
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:55.250
<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's clearly not a joke.</v>

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 3>And what does it was that great </v>

00:34:12.471 --> 00:34:12.921
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

807
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:14.540
<v Speaker 3>do I really want trump in the White </v>
<v Speaker 3>House on North shore?</v>

808
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:15.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure about that,</v>

809
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.380
<v Speaker 3>but I'm enjoying the spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My views have evolved.</v>

810
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.380
<v Speaker 3>The evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

811
00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:22.214
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I care about all the things that you </v>

812
00:34:23.151 --> 00:34:23.984
<v Speaker 3>care about and I see the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplish what we collectively want to </v>

813
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.760
<v Speaker 3>throw our lot in with,</v>

814
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.120
<v Speaker 2>with the politician that doesn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the rest of them,</v>

815
00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:36.860
<v Speaker 2>that it terrifies the rest of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

816
00:34:36.861 --> 00:34:37.694
<v Speaker 2>the prospect of a trump candidacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prospect of a trump presidency </v>

817
00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:43.700
<v Speaker 2>terrifies not just liberals or </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives to,</v>

818
00:34:43.701 --> 00:34:47.480
<v Speaker 2>because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he threatens to blow apart the political</v>

819
00:34:47.481 --> 00:34:49.150
<v Speaker 2>consensus to blow apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

820
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.500
<v Speaker 2>fiscal crisis in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe as I do,</v>

821
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:53.630
<v Speaker 2>that is one of the great cancers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>public life.</v>

822
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.070
<v Speaker 2>There's nobody better situated to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun with that than trump.</v>

823
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:00.100
<v Speaker 2>If you believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

824
00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just the left but the right has lost</v>

825
00:35:01.911 --> 00:35:03.620
<v Speaker 2>it's way too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you believe that,</v>

826
00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.580
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do one of these at a time.</v>

827
00:35:05.581 --> 00:35:08.070
<v Speaker 3>So if you believe that you want to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>blow the system apart,</v>

828
00:35:08.071 --> 00:35:09.190
<v Speaker 3>you're the first thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentioned.</v>

829
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm an engine of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're all.</v>

830
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Am I allowed to say you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say whatever.</v>

831
00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.673
<v Speaker 3>You know what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're like the joker in Batman in </v>

832
00:35:17.101 --> 00:35:17.760
<v Speaker 3>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

833
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.960
<v Speaker 3>He just wanted to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I stopped.</v>

834
00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.540
<v Speaker 3>That counts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you want to burn.</v>

835
00:35:24.541 --> 00:35:26.400
<v Speaker 3>So basically you would want to burn the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

836
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.633
<v Speaker 3>See</v>

837
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Gop politicians telling CNN reports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was CNN,</v>

838
00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:33.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public doesn't pick the candidate.</v>

839
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Will we pick the candidate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think to myself,</v>

840
00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:40.680
<v Speaker 2>you deserve to know these people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the public.</v>

841
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.693
<v Speaker 2>They don't like their own electorates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Republican Party has become as </v>

842
00:35:44.701 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 2>hostile to its own base as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as liberals have always been.</v>

843
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.033
<v Speaker 2>They started talking about their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>base in the same way that liberals </v>

844
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:53.070
<v Speaker 2>always have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

845
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:53.963
<v Speaker 2>you've got National Review publishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting things about why white </v>

846
00:35:56.581 --> 00:35:59.850
<v Speaker 2>working class Americans just awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people aren't going away.</v>

847
00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:00.813
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these people are angry and </v>

848
00:36:01.471 --> 00:36:03.720
<v Speaker 2>frustrated and it was interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

849
00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I think has captured the imagination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge swathe of the population,</v>

850
00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.653
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what you might call traditional </v>

851
00:36:10.471 --> 00:36:11.700
<v Speaker 2>trump supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

852
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the veterans,</v>

853
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white working classes who feel very </v>

854
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.223
<v Speaker 2>disoriented by this new globalized world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and very concerned about mass </v>

855
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>immigration for wage reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for cultural reasons too,</v>

856
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.190
<v Speaker 2>and they're right to be considered.</v>

857
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.023
<v Speaker 2>Those are just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

858
00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 2>both of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of those accounts but,</v>

859
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 2>and the question I always get asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean to disrespect that,</v>

860
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.840
<v Speaker 2>that group at all because that group is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

861
00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:35.540
<v Speaker 2>is my readership and I love them when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people ask me what is smart people about</v>

862
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.211
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they mean is,</v>

863
00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:37.580
<v Speaker 2>what if people like us for trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

864
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.240
<v Speaker 2>we're not because we're not supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

865
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.101
<v Speaker 2>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not you.</v>

866
00:36:40.101 --> 00:36:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously not you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why do people like me vote?</v>

867
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Why would I vote trump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you know media types?</v>

868
00:36:46.081 --> 00:36:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Fuck trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

869
00:36:47.531 --> 00:36:48.364
<v Speaker 2>the answer to that is he represents the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best hope we have of smashing political </v>

870
00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 2>correctness apart of breaking open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

871
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:57.443
<v Speaker 2>all of the taboos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things stuff you're not supposed to </v>

872
00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and allowing real debate to be had.</v>

873
00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:02.064
<v Speaker 2>Again today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is impossible in America to have an </v>

874
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:05.843
<v Speaker 2>honest discussion about the wage gap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about whether or not men and women get </v>

875
00:37:08.971 --> 00:37:11.700
<v Speaker 2>paid different amounts of money and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't get into that today,</v>

876
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.320
<v Speaker 2>but what we can't use radical Islam as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>more relevant example.</v>

877
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.153
<v Speaker 2>You can't have an honest discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would lose your job or you wouldn't </v>

878
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:21.000
<v Speaker 2>get it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll never get a comment.</v>

879
00:37:21.001 --> 00:37:21.834
<v Speaker 2>National newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overton window is so narrow and </v>

880
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:25.970
<v Speaker 2>pushed so far to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

881
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:30.720
<v Speaker 2>that something big has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A big tumultuous event needs to happen.</v>

882
00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:31.554
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that that event is a trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>presidency because I think it will </v>

883
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:35.820
<v Speaker 2>destroy the Republican Party that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>never win another election,</v>

884
00:37:35.821 --> 00:37:36.654
<v Speaker 2>which is what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the same thing will happen </v>

885
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:39.040
<v Speaker 2>on the left too with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

886
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.880
<v Speaker 2>the Sanders Hilary kind of tearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>comment on the left.</v>

887
00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I have what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

888
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:47.490
<v Speaker 2>and I think this might be what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I want is a source of new political</v>

889
00:37:47.491 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 2>realignment on Libertarian authoritarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines rather than left and right.</v>

890
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.060
<v Speaker 2>And I want a new consensus to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A disaffected liberals,</v>

891
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.140
<v Speaker 2>classical liberals.</v>

892
00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dissident minorities like gays,</v>

893
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a small state conservatives,</v>

894
00:38:01.081 --> 00:38:01.914
<v Speaker 2>libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who basically want to be left </v>

895
00:38:03.391 --> 00:38:04.224
<v Speaker 2>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who believe that government </v>

896
00:38:05.491 --> 00:38:09.050
<v Speaker 2>should have some limited functions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our culture should not be policed on</v>

897
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:09.900
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not be police.</v>

898
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.910
<v Speaker 2>We should be able to do be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

899
00:38:11.911 --> 00:38:14.520
<v Speaker 2>think and act exactly as we pleased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

900
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:15.354
<v Speaker 2>I believe there is a majority in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country who would get behind that sort </v>

901
00:38:18.631 --> 00:38:19.464
<v Speaker 2>of cultural insurgency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this election is the first election </v>

902
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:27.150
<v Speaker 2>in American history that has been fought</v>
<v Speaker 2>not on foreign policy and on economics.</v>

903
00:38:27.151 --> 00:38:30.510
<v Speaker 2>It's being fought culturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been edited and it is being a,</v>

904
00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:31.344
<v Speaker 2>it has been excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has been stirred up by a cultural </v>

905
00:38:34.201 --> 00:38:36.390
<v Speaker 2>figure by reality TV star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a,</v>

906
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an American icon.</v>

907
00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:39.403
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've come around to believe that </v>

908
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:42.904
<v Speaker 2>actually having trump in the White House</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be wonderful and if he finds </v>

909
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:47.944
<v Speaker 2>himself in the White House and isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to achieve very much inside of me </v>

910
00:38:49.931 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 2>is going to daddy's gonna build a wall </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is going to fix trade.</v>

911
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:53.583
<v Speaker 2>And that's gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If then things start locking up because </v>

912
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:58.380
<v Speaker 2>he's got a noncompliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

913
00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.180
<v Speaker 2>left and right in all the various </v>
<v Speaker 2>machinery of government.</v>

914
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that as a particularly bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

915
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.470
<v Speaker 2>One of the best presidents in history </v>
<v Speaker 2>was coolidge.</v>

916
00:39:05.471 --> 00:39:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he did absolutely nothing.</v>

917
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.393
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:09.723
<v Speaker 2>having some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having like a cooler with bluster would </v>

919
00:39:10.991 --> 00:39:11.824
<v Speaker 2>be no bad thing and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticisms that are normally leveled at </v>

920
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:15.184
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the stuff that people say </v>

921
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:18.700
<v Speaker 2>clownish and his populous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see those things.</v>

922
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as intrinsically I'm anti presidential.</v>

923
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

924
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 2>presidential material is very much in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the eye and the eye of the beholder.</v>

925
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:28.270
<v Speaker 2>And clearly there are enough Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>who do believe,</v>

926
00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:29.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

927
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.753
<v Speaker 2>that trump is presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really exciting about trump is </v>

928
00:39:33.491 --> 00:39:36.520
<v Speaker 2>that he is to the same in the same way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are,</v>

929
00:39:36.521 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I definitely am.</v>

930
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm trump is a direct creation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive left.</v>

931
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.173
<v Speaker 2>He has been brought about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He exists because of the people that we </v>

932
00:39:46.271 --> 00:39:47.090
<v Speaker 2>both hate.</v>

933
00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:50.280
<v Speaker 1>So I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There had been saying for a long time,</v>

934
00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.480
<v Speaker 2>bullied and policed and and harangued </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hectored,</v>

935
00:39:54.481 --> 00:39:55.314
<v Speaker 2>a name called for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've told people that they are </v>

936
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:01.020
<v Speaker 2>homophobes when they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're topical,</v>

937
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.680
<v Speaker 2>they're sexist when they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're topical,</v>

938
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.010
<v Speaker 2>they're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they're not there.</v>

939
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Tell people they're transphobic and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even know what that means.</v>

940
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be bringing out all the heavy,</v>

941
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.340
<v Speaker 1>heavy weapons here to bring the over </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I get this.</v>

942
00:40:11.341 --> 00:40:15.930
<v Speaker 1>You're going to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what I'd want to use the</v>

943
00:40:15.931 --> 00:40:17.940
<v Speaker 1>left because I didn't want this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

944
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too late now,</v>

945
00:40:19.141 --> 00:40:19.974
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you either get on the train or you </v>

946
00:40:23.701 --> 00:40:24.690
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares.</v>

947
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you not see some risk.</v>

948
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.823
<v Speaker 1>Even if I grant you all of that and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say a lot of them questioning in order </v>

949
00:40:31.981 --> 00:40:35.280
<v Speaker 1>to seem to have seem to have grown too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I grant you all of that,</v>

950
00:40:35.281 --> 00:40:36.114
<v Speaker 1>do you think that there is some risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>that by unearthing all of the ways we </v>

951
00:40:41.941 --> 00:40:43.350
<v Speaker 1>speak to each other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

952
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I say this as the most pro free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>person there is.</v>

953
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I am definitely now seeing a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>current of racism rising up,</v>

954
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.253
<v Speaker 1>a real current of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of really hating Muslims of really </v>

955
00:40:55.111 --> 00:40:56.800
<v Speaker 1>hating Jews have really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

956
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:57.703
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing it bubble up on social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're misreading the </v>

957
00:40:59.401 --> 00:41:00.210
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

958
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:01.930
<v Speaker 1>So how am I misreading that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

959
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

960
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.260
<v Speaker 2>are we not worried about this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubbling up isn't bubble.</v>

961
00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.430
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's always been.</v>

962
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>It's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

963
00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:10.490
<v Speaker 2>people have prejudices about people </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes there's prejudices.</v>

964
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.760
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

965
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.910
<v Speaker 2>when I was speaking at rutgers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody in one of the,</v>

966
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:15.850
<v Speaker 2>one of the students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

967
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:16.421
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

968
00:41:16.421 --> 00:41:19.600
<v Speaker 2>there are studies that show that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that white people think black people are</v>

969
00:41:19.601 --> 00:41:21.310
<v Speaker 2>loud and obnoxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

970
00:41:21.311 --> 00:41:24.130
<v Speaker 2>and that's racist and maybe that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural thing.</v>

971
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:25.003
<v Speaker 2>Black people do use language differently</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just couldn't wrap their head </v>

972
00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:27.364
<v Speaker 2>around the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that a prejudice might be right now </v>

973
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:31.300
<v Speaker 2>it's what you do with that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>assumption or prejudice or whatever.</v>

974
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

975
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.550
<v Speaker 2>the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

976
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:39.000
<v Speaker 2>It may be that the two things to say on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this right,</v>

977
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.003
<v Speaker 2>one is just no hatefulness and racism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sexism and homophobia left in this </v>

978
00:41:45.201 --> 00:41:45.530
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

979
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:46.363
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the expression of that kind of </v>

980
00:41:47.931 --> 00:41:51.080
<v Speaker 2>stuff is driven by the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

981
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.480
<v Speaker 2>when it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of,</v>

982
00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

983
00:41:54.591 --> 00:41:55.330
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

984
00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:57.800
<v Speaker 2>they go looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for homophobia.</v>

985
00:41:57.801 --> 00:41:59.170
<v Speaker 2>They call around all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

986
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:03.230
<v Speaker 2>bakeries in the Midwest or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally they find somebody who says,</v>

987
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:04.470
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd rather not do a lesbian wedding.</v>

988
00:42:04.471 --> 00:42:05.031
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

989
00:42:05.031 --> 00:42:06.830
<v Speaker 2>we found some homophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>

990
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go all in on it.</v>

991
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:10.123
<v Speaker 2>It makes me want to go out and bash </v>
<v Speaker 2>queers when I say I'm so angry about it </v>

992
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:17.420
<v Speaker 2>because it's just such obvious bollocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the second thing,</v>

993
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:18.110
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

994
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.300
<v Speaker 2>when you police down like crushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

995
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.253
<v Speaker 2>it creates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it creates exactly what you're claiming </v>

996
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:23.414
<v Speaker 2>that you are looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is sort of kafkaesque for </v>

997
00:42:25.261 --> 00:42:26.580
<v Speaker 2>bactrian cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left and the second thing,</v>

998
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.750
<v Speaker 2>we're also using it specifically to </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack Christians in this case,</v>

999
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1000
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.003
<v Speaker 2>Because you wouldn't go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see them going is the article </v>

1001
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.650
<v Speaker 2>that are interested in the bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't care about fixing bigotry.</v>

1002
00:42:36.651 --> 00:42:39.020
<v Speaker 2>They care about hurting Christians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculing Christians.</v>

1003
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.093
<v Speaker 2>That's all true to second thing is your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say you're seeing all this stuff </v>

1004
00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:44.200
<v Speaker 2>bubble up on social media at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1005
00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:44.841
<v Speaker 2>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me take the.</v>

1006
00:42:44.841 --> 00:42:47.870
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What remains the big taboo in society,</v>

1007
00:42:47.871 --> 00:42:49.190
<v Speaker 2>which is Anti Semitism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1008
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Most of the generation trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outright people,</v>

1009
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.840
<v Speaker 2>so people who like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not antisemites.</v>

1010
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.710
<v Speaker 2>They don't care about Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They May.</v>

1011
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.390
<v Speaker 2>They may have some assumptions about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews.</v>

1012
00:42:59.391 --> 00:43:02.330
<v Speaker 2>They may have some prejudice about Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Jews run everything while we do</v>

1013
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:04.220
<v Speaker 2>the Jews run all the banks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we do,</v>

1014
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 2>the Jews run the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we do,</v>

1015
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:07.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're right about all that </v>

1016
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:08.504
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what you do with that is is the </v>

1017
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:10.820
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason they go on a parody,</v>

1018
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.620
<v Speaker 2>but where to start with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just go.</v>

1019
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.070
<v Speaker 2>This is not intubate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's statistical facts.</v>

1020
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Now the Jews are on most of the banks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews,</v>

1021
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Jews completely dominate the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vastly disproportionately represented in</v>

1022
00:43:20.901 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 2>all of these professions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a fact,</v>

1023
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:25.730
<v Speaker 2>isn't antisense antisemitic to point out</v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics.</v>

1024
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1025
00:43:27.401 --> 00:43:28.460
<v Speaker 2>you seem to have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1026
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:29.920
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've missed what,</v>

1027
00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.980
<v Speaker 2>what you agree with me on feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's not sexist when statistics I'm</v>

1028
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:34.870
<v Speaker 2>suggesting to you is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1029
00:43:34.871 --> 00:43:37.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not antisemitic to point out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things are true.</v>

1030
00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Now the antisemitism on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really important,</v>

1031
00:43:39.781 --> 00:43:41.810
<v Speaker 2>and I want people to understand this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody seems to,</v>

1032
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.780
<v Speaker 2>when Jonah Goldberg of now have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>national review,</v>

1033
00:43:44.781 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever is bombarded by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1034
00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:48.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these memes,</v>

1035
00:43:48.751 --> 00:43:49.461
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1036
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:52.160
<v Speaker 2>that whatever it is and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitic,</v>

1037
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.930
<v Speaker 2>take a hike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this kind of stuff.</v>

1038
00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:54.913
<v Speaker 2>It's not because there is a gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>outpouring of spontaneous outpouring of </v>

1039
00:43:57.891 --> 00:43:59.960
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism from 22 year olds in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1040
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.650
<v Speaker 2>And what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>

1041
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.953
<v Speaker 2>it's a mischievous dissident trolling </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation who do it because it gets a </v>

1042
00:44:08.691 --> 00:44:10.070
<v Speaker 2>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1043
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.920
<v Speaker 2>That's been the case for young people </v>
<v Speaker 2>for generations.</v>

1044
00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:13.754
<v Speaker 2>It's just that now they have access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that really get under people's </v>

1045
00:44:15.501 --> 00:44:17.870
<v Speaker 2>skin and Internet scale economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1046
00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.401
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1047
00:44:18.401 --> 00:44:19.234
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1048
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>viral dynamics and they can get to </v>

1049
00:44:22.491 --> 00:44:26.300
<v Speaker 2>people in positions of power and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in positions of power keep biting and it</v>

1050
00:44:26.301 --> 00:44:28.000
<v Speaker 2>keeps taking the bait that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1051
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.540
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you enjoyed that,</v>

1052
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:30.603
<v Speaker 2>that sort of explain why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I said at the beginning of </v>

1053
00:44:31.591 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 2>the show that you're</v>

1054
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 3>sort of a micro trump to me because your</v>
<v Speaker 3>rise has been.</v>

1055
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I know you want to think you're bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>than trump,</v>

1056
00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 3>but you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1057
00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:38.950
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1058
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:39.783
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1059
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:41.603
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody has everybody's daddy to </v>

1060
00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:44.014
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very happy to trump to be a better </v>

1061
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 3>daddy and I'll be daddy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1062
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:47.981
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1063
00:44:47.981 --> 00:44:51.420
<v Speaker 3>But basically what you're saying is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're using,</v>

1064
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:52.254
<v Speaker 3>they're just using the tools to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>people angry and then it causes another </v>

1065
00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:56.064
<v Speaker 3>reaction and then there's another </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction and that is what it's trolling </v>

1066
00:45:00.301 --> 00:45:03.000
<v Speaker 3>and this is a direct response to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

1067
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 3>Policing is a direct response to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>being told they can't say things.</v>

1068
00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:09.150
<v Speaker 3>What you've got to know about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>millennial generation and,</v>

1069
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:10.950
<v Speaker 3>and my friends run as young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1070
00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Must have 13 year olds,</v>

1071
00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:13.014
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people don't know what the </v>

1072
00:45:14.161 --> 00:45:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Holocaust was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know.</v>

1073
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:18.630
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any living relatives who</v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

1074
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:19.483
<v Speaker 3>who were in it.</v>

1075
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.320
<v Speaker 3>They in many cases don't even really </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember nine slash 11,</v>

1076
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they haven't lived through these big </v>

1077
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 3>traumatic events in world history that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just trolling and I've recognized that,</v>

1078
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:30.504
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying stuff about Jews gets on the </v>

1079
00:45:31.351 --> 00:45:33.120
<v Speaker 3>nerves of journalists and you can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1080
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:34.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like I've seen that guy on Fox </v>
<v Speaker 3>News,</v>

1081
00:45:34.941 --> 00:45:37.750
<v Speaker 3>he's on the TV and I just tweeted him </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this stupid you me,</v>

1082
00:45:37.751 --> 00:45:42.751
<v Speaker 3>but look at it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun.</v>

1083
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.333
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it funny because once you </v>

1084
00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:48.660
<v Speaker 3>recognize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not really about the Jew thing.</v>

1085
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.550
<v Speaker 3>It's about trolling and provocation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that they've identified</v>

1086
00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 3>works really well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You begin to,</v>

1087
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.750
<v Speaker 3>you when you look at it as sauce to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>more sense,</v>

1088
00:45:57.751 --> 00:45:58.501
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1089
00:45:58.501 --> 00:45:59.670
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Racism in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there is no KKK.</v>

1091
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:03.383
<v Speaker 3>What is it like a few thousand members </v>
<v Speaker 3>left that we're constantly told what </v>

1092
00:46:05.431 --> 00:46:06.510
<v Speaker 3>supremacy is a problem.</v>

1093
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 3>There are no white supremacists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no white nationalist.</v>

1094
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:09.571
<v Speaker 3>They don't in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

1095
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 3>in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're nowhere,</v>

1096
00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:11.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1097
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.280
<v Speaker 3>that have no purchase whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no influence,</v>

1098
00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:15.170
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there is,</v>

1099
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.920
<v Speaker 3>if there is a racially supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>

1100
00:46:16.921 --> 00:46:19.770
<v Speaker 3>it's black lives matter and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well funded and it's massive and it gets</v>

1101
00:46:19.771 --> 00:46:20.604
<v Speaker 3>fawning coverage from the media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no white supremacists movement </v>

1102
00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:23.784
<v Speaker 3>in this country and what trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters primarily are reacting to is </v>

1103
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.860
<v Speaker 3>being lied to and lied about for decades</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the establishment.</v>

1104
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.830
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump has a very necessary correction to</v>

1105
00:46:34.831 --> 00:46:35.664
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is part of the Cultural Libertarian </v>

1106
00:46:37.111 --> 00:46:39.630
<v Speaker 3>movement that you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1107
00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I think both would identify with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say he is the,</v>

1108
00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:43.284
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is the ultimate icon of that </v>

1109
00:46:45.061 --> 00:46:45.894
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically you think that nobody else </v>

1110
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:49.620
<v Speaker 3>could do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm with you on a lot of this because</v>

1111
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:50.454
<v Speaker 3>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do meet in that cultural libertarian </v>

1112
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.530
<v Speaker 3>space and I get the language stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1113
00:46:54.531 --> 00:46:57.540
<v Speaker 3>and I get what you're saying about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>antisemitism and all,</v>

1114
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:58.350
<v Speaker 3>all of that stuff.</v>

1115
00:46:58.350 --> 00:46:59.610
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>

1116
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:01.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I never attack people I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1117
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:02.603
<v Speaker 3>I try not to fight with these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're attacking me on twitter or </v>

1118
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:05.423
<v Speaker 3>whatever they just want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care about the subject </v>

1119
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:10.170
<v Speaker 3>because that because it's a 10 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>

1120
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.063
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the left uses this 17 year old cat </v>

1121
00:47:12.571 --> 00:47:16.130
<v Speaker 3>is rolling on the evidence that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>some uprising of antisemitism,</v>

1122
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.540
<v Speaker 3>of a nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1123
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 3>the left doesn't do with antisemitism </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were okay with that.</v>

1124
00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.093
<v Speaker 3>They're fine with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they'll do it with everything else </v>

1125
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.033
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They certainly do it with anti feminism </v>

1126
00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:26.460
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They suggest that there is this epidemic</v>

1127
00:47:26.461 --> 00:47:27.294
<v Speaker 3>of misogyny and they just find a random </v>
<v Speaker 3>tweet that's find all these tweets from </v>

1128
00:47:30.521 --> 00:47:30.930
<v Speaker 3>young</v>

1129
00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:31.980
<v Speaker 2>boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1130
00:47:31.981 --> 00:47:32.814
<v Speaker 2>as to the young girls are congratulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and applauded and encouraged to be </v>

1131
00:47:36.151 --> 00:47:38.580
<v Speaker 2>hateful toward men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right when they,</v>

1132
00:47:38.581 --> 00:47:39.414
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can get involved in kill all white </v>

1133
00:47:40.451 --> 00:47:41.281
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hashtags,</v>

1134
00:47:41.281 --> 00:47:42.690
<v Speaker 2>masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fragile.</v>

1135
00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:43.973
<v Speaker 2>I bathe in male tears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see teenage girls doing this stuff </v>

1136
00:47:46.381 --> 00:47:47.214
<v Speaker 2>and it's hateful and horrible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be alone and miserable </v>

1137
00:47:48.601 --> 00:47:50.430
<v Speaker 2>forever because feminists have ruined </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1138
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1139
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.850
<v Speaker 2>when men do anything remotely similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1140
00:47:53.851 --> 00:47:55.500
<v Speaker 2>they will come in for the most appalling</v>
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>

1141
00:47:55.501 --> 00:47:57.960
<v Speaker 2>They get suspended from school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why girls,</v>

1142
00:47:57.961 --> 00:48:00.050
<v Speaker 2>we under their own names very often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because they,</v>

1143
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.370
<v Speaker 2>many of them are being trained into </v>
<v Speaker 2>being cry bullies.</v>

1144
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.870
<v Speaker 2>They're being trained into being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1145
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:04.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1146
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.330
<v Speaker 2>into putting provocations out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then squealing,</v>

1147
00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:07.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>victimhood had been treated,</v>

1148
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.813
<v Speaker 2>the girls are been taught that victim </v>
<v Speaker 2>button grievance culture is the way to </v>

1149
00:48:10.411 --> 00:48:11.580
<v Speaker 2>get what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have no talent,</v>

1150
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:13.710
<v Speaker 2>they're being trained in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1151
00:48:13.711 --> 00:48:14.544
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1152
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:16.140
<v Speaker 2>into all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boys on the other hand,</v>

1153
00:48:16.141 --> 00:48:16.974
<v Speaker 2>very often are anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like poll on that and like all of </v>

1154
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.930
<v Speaker 2>these places where they can go let off </v>
<v Speaker 2>steam and get,</v>

1155
00:48:21.931 --> 00:48:24.780
<v Speaker 2>get all that boyishness boisterousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of their systems,</v>

1156
00:48:24.781 --> 00:48:26.220
<v Speaker 2>which is a perfectly normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy friends.</v>

1157
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:27.343
<v Speaker 1>This is where they would also play video</v>
<v Speaker 1>games and get some of that aggression </v>

1158
00:48:29.121 --> 00:48:29.500
<v Speaker 1>out</v>

1159
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.950
<v Speaker 3>and not a faggot and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1160
00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:35.530
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine what career I could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>made of,</v>

1161
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:37.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being offended by the word Faggot,</v>

1162
00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1163
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a column saying I want Faggot,</v>

1164
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:41.343
<v Speaker 3>gay and queer to be in common usage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you take the power away from </v>

1165
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:45.730
<v Speaker 3>these words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you believe they have power,</v>

1166
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:47.960
<v Speaker 3>banning them when elevating them up </v>
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>

1167
00:48:47.961 --> 00:48:48.731
<v Speaker 3>into these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1168
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:49.750
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these taboos.</v>

1169
00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:50.820
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote this column,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1170
00:48:50.821 --> 00:48:53.000
<v Speaker 3>but I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want gay to be restored to its real,</v>

1171
00:48:53.001 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 3>like twits prestige.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meaning it doesn't mean you know,</v>

1172
00:48:55.091 --> 00:48:57.430
<v Speaker 3>the real meaning of gays like crap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rubbish,</v>

1173
00:48:57.431 --> 00:48:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lame.</v>

1174
00:48:58.301 --> 00:49:03.301
<v Speaker 3>Hillary supporting immigrant mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1175
00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.633
<v Speaker 3>It's not in the dictionary yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure they're getting around to </v>

1176
00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:06.400
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1177
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.560
<v Speaker 3>this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what gay to me,</v>

1178
00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.453
<v Speaker 3>when somebody says something stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to be able to say as gay or </v>

1179
00:49:11.111 --> 00:49:13.420
<v Speaker 3>stop being a faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean anything.</v>

1180
00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.960
<v Speaker 3>These people aren't homophobes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it because it gets to you.</v>

1181
00:49:16.961 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 3>And if there are any journalists </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching this,</v>

1182
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:20.470
<v Speaker 3>please just learn this lesson.</v>

1183
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does show you how pervasive the </v>

1184
00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:25.690
<v Speaker 1>ideology is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this controlling ideology,</v>

1185
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:26.703
<v Speaker 1>because I see even now when I'm with </v>
<v Speaker 1>just some of my gay friends who are </v>

1186
00:49:30.371 --> 00:49:34.190
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be the most over the top and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not politically correct and all that and</v>

1187
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:38.090
<v Speaker 1>actually be the politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1188
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:39.283
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what this goes to what I was </v>

1189
00:49:40.301 --> 00:49:42.340
<v Speaker 1>saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no way this ideology,</v>

1190
00:49:42.341 --> 00:49:43.174
<v Speaker 1>what it wants is not you because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want you as the individual at </v>

1191
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:47.310
<v Speaker 1>once you as the collective and then,</v>

1192
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.453
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants you as the identity as the </v>

1193
00:49:51.581 --> 00:49:52.361
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1194
00:49:52.361 --> 00:49:53.194
<v Speaker 2>So you're black or you're gay or you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>a trainee and he wants to put you in </v>

1195
00:49:56.261 --> 00:49:57.094
<v Speaker 2>that bucket and tell you what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to believe about things and </v>

1196
00:49:59.081 --> 00:49:59.914
<v Speaker 2>tell you how to get what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're not pair to work and you </v>

1197
00:50:02.591 --> 00:50:03.424
<v Speaker 2>have no skills because you can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend to be offended about things and </v>

1198
00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:08.680
<v Speaker 2>you'll get on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1199
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:10.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want you as that they want you as a</v>

1200
00:50:10.271 --> 00:50:11.104
<v Speaker 2>bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Gay gay men have fallen for this </v>

1201
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:15.280
<v Speaker 2>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>line and sinker.</v>

1202
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:19.180
<v Speaker 2>It really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But fortunately there is an awakening in</v>

1203
00:50:19.181 --> 00:50:20.014
<v Speaker 2>the gay community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something happening and there </v>

1204
00:50:20.971 --> 00:50:21.804
<v Speaker 2>was something happening among gay people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've noticed it identify antics and </v>

1205
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed it in on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something with gay,</v>

1206
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.590
<v Speaker 3>so they're beginning to recognize the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left is not their friend.</v>

1207
00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:33.500
<v Speaker 3>They're beginning to rediscover the </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtues.</v>

1208
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:35.090
<v Speaker 3>When we were talking in the last show </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

1209
00:50:35.091 --> 00:50:35.924
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the great things about gay life </v>

1210
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:39.680
<v Speaker 3>is you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be outrageous and diff different</v>

1211
00:50:39.681 --> 00:50:42.230
<v Speaker 3>and you can to topple out of a club on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monday afternoon,</v>

1212
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:43.064
<v Speaker 3>like dragged off your face and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the cock and every orifice you can </v>

1213
00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:46.790
<v Speaker 3>do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do whatever you want.</v>

1214
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1215
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:48.343
<v Speaker 3>It's that bit of gay life that creates </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the arts and artists and </v>

1216
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:52.424
<v Speaker 3>inventors and genius is why we're so </v>
<v Speaker 3>overrepresented and all the people that </v>

1217
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.090
<v Speaker 3>shoves society forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1218
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.760
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of gay life that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>liked.</v>

1219
00:50:57.761 --> 00:50:59.120
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of gay life that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrate.</v>

1220
00:50:59.121 --> 00:51:01.810
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of gay culture I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>is valuable and gay people.</v>

1221
00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:02.643
<v Speaker 3>So until we discovered this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's as the left is not their </v>

1222
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:04.844
<v Speaker 3>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that feminists don't have their </v>

1223
00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.640
<v Speaker 3>interests at heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1224
00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.360
<v Speaker 3>that in fact there's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fundamentally hostile to many of</v>

1225
00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 3>the many of the things that make being </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay.</v>

1226
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for the,</v>

1227
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:15.350
<v Speaker 3>for these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1228
00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.850
<v Speaker 3>for gays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lesbians,</v>

1229
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:21.160
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they see the left defending Islam,</v>

1230
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Islam and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

1231
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:23.293
<v Speaker 3>I could be that these people want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw us off of roofs and put us on </v>

1232
00:51:26.271 --> 00:51:28.070
<v Speaker 3>cranes in 11 countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1233
00:51:28.071 --> 00:51:28.904
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then for some reason the leftists </v>

1234
00:51:31.941 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 3>feel the need to defend this idiot's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1235
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:35.400
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1236
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.280
<v Speaker 3>how can you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you support this?</v>

1237
00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:38.400
<v Speaker 3>How can you support this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1238
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:39.303
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want what they want is for us to </v>

1239
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:45.590
<v Speaker 3>expect us to believe that above gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1240
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.900
<v Speaker 3>above women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>above blacks,</v>

1241
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the blanks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the worst thing,</v>

1242
00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:49.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1243
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually,</v>

1244
00:51:51.411 --> 00:51:52.244
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one group of people in this </v>

1245
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:58.361
<v Speaker 3>country who are genuine grievances who </v>
<v Speaker 3>to whom something is still owed.</v>

1246
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.980
<v Speaker 3>And that's the black community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1247
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.053
<v Speaker 3>There is a legacy from slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't happen to believe that black </v>

1248
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:04.244
<v Speaker 3>lives matter is the honest because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's hateful and divisive and the </v>

1249
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:08.570
<v Speaker 3>only real result of black lives matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>is black cities in flames.</v>

1250
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:10.370
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not gloss over that because people</v>

1251
00:52:10.371 --> 00:52:12.890
<v Speaker 3>are gonna are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to go after what you just said.</v>

1252
00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:13.903
<v Speaker 3>You're saying that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the black community does have </v>

1253
00:52:14.961 --> 00:52:15.794
<v Speaker 3>legitimate grievances of course were </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought here by and large as slaves of </v>

1254
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:18.883
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then did anybody ever suggest </v>

1255
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:22.940
<v Speaker 3>otherwise?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people would say,</v>

1256
00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're against black lives matter,</v>

1257
00:52:24.711 --> 00:52:25.544
<v Speaker 3>you're against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's done more for the black </v>

1258
00:52:26.061 --> 00:52:28.280
<v Speaker 3>community than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm normally on went back.</v>

1259
00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.260
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1260
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:31.490
<v Speaker 3>the issue is that the issue is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>straightforward.</v>

1261
00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black lives matter is,</v>

1262
00:52:33.021 --> 00:52:34.850
<v Speaker 3>hate is a hate for supremacy </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>

1263
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm in so far as it's organized at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

1264
00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:41.690
<v Speaker 3>is it's a movement of black supremacy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a bad thing.</v>

1265
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.950
<v Speaker 3>But this is what the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1266
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:45.620
<v Speaker 3>this is what the left likes to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find people.</v>

1267
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.190
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing this all back to trump.</v>

1268
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:50.323
<v Speaker 3>So what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't heard you say is anything </v>

1269
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:55.400
<v Speaker 3>related to policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but before I even let you answer that,</v>

1270
00:52:55.401 --> 00:52:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're just saying is it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely irrelevant.</v>

1271
00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.713
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this movement has nothing to not </v>

1272
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:03.063
<v Speaker 3>political movement in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nobody to take trump's place </v>

1273
00:53:05.751 --> 00:53:06.261
<v Speaker 3>after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1274
00:53:06.261 --> 00:53:09.500
<v Speaker 3>If trump became president via via all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff,</v>

1275
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:11.830
<v Speaker 3>all of this cultural stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a great president.</v>

1276
00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:13.200
<v Speaker 3>He's B.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's creating.</v>

1277
00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.270
<v Speaker 3>It's you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's you.</v>

1278
00:53:14.271 --> 00:53:18.110
<v Speaker 3>Your vp was creating a culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to honor you for a second.</v>

1279
00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:19.820
<v Speaker 3>You would be a good price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would be a fantastic.</v>

1280
00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:20.973
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you feel like answering a </v>

1281
00:53:22.541 --> 00:53:24.560
<v Speaker 3>questions today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going shopping.</v>

1282
00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:26.480
<v Speaker 3>Put your comments in the box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See you later,</v>

1283
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:29.370
<v Speaker 3>but what you're talking about is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural revolution,</v>

1284
00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:30.204
<v Speaker 3>not a political revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's interesting because Bernie </v>

1285
00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:33.053
<v Speaker 3>who's talking a lot about flip the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system and our system's corrupt and </v>

1286
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:36.780
<v Speaker 3>money and politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing.</v>

1287
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:40.560
<v Speaker 3>He's talking about a political </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution and basically you're saying,</v>

1288
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:41.291
<v Speaker 3>forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1289
00:53:41.291 --> 00:53:44.100
<v Speaker 3>That's just because he's an idiot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's 20 years out of date.</v>

1290
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:47.540
<v Speaker 3>That would have worked before when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were upset about economics,</v>

1291
00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 3>upset about foreign policy and politics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you want to work 10 years ago,</v>

1292
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:52.860
<v Speaker 3>the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this war is cultural.</v>

1293
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:54.143
<v Speaker 3>There's a cultural war and as any one </v>
<v Speaker 3>candidate for president fighting this </v>

1294
00:53:56.551 --> 00:53:57.384
<v Speaker 3>war culturally and it's trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't care too much whether he is </v>

1295
00:54:00.211 --> 00:54:01.044
<v Speaker 3>occasionally inconsistent on policy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he understands that nobody else </v>

1296
00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:04.044
<v Speaker 3>does either.</v>

1297
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.600
<v Speaker 3>And he's very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a sad thing.</v>

1298
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sad about.</v>

1299
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:09.770
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1300
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:13.070
<v Speaker 3>I studied politics set over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you study politics,</v>

1301
00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:14.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goals once he's made two very clear </v>

1302
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.200
<v Speaker 3>statements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is that he wants to build a wall and</v>

1303
00:54:22.201 --> 00:54:23.034
<v Speaker 3>that's emblematic of what he believes </v>
<v Speaker 3>about immigration and illegal </v>

1304
00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:28.500
<v Speaker 3>immigration in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can come over as he says,</v>

1305
00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:30.730
<v Speaker 3>but they've got to come over legally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1306
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:35.490
<v Speaker 3>which in and of itself isn't racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing racist about that.</v>

1307
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.353
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people keep Mexicans out of the race </v>

1308
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:38.550
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On that.</v>

1309
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:39.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1310
00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:40.533
<v Speaker 3>his Hispanic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you Americans have this or </v>

1311
00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:44.680
<v Speaker 3>Hispanic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you try to,</v>

1312
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:45.523
<v Speaker 3>you try to invent like divisions between</v>
<v Speaker 3>people so that anything anyone says </v>

1313
00:54:48.271 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 3>about anyone can somehow be called </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>

1314
00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Hispanics away on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I'll bring the chart next time.</v>

1315
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get bogged down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a new thing or the thing,</v>

1316
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:56.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you people,</v>

1317
00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:57.750
<v Speaker 3>you people make these rules up.</v>

1318
00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.000
<v Speaker 3>We just have to live in it and live it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They live in your world.</v>

1319
00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it's not racist if,</v>

1320
00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:05.200
<v Speaker 3>what he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's saying is that there is um,</v>

1321
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:06.103
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in fact of course is his concerns </v>

1322
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:12.240
<v Speaker 3>about immigration benefit the black </v>
<v Speaker 3>community more than anybody else because</v>

1323
00:55:12.241 --> 00:55:15.240
<v Speaker 3>when you Hispanic immigrants come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's black wages.</v>

1324
00:55:15.241 --> 00:55:16.074
<v Speaker 3>They depressed not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1325
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.300
<v Speaker 3>not primarily necessarily white wages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1326
00:55:18.301 --> 00:55:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Barack Obama said something to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect when he was running for president</v>

1327
00:55:21.091 --> 00:55:21.940
<v Speaker 3>the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1328
00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:23.400
<v Speaker 3>He's done so much for the black </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

1329
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:24.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racial,</v>

1330
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.320
<v Speaker 3>racial harmony in America now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such a lovely thing.</v>

1331
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:30.210
<v Speaker 3>Eight years of Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't we all just love each other?</v>

1332
00:55:30.211 --> 00:55:31.044
<v Speaker 3>After eight years of Obama now he's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>the has been the most disastrous </v>

1333
00:55:33.481 --> 00:55:35.220
<v Speaker 3>president for blacks in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

1334
00:55:35.221 --> 00:55:36.054
<v Speaker 3>Is that Obama's biggest failure then </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he came in with the political and </v>

1335
00:55:39.301 --> 00:55:40.800
<v Speaker 3>cultural revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1336
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.400
<v Speaker 3>It was political and it was cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had both elements to it,</v>

1337
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:46.950
<v Speaker 3>but what he's going to exit with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless,</v>

1338
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:47.833
<v Speaker 3>everything comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is worse and everything is </v>

1339
00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:52.080
<v Speaker 3>worse as a result of him will the </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy.</v>

1340
00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The American economy is better right now</v>

1341
00:55:54.961 --> 00:55:56.400
<v Speaker 3>than it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1342
00:55:56.401 --> 00:55:58.980
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but give me silica.</v>

1343
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:01.570
<v Speaker 3>Gays can get married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're not a big proponent.</v>

1344
00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I wish they would stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1345
00:56:03.661 --> 00:56:05.830
<v Speaker 3>but I wish they would name a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality.</v>

1346
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:06.683
<v Speaker 3>Getting married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to ask your group and they </v>

1347
00:56:08.281 --> 00:56:10.130
<v Speaker 3>don't work as hard because they will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1348
00:56:10.131 --> 00:56:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of that come of our Michael Cook for</v>

1349
00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.040
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought sake,</v>

1350
00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.840
<v Speaker 3>but I know you're furry quality so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know you're okay with ish.</v>

1351
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Ish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ish.</v>

1352
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 3>So is that really his failure that at </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he leaves this thing,</v>

1353
00:56:24.281 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 3>after eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what could be ushered in after,</v>

1354
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:27.784
<v Speaker 3>and not that it's purely his fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what can be ushered in after is </v>

1355
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:32.290
<v Speaker 3>going to be a complete flip of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

1356
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that sounds good.</v>

1357
00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.760
<v Speaker 3>That sounds good to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a failure.</v>

1358
00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:37.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1359
00:56:37.281 --> 00:56:38.114
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in exciting times when pretty </v>

1360
00:56:40.731 --> 00:56:43.040
<v Speaker 2>much everyone in the country wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment to suffer.</v>

1361
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much everyone in the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>hates journalists,</v>

1362
00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.490
<v Speaker 2>hates politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hates the,</v>

1363
00:56:46.491 --> 00:56:47.324
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more they find out about what their </v>

1364
00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:50.210
<v Speaker 2>kids are being taught at college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Largely thanks to me,</v>

1365
00:56:50.211 --> 00:56:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hate that too.</v>

1366
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:55.880
<v Speaker 2>And we live in exciting times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want to tear this system apart.</v>

1367
00:56:55.881 --> 00:56:57.380
<v Speaker 2>They want to rebuild the system in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>

1368
00:56:57.381 --> 00:56:58.214
<v Speaker 2>I've suggested that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd quite like to do it along </v>

1369
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:00.833
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian libertarian lines because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes more sense the way </v>

1370
00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:05.270
<v Speaker 2>people communicate these days and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's priorities.</v>

1371
00:57:05.271 --> 00:57:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I think people are more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture than,</v>

1372
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.260
<v Speaker 2>than economics selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1373
00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:11.780
<v Speaker 2>that's the sort of realignment I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>May look very different.</v>

1374
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1375
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:15.043
<v Speaker 2>what I like about daddy like about trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that he is introducing an element of </v>

1376
00:57:20.421 --> 00:57:25.421
<v Speaker 2>realness and an element of fun and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mischief into an arena in which into,</v>

1377
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.353
<v Speaker 2>into public life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an arena in which there has </v>

1378
00:57:28.281 --> 00:57:33.281
<v Speaker 2>been so little freedom and joy for so </v>
<v Speaker 2>long that is unnecessary correction,</v>

1379
00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that can't make jokes on TV anymore.</v>

1380
00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Life isn't fun anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a journalist,</v>

1381
00:57:40.581 --> 00:57:42.530
<v Speaker 2>like if I were a regular journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try and have a,</v>

1382
00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.750
<v Speaker 2>not a regular journalist because I work </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a wonderful place.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So if I'm a regular journalist Ip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say it's a miserable life.</v>

1392
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:00.693
<v Speaker 2>They can't say you can't tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell facts because somebody </v>

1393
00:58:04.071 --> 00:58:05.120
<v Speaker 2>somewhere will get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1394
00:58:05.121 --> 00:58:05.954
<v Speaker 2>you can't say facts was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism has become now more about </v>

1395
00:58:08.541 --> 00:58:09.374
<v Speaker 2>virtue signaling to your fellow </v>
<v Speaker 2>reporters than telling the truth about </v>

1396
00:58:13.521 --> 00:58:14.110
<v Speaker 2>what's actually happening.</v>

1397
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:14.943
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got into a big fight with a </v>

1398
00:58:15.521 --> 00:58:16.354
<v Speaker 3>buzzfeed guy this week because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote a piece about the regressive left </v>

1399
00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:22.370
<v Speaker 3>claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet claim you fall with this guy had a</v>

1400
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:23.223
<v Speaker 3>soft spot for Joe Bernstein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't even want to give him any </v>

1401
00:58:25.031 --> 00:58:25.900
<v Speaker 3>extra cred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1402
00:58:25.901 --> 00:58:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Let's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to waste any set.</v>

1403
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.750
<v Speaker 3>And even name him the left as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what the lab.</v>

1404
00:58:30.751 --> 00:58:33.730
<v Speaker 3>So I left the voldemort left us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you want an.</v>

1405
00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.180
<v Speaker 3>Somebody is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Will shine the light on guy your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your progressive,</v>

1407
00:58:39.491 --> 00:58:41.830
<v Speaker 3>your natural progressive tendencies just</v>
<v Speaker 3>slipped out.</v>

1408
00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.210
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy,</v>

1409
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:44.103
<v Speaker 3>you want to put him under the credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you sent this Guy Bernstein from </v>

1410
00:58:47.951 --> 00:58:49.450
<v Speaker 3>buzzfeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Bernstein.</v>

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.120
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want the.</v>

1412
00:58:52.121 --> 00:58:52.954
<v Speaker 3>I want the full light of scrutiny on </v>
<v Speaker 3>every one I disagree with so that other </v>

1413
00:58:56.351 --> 00:58:57.184
<v Speaker 3>people can see their wrong too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy basically wrote a piece on </v>

1414
00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Joel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joel.</v>

1415
00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Joel Bernstein wrote a piece on buzzfeed</v>
<v Speaker 3>this week.</v>

1416
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:07.923
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to call me a cultural </v>

1417
00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:09.683
<v Speaker 3>librarians.</v>

1418
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:12.743
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not that because I'm a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarianism and because he's never </v>

1419
00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:17.674
<v Speaker 3>got the balls to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you really mean that about both </v>

1420
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 3>your librarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was great,</v>

1421
00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:22.641
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1422
00:59:22.641 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Well you just went straight back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking reference section.</v>

1423
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.073
<v Speaker 3>So Joe Burns OPA and stained from busboy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gives feedback on basically saying </v>

1424
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:32.340
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1425
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:34.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my guy as in Sam,</v>

1426
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few others will mark,</v>

1427
00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>created this regressive lessons.</v>

1428
00:59:37.191 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 3>But really what the regressive left </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is about.</v>

1429
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:41.420
<v Speaker 3>It's about alt right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hate.</v>

1430
00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:42.254
<v Speaker 3>And those are the people that have made </v>
<v Speaker 3>it a thing where I know and every </v>

1431
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:45.913
<v Speaker 3>instance of it on twitter and everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>else is because of the few people that </v>

1432
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:50.174
<v Speaker 3>are left on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like myself who has tried to make it </v>

1433
00:59:52.071 --> 00:59:53.160
<v Speaker 3>into something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now again,</v>

1434
00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:56.580
<v Speaker 3>that sounds like insider baseball stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's about that.</v>

1435
00:59:56.730 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 3>But he wrote a piece about me that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong to what I did notice.</v>

1436
00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.490
<v Speaker 3>You have like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1437
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't mention his name.</v>

1438
01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did instead was,</v>

1439
01:00:03.921 --> 01:00:06.260
<v Speaker 3>I challenged them to debate me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said to bait me,</v>

1440
01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:08.330
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you $5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rock up one hour,</v>

1441
01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.470
<v Speaker 3>debate me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're wrong.</v>

1442
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Prove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prove,</v>

1443
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:13.760
<v Speaker 3>prove your case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scurried into a whole silence,</v>

1444
01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:16.610
<v Speaker 3>carried into a hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually went up to $6.</v>

1445
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.340
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be fair to Joe Bernstein of Buzzfeed,</v>

1446
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 3>buzzfeed takes at Bernstein on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

1447
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:24.023
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1448
01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.740
<v Speaker 3>To be fair to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since then we've,</v>

1449
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.470
<v Speaker 3>we've worked together and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1450
01:00:29.471 --> 01:00:31.190
<v Speaker 3>when pcs he's broken some news for me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1451
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:32.263
<v Speaker 3>and he's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1452
01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.660
<v Speaker 3>he's been very fair and very reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1453
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.533
<v Speaker 3>but he was wrong about that and refused </v>
<v Speaker 3>to debate because he knew he couldn't </v>

1454
01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.300
<v Speaker 3>defend his arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1455
01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.420
<v Speaker 3>the same thing I think applies with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1456
01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he'd be able to defend his</v>
<v Speaker 3>position on that piece,</v>

1457
01:00:45.081 --> 01:00:46.400
<v Speaker 3>which was obviously garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1458
01:00:46.401 --> 01:00:49.640
<v Speaker 3>I took it out and they all got hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 3>and thousands of responses to him and he</v>

1459
01:00:49.641 --> 01:00:50.690
<v Speaker 3>ignored all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

1460
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:53.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he'd show up to debate you</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that,</v>

1461
01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.470
<v Speaker 3>but you should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you lend me the fact that,</v>

1462
01:00:54.471 --> 01:00:55.970
<v Speaker 3>well I won't need it because I'd win the</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate.</v>

1463
01:00:55.971 --> 01:00:58.440
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1464
01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:02.210
<v Speaker 3>you can't have any money but it goes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Shapiro now.</v>

1465
01:01:02.211 --> 01:01:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Why do we still have money with guests </v>
<v Speaker 3>on your show?</v>

1466
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:05.990
<v Speaker 3>The ostium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much he was worth,</v>

1467
01:01:05.991 --> 01:01:06.980
<v Speaker 3>how much you earned or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1468
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted him as a,</v>

1469
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a one percenter to,</v>

1470
01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.820
<v Speaker 3>to tell people how much you want a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number I wanted.</v>

1471
01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.030
<v Speaker 3>I said I give you a number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have.</v>

1472
01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:14.903
<v Speaker 3>No he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said he's in the over 400 K I </v>

1473
01:01:17.121 --> 01:01:19.710
<v Speaker 3>guess situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who isn't?</v>

1474
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're really foster right to Laurie.</v>

1475
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.150
<v Speaker 3>Eric and I'll make a note of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1476
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:29.410
<v Speaker 3>So all of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1477
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.313
<v Speaker 3>so trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're laying out a decent case of </v>

1478
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:33.404
<v Speaker 3>putting all this stuff together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let's talk quickly about the </v>

1479
01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.153
<v Speaker 3>pushback from the establishment because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's an under reported piece </v>

1480
01:01:40.971 --> 01:01:44.810
<v Speaker 3>about this that the establishment has </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried very hard to push back on this and</v>

1481
01:01:44.811 --> 01:01:45.644
<v Speaker 3>they are rolling out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitt Romney lost guy who lost last time </v>

1482
01:01:48.191 --> 01:01:49.170
<v Speaker 3>is supposed to be the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1483
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:51.890
<v Speaker 3>You roll out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Lindsey Graham goes from failed</v>

1484
01:01:51.891 --> 01:01:53.480
<v Speaker 3>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He endorses another failed candidate,</v>

1485
01:01:53.481 --> 01:01:54.314
<v Speaker 3>but another like they just roll out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same guys and then if you watch the </v>

1486
01:01:56.301 --> 01:01:57.134
<v Speaker 3>debates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've watched 90 percent of them </v>

1487
01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:01.550
<v Speaker 3>trump systematically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you agree with him or not,</v>

1488
01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:02.653
<v Speaker 3>systematically destroys these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he embarrassed your voice </v>

1489
01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.900
<v Speaker 3>actually is worsening system </v>
<v Speaker 3>systematically destroys these people.</v>

1490
01:02:08.901 --> 01:02:09.734
<v Speaker 3>I mean here he seems to have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly a consistent approach to </v>

1491
01:02:12.531 --> 01:02:13.850
<v Speaker 3>destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just rocks up.</v>

1492
01:02:13.851 --> 01:02:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Cracks a few jokes and tell slip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell tells it how it is.</v>

1493
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 3>It's actually unsystematic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is even more of an indictment on</v>

1494
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.620
<v Speaker 2>the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How delmia,</v>

1495
01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:22.523
<v Speaker 2>how stupid they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think we're also the only thing </v>

1496
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.530
<v Speaker 2>where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1497
01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.393
<v Speaker 2>So do you think if they had put the </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment had found someone that </v>

1498
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:32.970
<v Speaker 2>basically knew who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had decent conservative principles.</v>

1499
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:33.923
<v Speaker 2>So it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the closest to that could have </v>

1500
01:02:35.911 --> 01:02:36.744
<v Speaker 2>possibly been jeb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bush name was so damaged and he </v>

1501
01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:43.200
<v Speaker 2>was also a terrible candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a classic cook.</v>

1502
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's saying he's,</v>

1503
01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.860
<v Speaker 2>as we say on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So coq one have you defined cock because</v>

1504
01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I see this popping up all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1505
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.013
<v Speaker 2>so I like this word and all the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conservative media don't because </v>

1506
01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:52.980
<v Speaker 2>they know it describes them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1507
01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:54.410
<v Speaker 2>and it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

1508
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:55.283
<v Speaker 2>So I know that you probably don't watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>any pornography anymore because since </v>

1509
01:02:57.691 --> 01:03:00.780
<v Speaker 2>you've been with your partner for </v>
<v Speaker 2>ceremonial life,</v>

1510
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:03.360
<v Speaker 2>more like a lesbian.</v>

1511
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:03.941
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

1512
01:03:03.941 --> 01:03:07.440
<v Speaker 2>just sexless knew about carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1513
01:03:07.441 --> 01:03:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to socal about phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>

1514
01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.753
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were a porn viewers are not </v>

1515
01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:12.810
<v Speaker 2>particularly important for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1516
01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.480
<v Speaker 2>if you were a point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1517
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:18.960
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want that to be a shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doubled down on that one.</v>

1518
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.633
<v Speaker 2>If you were a porn viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may be familiar with genre of porn </v>

1519
01:03:24.181 --> 01:03:29.181
<v Speaker 2>in which sort of white husband watches </v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife get rammed by a large black man</v>

1520
01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:32.460
<v Speaker 2>that's not always a large black man at </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes at this,</v>

1521
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:33.303
<v Speaker 2>whatever this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cockiness is cuckold tree from </v>

1522
01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare and chaucer to where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't anything to do with race.</v>

1523
01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's specifically to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest is just sort of become a bit of</v>

1524
01:03:43.261 --> 01:03:44.190
<v Speaker 2>a ponder them as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1525
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:45.503
<v Speaker 2>the idea is it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's people who have sold out and </v>

1526
01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:49.200
<v Speaker 2>enjoying watching their wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their country.</v>

1527
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 2>They're people that are supposed to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>after whether its readers in the case of</v>

1528
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 2>journalist stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1529
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:53.703
<v Speaker 2>constituents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case of politicians getting fucked </v>

1530
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:56.180
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1531
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:58.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some scarier external force,</v>

1532
01:03:58.381 --> 01:04:01.350
<v Speaker 2>whether it's radical Islam or mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration or whatever.</v>

1533
01:04:01.351 --> 01:04:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Now it's metaphoric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a metaphor,</v>

1534
01:04:03.301 --> 01:04:04.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1535
01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.970
<v Speaker 2>and it's a perfectly good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1536
01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.670
<v Speaker 2>and perfectly fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vibrant sort of metaphor.</v>

1537
01:04:08.671 --> 01:04:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I quite like it and I use it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fun and it's,</v>

1538
01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:12.430
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1539
01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.040
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1540
01:04:14.041 --> 01:04:16.260
<v Speaker 2>conservatives now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conservative establishment,</v>

1541
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:17.123
<v Speaker 2>which is basically gotten along with all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the tenants of the left and now look </v>

1542
01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.410
<v Speaker 2>to the left for approval.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it okay?</v>

1543
01:04:22.411 --> 01:04:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Can I say this as this racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist than the right,</v>

1544
01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:27.100
<v Speaker 2>the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Establishment.</v>

1545
01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:27.953
<v Speaker 2>So terrified of being seen as racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they sort of distanced themselves </v>

1546
01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:34.410
<v Speaker 2>from this word in case or any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>racial connotations whatsoever.</v>

1547
01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:34.831
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1548
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:36.210
<v Speaker 2>we can't go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1549
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Jeb has a bit of a perfect example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1550
01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:41.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who is weak,</v>

1551
01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:43.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is it?</v>

1552
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:46.770
<v Speaker 2>There's no sense with with Jeb Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was never any sense,</v>

1553
01:04:46.771 --> 01:04:47.604
<v Speaker 2>and I feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry he's gone now because it was kind </v>

1554
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 2>of Nice Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no sense he would ever stick</v>

1555
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:52.374
<v Speaker 2>up for his country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the one thing you can't say about </v>

1556
01:04:54.451 --> 01:04:56.520
<v Speaker 2>trump is that he wouldn't stick up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

1557
01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:57.354
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may disagree with some of his </v>

1558
01:04:57.661 --> 01:05:00.150
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he clearly loves the country.</v>

1559
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.970
<v Speaker 2>He clearly wants America to be great </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1560
01:05:02.971 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a very provocative slogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make America great again.</v>

1561
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:07.470
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1562
01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:10.630
<v Speaker 2>has that something was lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1563
01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:11.730
<v Speaker 2>As a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1564
01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.930
<v Speaker 2>there's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big shocking claim in there,</v>

1565
01:05:14.931 --> 01:05:17.260
<v Speaker 2>one that politicians don't normally </v>
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>

1566
01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:19.240
<v Speaker 2>that the country is not great.</v>

1567
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:19.751
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1568
01:05:19.751 --> 01:05:22.330
<v Speaker 2>is this sort of thing you normally hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>from liberals if we're honest,</v>

1569
01:05:22.331 --> 01:05:23.164
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama clearly doesn't like this country </v>

1570
01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:24.610
<v Speaker 2>very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1571
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:25.483
<v Speaker 2>we generally hear it from conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's something very exciting </v>

1572
01:05:29.381 --> 01:05:30.500
<v Speaker 2>going on with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1573
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.640
<v Speaker 2>with this candidate is something very </v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting,</v>

1574
01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.990
<v Speaker 2>all that terrifies establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I've,</v>

1575
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.393
<v Speaker 2>what I've realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is really interesting is </v>

1576
01:05:39.071 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>that the trump has illustrated that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerns of the elites,</v>

1577
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:44.223
<v Speaker 2>the concerns of the establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concerns of journalists and </v>

1578
01:05:45.851 --> 01:05:46.684
<v Speaker 2>politicians and the people who run our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives are so alien from ordinary people </v>

1579
01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:51.244
<v Speaker 2>care about that they can't even argue </v>
<v Speaker 2>against him and it resonate with the </v>

1580
01:05:54.191 --> 01:05:54.940
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1581
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.430
<v Speaker 2>let's take for example something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I both care about.</v>

1582
01:05:57.550 --> 01:05:59.890
<v Speaker 2>The First Amendment free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of the press.</v>

1583
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Trump has repeatedly suggested that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would like to,</v>

1584
01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:05.920
<v Speaker 2>in some way control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curtail the full freedoms of the press.</v>

1585
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.970
<v Speaker 2>He would like just this week with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington Post that he would like.</v>

1586
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:11.420
<v Speaker 2>He would like to make it more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1587
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I think what he's saying is he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthen defamation law,</v>

1588
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad News,</v>

1589
01:06:16.241 --> 01:06:18.290
<v Speaker 2>particularly for you even more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1590
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it because I don't lie about people.</v>

1591
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.720
<v Speaker 2>I might say funny names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I might ridicule people,</v>

1592
01:06:25.721 --> 01:06:28.560
<v Speaker 2>but I don't lie about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the liberal press does every day.</v>

1593
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:29.543
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the conservative press is just as </v>

1594
01:06:30.071 --> 01:06:30.521
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly.</v>

1595
01:06:30.521 --> 01:06:32.710
<v Speaker 2>They're all terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't label people,</v>

1596
01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't make up facts about people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would I worry about that?</v>

1597
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:36.971
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's.</v>

1598
01:06:36.971 --> 01:06:38.500
<v Speaker 2>And let's look at it from an electrical </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view,</v>

1599
01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The public,</v>

1600
01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:40.504
<v Speaker 2>my head just went through the list of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all my liberal friends that lie </v>

1601
01:06:42.341 --> 01:06:43.510
<v Speaker 2>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly.</v>

1602
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.920
<v Speaker 2>And that would suffer from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1603
01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wouldn't know.</v>

1604
01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>

1605
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:50.283
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say the most appalling things about </v>

1606
01:06:51.431 --> 01:06:52.600
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're true.</v>

1607
01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've never been sued.</v>

1608
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I might have an opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've never been sued.</v>

1609
01:06:56.321 --> 01:06:57.154
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had imagined I'd be in court every </v>

1610
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:58.211
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1611
01:06:58.211 --> 01:06:59.044
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get sued because there's a </v>

1612
01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:03.130
<v Speaker 2>difference between satire and joking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my fat,</v>

1613
01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.560
<v Speaker 2>I get my facts right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1614
01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I know there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people that are in court every</v>

1615
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.350
<v Speaker 2>week and it's Gorka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1616
01:07:08.351 --> 01:07:11.230
<v Speaker 2>because they are so completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unethical.</v>

1617
01:07:11.231 --> 01:07:12.064
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why the right felt that the </v>

1618
01:07:13.181 --> 01:07:15.250
<v Speaker 2>gawker thing with Hogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we're jumping all over the place.</v>

1619
01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:18.530
<v Speaker 2>That's why we enjoyed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really loved.</v>

1620
01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:22.270
<v Speaker 2>But I saw it as a huge victory to </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have places like awkward that</v>

1621
01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:25.270
<v Speaker 2>are just better literally trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy lives.</v>

1622
01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:29.760
<v Speaker 2>It's enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our private citizens anyway.</v>

1623
01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:30.683
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1624
01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:32.680
<v Speaker 2>the approach that we'll probably get </v>
<v Speaker 2>overturned on appeal,</v>

1625
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.813
<v Speaker 2>and it's probably better that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an anti free speech precedent of </v>

1626
01:07:35.471 --> 01:07:36.304
<v Speaker 2>quite that nature because who knows what</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of sex tapes might be in the </v>

1627
01:07:38.201 --> 01:07:39.520
<v Speaker 2>public interest in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in future.</v>

1628
01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two things is,</v>

1629
01:07:41.171 --> 01:07:42.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinellas County,</v>

1630
01:07:42.461 --> 01:07:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Florida juries don't set legal precedent</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to get overturned.</v>

1631
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.690
<v Speaker 2>So it'll be a pdf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1632
01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:53.700
<v Speaker 2>we'll see on the trump thing when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says that the press are the bad guys.</v>

1633
01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.733
<v Speaker 2>Most people agree with him and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the press doesn't understand </v>

1634
01:07:59.050 --> 01:07:59.883
<v Speaker 2>because they genuinely believe that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are like some sort of true warriors for </v>

1635
01:08:03.191 --> 01:08:04.450
<v Speaker 2>Truth and justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

1636
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.610
<v Speaker 2>they're the bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The media in this country,</v>

1637
01:08:06.611 --> 01:08:07.444
<v Speaker 2>there's been a systemic industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white failure to tell the truth in this </v>

1638
01:08:09.671 --> 01:08:10.031
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1639
01:08:10.031 --> 01:08:10.864
<v Speaker 2>that's the normal situation under which </v>
<v Speaker 2>the government steps in and that's what </v>

1640
01:08:12.851 --> 01:08:13.750
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's oil.</v>

1641
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.673
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's some other kind of industry </v>

1642
01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.380
<v Speaker 2>when there is a system wide failure in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an industry banking,</v>

1643
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:21.500
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government steps in and you know,</v>

1644
01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:22.363
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment should insulate you from the </v>

1645
01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:25.844
<v Speaker 2>consequences of your actions if you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and deliberately mendaciously </v>

1646
01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:32.900
<v Speaker 2>knowingly lie about people in the key </v>
<v Speaker 2>word is knowingly or unknowingly.</v>

1647
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Now the libel standardization</v>

1648
01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:36.010
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slippery slope though.</v>

1649
01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Well I wouldn't say the guy who gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>offended by Megan Kelly every other day,</v>

1650
01:08:39.971 --> 01:08:41.380
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what he thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's.</v>

1651
01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I think she's a hell of a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggered by him than he is by her.</v>

1652
01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Well that may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's on his way to becoming the most</v>

1653
01:08:47.021 --> 01:08:49.270
<v Speaker 1>powerful man on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's just a reporter.</v>

1654
01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:52.000
<v Speaker 1>So I get what you're saying that if she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she's telling the truth,</v>

1655
01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:53.440
<v Speaker 1>then fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I would say,</v>

1656
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:56.620
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth when you have the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>defend,</v>

1657
01:08:56.650 --> 01:08:58.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy who loves giving a fence,</v>

1658
01:08:58.781 --> 01:09:00.820
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time he's incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>thin skinned.</v>

1659
01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's putting in libel law </v>
<v Speaker 1>know the president can't do that.</v>

1660
01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:05.920
<v Speaker 1>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not thin skinned.</v>

1661
01:09:05.921 --> 01:09:06.830
<v Speaker 1>At all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is</v>

1662
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:12.580
<v Speaker 2>very smart game where he is illustrating</v>
<v Speaker 2>the absurdities of the fence,</v>

1663
01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:14.093
<v Speaker 2>taking an offense culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing is you've got to </v>

1664
01:09:15.491 --> 01:09:16.430
<v Speaker 2>understand about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

1665
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:17.750
<v Speaker 2>it didn't become a billionaire by </v>
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>

1666
01:09:17.751 --> 01:09:20.030
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the smartest people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

1667
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so clever.</v>

1668
01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Everything he does is calculated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything he does is designed to create</v>

1669
01:09:24.981 --> 01:09:27.120
<v Speaker 2>a particular effect or designed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1670
01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:28.103
<v Speaker 2>to reach a certain goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He'd been using bankruptcy to his </v>

1671
01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:31.990
<v Speaker 2>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we proved who wouldn't,</v>

1672
01:09:31.991 --> 01:09:34.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals love to do this bullshit,</v>

1673
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:35.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1674
01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.350
<v Speaker 2>of course he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a business man.</v>

1675
01:09:36.351 --> 01:09:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Of course he donated to Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So would I,</v>

1676
01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:41.090
<v Speaker 2>if I was running a business and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a strategic advantage,</v>

1677
01:09:41.091 --> 01:09:44.240
<v Speaker 2>I'd of course I go to a wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have her at my wedding or whatever.</v>

1678
01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 1>That probably wasn't the best moment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first debate.</v>

1679
01:09:46.341 --> 01:09:47.950
<v Speaker 1>When he admitted it is,</v>

1680
01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.490
<v Speaker 2>of course you would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so dumbed suggest otherwise.</v>

1681
01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:52.503
<v Speaker 2>The reason it offends people so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason it surprised me so much </v>

1682
01:09:54.611 --> 01:09:56.950
<v Speaker 2>as most politicians have never done </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything other than politics.</v>

1683
01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:00.370
<v Speaker 2>So if they cozy up to a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like treachery or it looks like</v>

1684
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.233
<v Speaker 2>inconsistency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like ideological kind of </v>

1685
01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.353
<v Speaker 2>Tomfoolery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While trump is never been in that </v>

1686
01:10:06.281 --> 01:10:07.330
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a business man.</v>

1687
01:10:07.331 --> 01:10:08.164
<v Speaker 2>Of course he did these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to just finish on the press </v>

1688
01:10:10.361 --> 01:10:11.194
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When trump says the press the bad guys </v>

1689
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:13.833
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't need speech all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets some of the biggest cheers of </v>

1690
01:10:16.121 --> 01:10:17.350
<v Speaker 2>any of his stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1691
01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.161
<v Speaker 2>When he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1692
01:10:18.161 --> 01:10:18.994
<v Speaker 2>the press will never cover you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The press will never turn around and </v>

1693
01:10:20.651 --> 01:10:22.930
<v Speaker 2>show these huge crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All they'll do is if there's a protest,</v>

1694
01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:23.440
<v Speaker 2>they'll go down there.</v>

1695
01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.221
<v Speaker 2>There's a protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

1696
01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:26.050
<v Speaker 2>these guys are losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're losers.</v>

1697
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.500
<v Speaker 2>They get some of the big those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get some of the biggest applause.</v>

1698
01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:34.270
<v Speaker 2>It's that country hates the press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when the press is like Pearl,</v>

1699
01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:35.800
<v Speaker 2>clutching a about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1700
01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifth amendment or freedom.</v>

1701
01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.230
<v Speaker 2>While you misused to those freedoms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you abused those freedoms.</v>

1702
01:10:41.231 --> 01:10:44.110
<v Speaker 2>You started lying about men lying about </v>
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

1703
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.510
<v Speaker 2>lying about immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lying about Islam,</v>

1704
01:10:46.511 --> 01:10:47.344
<v Speaker 2>lying about everything that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The press has lied systematically to </v>

1705
01:10:50.531 --> 01:10:54.550
<v Speaker 2>everyone about everything everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time for decades.</v>

1706
01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.670
<v Speaker 2>It has abused its its privileges and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1707
01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:01.210
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with trump and with the and with the</v>

1708
01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:02.710
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with most Americans,</v>

1709
01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:05.920
<v Speaker 2>the press is part of the problem and for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to stop poor.</v>

1710
01:11:05.921 --> 01:11:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Clutching about the first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1711
01:11:07.241 --> 01:11:10.420
<v Speaker 2>you know what tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you abused this for decades.</v>

1712
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.333
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you take the power that the </v>

1713
01:11:12.451 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 1>press has a lot of power,</v>

1714
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:17.400
<v Speaker 3>you take the power that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment has on both sides.</v>

1715
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:18.510
<v Speaker 3>A lot of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrats,</v>

1716
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1717
01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:23.070
<v Speaker 3>You add all that up and now we still </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have an election until November,</v>

1718
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in the end of March here.</v>

1719
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Can this thing go forward without </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting much more violent?</v>

1720
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:30.180
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of where I see this all </v>
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>

1721
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.193
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be very clear and say that I don't </v>

1722
01:11:32.701 --> 01:11:34.230
<v Speaker 3>know which way the violence is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come from.</v>

1723
01:11:34.231 --> 01:11:36.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Violence is gonna.</v>

1724
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Just be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to come from.</v>

1725
01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:40.440
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think you should be such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>weasel.</v>

1726
01:11:40.441 --> 01:11:41.840
<v Speaker 3>I think you should say what you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>

1727
01:11:41.841 --> 01:11:45.090
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd probably agree with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to come from the left.</v>

1728
01:11:45.091 --> 01:11:47.520
<v Speaker 3>Just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it comes,</v>

1729
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:48.763
<v Speaker 3>it goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to come from people </v>

1730
01:11:50.221 --> 01:11:51.720
<v Speaker 3>protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump is not going to come from trump.</v>

1731
01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Protesters will look in the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shift and just pick.</v>

1732
01:11:54.451 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Just because he is his chief of staff </v>
<v Speaker 3>grab,</v>

1733
01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be a bit grabby.</v>

1734
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Well of course he is the guy that trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1735
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.800
<v Speaker 3>Trump is so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much risk of being shot.</v>

1736
01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:05.963
<v Speaker 3>I'm like anybody else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's somebody that's gonna get </v>

1737
01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:08.790
<v Speaker 3>assassinated in his country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's trump.</v>

1738
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Is it any wonder the people close to him</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit cautious.</v>

1739
01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't get too much into that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it involves,</v>

1740
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people that used to work with.</v>

1741
01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:15.960
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1742
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.930
<v Speaker 3>if there's going to be violence on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>streets,</v>

1743
01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:21.450
<v Speaker 3>it is not going to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it will be the Bernie people.</v>

1744
01:12:21.451 --> 01:12:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I get that and that's not what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ironic.</v>

1745
01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:24.683
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like Bernie more than I like his </v>

1746
01:12:26.221 --> 01:12:29.070
<v Speaker 3>supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really how I feel because yes,</v>

1747
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:29.520
<v Speaker 3>I do agree.</v>

1748
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.590
<v Speaker 3>If he goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will have been.</v>

1749
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:32.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're right.</v>

1750
01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:35.400
<v Speaker 3>But I just thought as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a decent human being,</v>

1751
01:12:35.401 --> 01:12:36.960
<v Speaker 3>whether I agree with his policies or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1752
01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just somebody,</v>

1753
01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:42.240
<v Speaker 3>somebody who makes excuses as to some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst regimes in the world.</v>

1754
01:12:42.241 --> 01:12:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Somebody wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to institute.</v>

1755
01:12:43.741 --> 01:12:46.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's to socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will make poor people poorer.</v>

1756
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Somebody who wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1757
01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.820
<v Speaker 3>somebody who believes in the lies that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1758
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:50.723
<v Speaker 3>the feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to make this about him </v>

1759
01:12:52.711 --> 01:12:54.930
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't just throw this stuff out.</v>

1760
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you really mean that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean not?</v>

1761
01:12:57.271 --> 01:12:59.440
<v Speaker 3>You think he's a nice person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a nice person.</v>

1762
01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:02.630
<v Speaker 3>I think he believes it more hateful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more unequal.</v>

1763
01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you say it's a nice place in what</v>

1764
01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:06.290
<v Speaker 3>he thinks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The solutions.</v>

1765
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:07.860
<v Speaker 3>So you don't believe in any of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies,</v>

1766
01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:08.820
<v Speaker 3>which you think is a nice person.</v>

1767
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:11.210
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes you can be a decent </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and BNB,</v>

1768
01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.110
<v Speaker 3>wrong policies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got some continual regardless if they</v>

1769
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.600
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the person is.</v>

1770
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I do agree that the violence will comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>from old and left wing,</v>

1771
01:13:23.221 --> 01:13:25.170
<v Speaker 3>that they're nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't do that with right wingers.</v>

1772
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.153
<v Speaker 3>Why do we automatically assume just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's old and doddery and he's </v>

1773
01:13:28.441 --> 01:13:30.670
<v Speaker 3>got white hair and he sounds like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy old lunatic.</v>

1774
01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:31.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be a nice guy,</v>

1775
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:34.280
<v Speaker 3>but I think really nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1776
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.213
<v Speaker 3>he wants socialism in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's poisonous political philosophy </v>

1777
01:13:40.021 --> 01:13:43.550
<v Speaker 3>that has made people suffer everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has ever been tried everywhere.</v>

1778
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not pretending.</v>

1779
01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:50.490
<v Speaker 3>That's why Bernie Sanders is nice to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1780
01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:54.330
<v Speaker 3>Why was he ever don't indicate the is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>decent.</v>

1781
01:13:54.331 --> 01:13:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see it.</v>

1782
01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:56.363
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen any underpinnings of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas that he talks about of trying to </v>

1783
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:01.170
<v Speaker 3>make things more equal and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change the system,</v>

1784
01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:05.580
<v Speaker 3>which is the exact same stuff to feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>body weight,</v>

1785
01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.800
<v Speaker 3>but you're telling me that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the trump revolution,</v>

1786
01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:11.820
<v Speaker 3>a revolution that has a little something</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do with the feeling broke,</v>

1787
01:14:11.821 --> 01:14:13.450
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to get totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>sidetracked on that.</v>

1788
01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:15.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a feeling.</v>

1789
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:16.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not about feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1790
01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:19.030
<v Speaker 3>it has something to do with feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're telling me all these people,</v>

1791
01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:22.020
<v Speaker 3>and I'm agreeing with you on cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarianism is not about feelings.</v>

1792
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.450
<v Speaker 3>Cultural Libertarianism is a response to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a feelings over facts.</v>

1793
01:14:25.451 --> 01:14:26.284
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the defining characteristic of </v>

1794
01:14:26.981 --> 01:14:27.814
<v Speaker 3>cultural libertarianism is a rigorous </v>
<v Speaker 3>adherence to evidence based policy </v>

1795
01:14:31.571 --> 01:14:33.420
<v Speaker 3>making in evidence based beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1796
01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.101
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1797
01:14:34.101 --> 01:14:34.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1798
01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.240
<v Speaker 3>a rigorous insistence on classical </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberalism.</v>

1799
01:14:37.241 --> 01:14:38.074
<v Speaker 3>It's got very little to do with feelings</v>
<v Speaker 3>scholars do with thumb because it's </v>

1800
01:14:40.091 --> 01:14:42.040
<v Speaker 3>often dressed up in a mischievous </v>
<v Speaker 3>package.</v>

1801
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:43.083
<v Speaker 3>But the cultural libertarianism is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction against the feelings based </v>

1802
01:14:45.551 --> 01:14:47.830
<v Speaker 3>arguments of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The feelings makes arguments to the left</v>

1803
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.903
<v Speaker 3>as perfectly lead by Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders is the apotheosis of </v>

1804
01:14:51.731 --> 01:14:53.770
<v Speaker 3>everything you hate 'em,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you still feel the need to call them</v>

1805
01:14:53.771 --> 01:14:55.030
<v Speaker 3>a nice guy because he's old.</v>

1806
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:56.423
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so without getting into a Bernie </v>

1807
01:14:58.601 --> 01:15:00.430
<v Speaker 3>offshoot here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're probably a little late for that.</v>

1808
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I will grant you that if Bernie goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and the.</v>

1809
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.370
<v Speaker 3>The narrative just continues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1810
01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:09.760
<v Speaker 3>it will be his people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that will be violent right now.</v>

1811
01:15:09.761 --> 01:15:10.594
<v Speaker 3>The media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we'll try to blame it on the trump </v>

1812
01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:12.820
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that doesn't mean that there were no</v>

1813
01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:13.654
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that are violent declaratives </v>

1814
01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:16.950
<v Speaker 3>conservatives are blaming it on trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

1815
01:15:16.951 --> 01:15:21.220
<v Speaker 3>it cruise goes on cv the next day after </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever st trump is responsible for the</v>

1816
01:15:21.221 --> 01:15:22.690
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they insane?</v>

1817
01:15:22.710 --> 01:15:23.543
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do they not realize why people are </v>

1818
01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:25.354
<v Speaker 3>voting for this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were voting for this guy because </v>

1819
01:15:26.591 --> 01:15:30.460
<v Speaker 3>you lie like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's astonishing.</v>

1820
01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so at the top of the show,</v>

1821
01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:33.160
<v Speaker 3>what I mentioned was that just this </v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

1822
01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:36.790
<v Speaker 3>trump was giving a speech in Arizona and</v>
<v Speaker 3>these protesters blocked the road.</v>

1823
01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:37.893
<v Speaker 3>These are not people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think they're doing something good </v>

1824
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.620
<v Speaker 3>or they're doing something to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

1825
01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:42.470
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're all there,</v>

1826
01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.090
<v Speaker 3>the rest is just taking a paycheck from </v>
<v Speaker 3>could whatever it is,</v>

1827
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.200
<v Speaker 3>but they think that they're stopping </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump somehow or stopping him from being</v>

1828
01:15:50.201 --> 01:15:51.034
<v Speaker 3>heard are going to stop his movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think all they're doing is </v>

1829
01:15:52.421 --> 01:15:53.254
<v Speaker 3>strengthening him because they need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the basket of ideas because then </v>

1830
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 3>people turn on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look what these people are doing.</v>

1831
01:15:57.730 --> 01:15:58.563
<v Speaker 3>The more these guys protest Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more they show up and they're </v>

1832
01:16:01.331 --> 01:16:03.160
<v Speaker 3>violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like my toxicologist,</v>

1833
01:16:03.161 --> 01:16:05.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's these feminists smeared blood on</v>

1834
01:16:05.081 --> 01:16:06.880
<v Speaker 3>themselves rather than the block.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the stuff.</v>

1835
01:16:06.881 --> 01:16:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Everybody saw the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1836
01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:09.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's suing.</v>

1837
01:16:09.311 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Everybody thought the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1838
01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:11.800
<v Speaker 3>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I must have a point.</v>

1839
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.820
<v Speaker 3>That's what they thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody thinks the same thing when</v>

1840
01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1841
01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:20.140
<v Speaker 3>when these protesters show up for trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they are the hateful,</v>

1842
01:16:20.141 --> 01:16:21.250
<v Speaker 3>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent,</v>

1843
01:16:21.251 --> 01:16:22.180
<v Speaker 3>divisive people.</v>

1844
01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.070
<v Speaker 3>And everybody there for trump is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing.</v>

1845
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.260
<v Speaker 3>They'll run their hats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make America great again.</v>

1846
01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.300
<v Speaker 3>But it's not everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll grant me that,</v>

1847
01:16:28.301 --> 01:16:29.134
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not every day I saw a guy who was </v>

1848
01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.050
<v Speaker 3>screaming at some people go back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Auschwitz.</v>

1849
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:34.180
<v Speaker 3>You see some people go back to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1850
01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.193
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every mood media is cherry picked a few </v>

1851
01:16:37.061 --> 01:16:38.460
<v Speaker 3>from this side versus the view from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside.</v>

1852
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:39.340
<v Speaker 3>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>

1853
01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:40.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying it's not,</v>

1854
01:16:40.861 --> 01:16:41.694
<v Speaker 3>it's not everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not giving the media and he greatly </v>

1855
01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.013
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1856
01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1857
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:45.011
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1858
01:16:45.011 --> 01:16:47.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they're awesome supporters of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump who are,</v>

1859
01:16:47.381 --> 01:16:48.214
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are distasteful people like there </v>

1860
01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:51.260
<v Speaker 3>are supporters of Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1861
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.980
<v Speaker 3>I think pretty much anyone who supports </v>
<v Speaker 3>her at this point just tasteful,</v>

1862
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:55.423
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think pretty much anyone support </v>

1863
01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.990
<v Speaker 3>sanders is just needs to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to read a book.</v>

1864
01:16:59.080 --> 01:16:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1865
01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 3>needs to be educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to,</v>

1866
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.610
<v Speaker 3>needs to reach puberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1867
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:08.990
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is about trump supporters </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my experience,</v>

1868
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 3>vast majority</v>

1869
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.963
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they fall into the various </v>

1870
01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:13.860
<v Speaker 2>buckets of trump supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1871
01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:14.713
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the huge support he has in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the black community for all sorts of </v>

1872
01:17:17.151 --> 01:17:18.860
<v Speaker 2>obvious reasons because he's a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspirational,</v>

1873
01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American dream kind of candidate.</v>

1874
01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my colleague at Breitbart,</v>

1875
01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:23.031
<v Speaker 2>Sandy Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1876
01:17:23.031 --> 01:17:24.170
<v Speaker 2>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she says I love him,</v>

1877
01:17:24.171 --> 01:17:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I love him because when I see trump and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his name on a building and it got a name</v>

1878
01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:28.570
<v Speaker 2>on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want that,</v>

1879
01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:30.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that element to it.</v>

1880
01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1881
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:32.083
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that some people are </v>

1882
01:17:32.661 --> 01:17:33.980
<v Speaker 2>offended by that kind of generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1883
01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1884
01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I said something that I thought you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1885
01:17:37.451 --> 01:17:39.160
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said bling and now.</v>

1886
01:17:39.161 --> 01:17:40.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1887
01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:44.470
<v Speaker 1>that was a bit much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why they like me.</v>

1888
01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:45.391
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1889
01:17:45.391 --> 01:17:46.224
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1890
01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1891
01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:48.523
<v Speaker 2>that he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a very classic aspirational </v>

1892
01:17:50.011 --> 01:17:51.540
<v Speaker 2>candidate for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for black Americans,</v>

1893
01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:52.883
<v Speaker 2>also loved by the gay community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge gay icon as a piece coming out in </v>

1894
01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1895
01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:56.643
<v Speaker 2>and another in vice soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've given interviews for both of these </v>

1896
01:17:59.161 --> 01:18:01.200
<v Speaker 2>places on why so many gay people love </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>

1897
01:18:01.201 --> 01:18:02.230
<v Speaker 2>I think obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1898
01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:03.211
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1899
01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:04.044
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

1900
01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:06.780
<v Speaker 2>but the two big groups which are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like well-educated,</v>

1901
01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.880
<v Speaker 2>sort of what I call generation from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet trolley,</v>

1902
01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:10.763
<v Speaker 2>some outright he cultural libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of trump supporters who by and </v>

1903
01:18:14.221 --> 01:18:15.054
<v Speaker 2>large are the best people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny and interesting and smart </v>

1904
01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:21.870
<v Speaker 2>and brilliant and I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other group which had also the,</v>

1905
01:18:21.871 --> 01:18:22.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1906
01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:23.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the best people in the world,</v>

1907
01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:24.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1908
01:18:24.921 --> 01:18:28.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white working class who are,</v>

1909
01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who will rightly worried about the </v>

1910
01:18:30.121 --> 01:18:32.310
<v Speaker 2>direction of the company that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country is taking</v>

1911
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:33.143
<v Speaker 1>the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See soon it'll be a company that was </v>

1912
01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.720
<v Speaker 1>looking for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took an hour,</v>

1913
01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:43.920
<v Speaker 1>but you see fascism comes with a smile </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bleach blonde hair.</v>

1914
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start calling it the firm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to fix the phone.</v>

1915
01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Basically you're saying that</v>

1916
01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:53.340
<v Speaker 2>these two groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the queen calls a royal family,</v>

1917
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.220
<v Speaker 2>the firm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in England,</v>

1918
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:56.950
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these two groups coming together,</v>

1919
01:18:56.951 --> 01:18:58.450
<v Speaker 1>it will just have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1920
01:18:58.451 --> 01:19:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I feel happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joyful,</v>

1921
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:01.183
<v Speaker 2>wonderful people and I love them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both of these groups in my </v>

1922
01:19:04.611 --> 01:19:05.444
<v Speaker 2>natural constituency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of these groups in my readers and </v>

1923
01:19:07.071 --> 01:19:08.390
<v Speaker 2>my viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of these groups,</v>

1924
01:19:08.391 --> 01:19:12.200
<v Speaker 2>I think hold with them united under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under Daddy,</v>

1925
01:19:12.201 --> 01:19:15.060
<v Speaker 2>the promise of a better America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say that with no hint of,</v>

1926
01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.300
<v Speaker 2>of exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think these,</v>

1927
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:18.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these groups,</v>

1928
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.330
<v Speaker 2>think about the Gamer Gate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1929
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:21.680
<v Speaker 2>saying when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1930
01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video game players the least likely kind</v>

1931
01:19:24.961 --> 01:19:25.794
<v Speaker 2>of group in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world to rise up and beat the </v>

1932
01:19:27.321 --> 01:19:28.154
<v Speaker 2>feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did beat the feminist and they </v>

1933
01:19:28.801 --> 01:19:29.451
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1934
01:19:29.451 --> 01:19:30.100
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1935
01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.320
<v Speaker 2>everyone was thinking these parents' </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement guys and video games really?</v>

1936
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:34.760
<v Speaker 2>And they won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did what?</v>

1937
01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of the rest of us had done.</v>

1938
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they woke this thing that I did not know</v>

1939
01:19:38.391 --> 01:19:41.240
<v Speaker 2>that this was happening as a direct sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1940
01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:42.123
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tributary to enter intergeneration </v>

1941
01:19:45.051 --> 01:19:46.110
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1942
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1943
01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:49.940
<v Speaker 2>and they work people up to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you turn around as a progressive left</v>

1944
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.250
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sexist,</v>

1945
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:53.750
<v Speaker 2>go fuck yourself.</v>

1946
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Nothing bad happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

1947
01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:58.910
<v Speaker 2>other people around you start to notice </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they start to do it too.</v>

1948
01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:02.480
<v Speaker 2>And these two groups together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white working class,</v>

1949
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:03.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1950
01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:04.543
<v Speaker 2>ordinary people who've seen wages </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed and worried about where the </v>

1951
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:10.750
<v Speaker 2>country is going and that very highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1952
01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.593
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sort of highly education college </v>

1953
01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:17.190
<v Speaker 2>student and into their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to about 35 kind of cross like gen x,</v>

1954
01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:18.024
<v Speaker 2>millennial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>borderline people our age who are sick </v>

1955
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:26.040
<v Speaker 2>of having been told what to do for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years by the aggressive regressive left.</v>

1956
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:30.530
<v Speaker 2>This union of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the what I call generation trump is,</v>

1957
01:20:30.531 --> 01:20:33.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the most exciting cultural force that</v>

1958
01:20:33.141 --> 01:20:35.850
<v Speaker 2>has been in this country for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1959
01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:36.983
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a group of people that I'm very </v>

1960
01:20:38.641 --> 01:20:39.474
<v Speaker 2>proud to be part of them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a role in because I think </v>

1961
01:20:43.081 --> 01:20:44.100
<v Speaker 2>they're great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1962
01:20:44.101 --> 01:20:47.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think many of these people,</v>

1963
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.060
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the gamers in that top end </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>

1964
01:20:51.061 --> 01:20:52.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who just,</v>

1965
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.060
<v Speaker 2>people just drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive trucks for a living,</v>

1966
01:20:54.061 --> 01:20:54.360
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1967
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.193
<v Speaker 2>These are some of the people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been lied to and lied about the most in </v>

1968
01:20:57.931 --> 01:20:58.764
<v Speaker 2>American Society for decades and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>sick of it and they're right to be sick </v>

1969
01:21:01.651 --> 01:21:02.350
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1970
01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:03.900
<v Speaker 2>and if they can drive into the White </v>
<v Speaker 2>House,</v>

1971
01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:06.560
<v Speaker 2>a candidate like trump who is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build a wall,</v>

1972
01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:09.030
<v Speaker 2>he's going to fix trade is going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

1973
01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.610
<v Speaker 2>And then if he doesn't do too much else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not such a disaster.</v>

1974
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:12.833
<v Speaker 2>I'm a candidate like trump who is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to give the president establishment </v>

1975
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:18.083
<v Speaker 2>journalists and politicians are like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most colossal bloody nose and they </v>

1976
01:21:21.691 --> 01:21:23.280
<v Speaker 2>deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have it coming,</v>

1977
01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:25.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really deserve this.</v>

1978
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Then I am fully behind it.</v>

1979
01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ironically,</v>

1980
01:21:28.041 --> 01:21:28.874
<v Speaker 1>I think at that point you could make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong case that if Bernie does not get </v>

1981
01:21:32.631 --> 01:21:33.464
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic nomination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he should actually have a good </v>

1982
01:21:34.971 --> 01:21:35.804
<v Speaker 1>portion of his people should actually go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to trump because he's knows whether you </v>

1983
01:21:38.421 --> 01:21:40.890
<v Speaker 1>agree with Bernie or Hillary.</v>

1984
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you're going to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nomination.</v>

1985
01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:44.123
<v Speaker 2>But the good thing about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good thing that one of the things about </v>

1986
01:21:47.851 --> 01:21:48.684
<v Speaker 2>Saunas and trump supporters is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively politically promiscuous that </v>

1987
01:21:51.751 --> 01:21:56.130
<v Speaker 2>they want is to hurt the bad guys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad guys now the New York Times,</v>

1988
01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political class,</v>

1989
01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.091
<v Speaker 2>the banks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1990
01:22:00.091 --> 01:22:01.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people that um,</v>

1991
01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:02.673
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1992
01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.480
<v Speaker 2>controlling the rest of us and knowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>our own it not in our interests.</v>

1993
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.863
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think many of them will come over and </v>

1994
01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:10.884
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd be surprised just how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>come over because their concerns aren't </v>

1995
01:22:13.621 --> 01:22:15.410
<v Speaker 2>that different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at,</v>

1996
01:22:15.411 --> 01:22:18.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at like the saunders rallies</v>

1997
01:22:18.661 --> 01:22:21.480
<v Speaker 2>and look at the trump rallies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this similar sort of,</v>

1998
01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:22.403
<v Speaker 2>there's a sort of fun young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting kind of atmosphere in both the </v>

1999
01:22:28.381 --> 01:22:30.120
<v Speaker 2>crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a very similar feel to them.</v>

2000
01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.253
<v Speaker 2>The atmosphere at those events is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways very similar and I think </v>

2001
01:22:35.371 --> 01:22:36.204
<v Speaker 2>people are more interested in the sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of cultural ties across political lines </v>

2002
01:22:39.481 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 2>these days than they are with Republican</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Democrat labels.</v>

2003
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2004
01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 1>So those cultural ties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what brought us together.</v>

2005
01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:50.250
<v Speaker 1>So I guess to wrap all this thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the left,</v>

2006
01:22:50.251 --> 01:22:51.084
<v Speaker 1>that portion of the left that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue is probably 90 percent of the </v>

2007
01:22:53.251 --> 01:22:55.830
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not 100 percent plus me and one other</v>

2008
01:22:55.831 --> 01:22:56.750
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2009
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:58.000
<v Speaker 1>but that will leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2010
01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:58.621
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

2011
01:22:58.621 --> 01:23:00.600
<v Speaker 1>So you got million libertarian before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So between.</v>

2012
01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I,</v>

2013
01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.313
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point I would basically say I'm </v>

2014
01:23:02.851 --> 01:23:05.140
<v Speaker 1>a classical liberal libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in there.</v>

2015
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually,</v>

2016
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.510
<v Speaker 3>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't like to hear it,</v>

2017
01:23:07.511 --> 01:23:09.460
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually on the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

2018
01:23:09.461 --> 01:23:11.620
<v Speaker 3>If you looked at liberal is watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2019
01:23:11.621 --> 01:23:12.700
<v Speaker 3>you did this to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2020
01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:13.534
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2021
01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:17.230
<v Speaker 3>you forced leftists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly nice,</v>

2022
01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:19.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>domesticated liberal,</v>

2023
01:23:19.781 --> 01:23:22.690
<v Speaker 3>gay man into talking about free speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the Internet.</v>

2024
01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy what happened here.</v>

2025
01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.593
<v Speaker 3>But see if they did something good </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the regressive left and the </v>

2026
01:23:30.401 --> 01:23:33.670
<v Speaker 3>authoritarians that between the power </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of the media,</v>

2027
01:23:33.671 --> 01:23:34.540
<v Speaker 3>the politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>

2028
01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.553
<v Speaker 3>they did wake this thing up and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>why me and you can sit here and do this </v>

2029
01:23:38.771 --> 01:23:41.920
<v Speaker 3>and still have a drink after and agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>and disagree and whatever.</v>

2030
01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:44.960
<v Speaker 3>And you did a good sell job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't bring me all the way but you,</v>

2031
01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:48.070
<v Speaker 3>but you lay out an interesting case and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm interested in hearing,</v>

2032
01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.233
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they did do something because </v>

2033
01:23:50.981 --> 01:23:51.814
<v Speaker 3>they all have the people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this mix now that we talk about all the </v>

2034
01:23:54.971 --> 01:23:55.421
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2035
01:23:55.421 --> 01:23:59.230
<v Speaker 3>from Rogan and Christina Hoff summers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2036
01:23:59.231 --> 01:24:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris and budget and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people all over the map have woken up.</v>

2037
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:04.503
<v Speaker 3>So that to me is the takeaway that I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel good about with this regardless of </v>

2038
01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:10.660
<v Speaker 3>who becomes president regardless of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political end of this,</v>

2039
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:12.640
<v Speaker 3>that we're here and we're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what,</v>

2040
01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.770
<v Speaker 3>that's what the authoritarians on either</v>
<v Speaker 3>side fear the most.</v>

2041
01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:15.770
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>

2042
01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:19.060
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's an extra bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is irresistible.</v>

2043
01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:20.043
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the emergence of political correctness </v>

2044
01:24:22.181 --> 01:24:23.014
<v Speaker 3>in the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was beaten back very successfully </v>

2045
01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:28.000
<v Speaker 3>by coalition like us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're the ones doing it now.</v>

2046
01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:31.570
<v Speaker 3>And although in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people,</v>

2047
01:24:31.571 --> 01:24:32.404
<v Speaker 3>as Christine Alexis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the assistant professorships and </v>

2048
01:24:33.971 --> 01:24:34.804
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stayed in tenure and the and the </v>

2049
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:36.283
<v Speaker 3>universities and all the rest of it had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go away from the media but never </v>

2050
01:24:40.481 --> 01:24:41.314
<v Speaker 3>really went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just sort of consolidated their </v>

2051
01:24:42.971 --> 01:24:45.190
<v Speaker 3>power and returned as social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>warriors.</v>

2052
01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:48.720
<v Speaker 3>This time there's so much more on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>line for them because if it,</v>

2053
01:24:48.721 --> 01:24:51.610
<v Speaker 3>if they break this time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all breaking.</v>

2054
01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:54.940
<v Speaker 3>They all losing with the full support of</v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians,</v>

2055
01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:57.100
<v Speaker 3>the media and academia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>

2056
01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:57.993
<v Speaker 3>if people rise up now and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this social justice thing is language </v>

2057
01:25:01.421 --> 01:25:02.650
<v Speaker 3>policing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this political correctness,</v>

2058
01:25:02.651 --> 01:25:05.200
<v Speaker 3>safe spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trigger warnings and microaggressions,</v>

2059
01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:06.034
<v Speaker 3>this stuff is horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if enough people smash it </v>

2060
01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:12.910
<v Speaker 3>stranglehold on the public square,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will never recover.</v>

2061
01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:14.283
<v Speaker 3>It will never go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never come back in a like this again </v>

2062
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:19.330
<v Speaker 3>because it will lose at the height of </v>
<v Speaker 3>its powers.</v>

2063
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:21.670
<v Speaker 3>It will lose in its strongest possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>form.</v>

2064
01:25:21.671 --> 01:25:22.910
<v Speaker 3>It will lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we say in,</v>

2065
01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:24.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Internet,</v>

2066
01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:25.023
<v Speaker 3>in its final form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social justice cannot get any stronger </v>

2067
01:25:27.131 --> 01:25:27.990
<v Speaker 3>than it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2068
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:28.990
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is at,</v>

2069
01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:31.660
<v Speaker 3>it's at the peak of its powers and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>losing.</v>

2070
01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:36.550
<v Speaker 3>It's losing because people want freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to be able to do,</v>

2071
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:37.540
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

2072
01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.740
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>play and read anything and they have the</v>

2073
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:41.583
<v Speaker 3>faith in themselves and in other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they are able to make the best </v>

2074
01:25:46.181 --> 01:25:47.980
<v Speaker 3>judgments for themselves and what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in.</v>

2075
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:49.143
<v Speaker 3>They don't need to be told how to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't need to be told which books </v>

2076
01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:52.354
<v Speaker 3>to read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't need to be told which video </v>

2077
01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:54.514
<v Speaker 3>games a dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't need to be told any of these </v>

2078
01:25:56.501 --> 01:25:57.334
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't need to be instructed and </v>

2079
01:25:58.241 --> 01:25:59.074
<v Speaker 3>lectured to by politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't need to be badgered and </v>

2080
01:26:00.701 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>hectored by feminists and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to be lied to by journalists</v>

2081
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.023
<v Speaker 2>and people are sick of it and they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick of the entire mendacious edifice </v>

2082
01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:10.453
<v Speaker 2>and this is what has happening so </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderfully right now with people like </v>

2083
01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:13.034
<v Speaker 2>us and all the other conversations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are happening in cultural libertarian </v>

2084
01:26:15.231 --> 01:26:16.064
<v Speaker 2>movement and in general what I call </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation trump and data and all this </v>

<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

2087
01:26:21.621 --> 01:26:22.454
<v Speaker 2>What is behind all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heart of all of this is that </v>

2088
01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.353
<v Speaker 2>rejection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fundamental rejection of the idea </v>

2089
01:26:28.281 --> 01:26:30.830
<v Speaker 2>that somebody else knows better than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2090
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:32.330
<v Speaker 2>How I should live my life,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2113
01:27:17.291 --> 01:27:19.000

<v Speaker 2>I'll take that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he was self involved,</v>

2115
01:27:20.441 --> 01:27:22.420
<v Speaker 2>was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was spent too much money on himself,</v>

2116
01:27:22.421 --> 01:27:23.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he raised half of Rome,</v>

2117
01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.440
<v Speaker 2>a gigantic palace called the Dermis </v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

2118
01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.200

01:27:34.031 --> 01:27:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I can start live as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hated by the elites.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hated him but loved by the people.</v>
