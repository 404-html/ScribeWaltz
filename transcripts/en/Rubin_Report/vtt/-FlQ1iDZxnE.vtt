1
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>One of the occupational hazards of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a show like this is that my friends,</v>

2
00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:09.404
<v Speaker 1>my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who come up to me at the grocery </v>

3
00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:11.924
<v Speaker 1>store and at Ikea and pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone that I encounter on a day to </v>

4
00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>day basis wants to talk politics with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

5
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.893
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love talking about politics and </v>

6
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:20.084
<v Speaker 1>talking to people about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm usually happy to engage with </v>

7
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>people even when I'm picking out an ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>cream or testing out the pivot couch,</v>

8
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:29.180
<v Speaker 1>which is surprisingly comfortable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to put together.</v>

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.613
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've noticed lately </v>
<v Speaker 1>about our political climate is that </v>

10
00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 1>people are having a harder time tuning </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of politics.</v>

11
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.243
<v Speaker 1>Even briefly to talk about other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is somewhat anecdotal in my case </v>

12
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:41.684
<v Speaker 1>particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I bet that it's happening to you in </v>

13
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:44.624
<v Speaker 1>your life to suddenly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like every conversation is </v>

14
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>political.</v>

15
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Every discussion somehow gets back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump and yes,</v>

16
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>your aunt knows exactly how to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>America's healthcare crisis.</v>

17
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Even though she can't figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sync or IPAD on face value.</v>

18
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>None of this is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love.</v>

19
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:01.124
<v Speaker 1>The people who were largely apolitical </v>
<v Speaker 1>are now becoming more politically </v>

20
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:04.934
<v Speaker 1>engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are not only talking about </v>

21
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:06.944
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in many cases reevaluating what </v>

22
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>their beliefs are because of the upside </v>
<v Speaker 1>down world that we live in right now.</v>

23
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.110
<v Speaker 1>While everything may seem crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe this time that we're</v>

24
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:18.944
<v Speaker 1>in right now is a rare special moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>when so many people are all doing the </v>

25
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>same introspection about their beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>all at the same time.</v>

26
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.183
<v Speaker 1>Whether this will lead to more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom to more or less tolerance or to </v>

27
00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>more or less peace all remains to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen,</v>

28
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.153
<v Speaker 1>but without question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in some pretty fertile ground for </v>

29
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:37.244
<v Speaker 1>change right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by change I mean real societal </v>

30
00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just hoping change.</v>

31
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.573
<v Speaker 1>One problem I do see attached to all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this opportunity for change and </v>

32
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:46.994
<v Speaker 1>reevaluation is that people are becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumed by politics in a way which </v>

33
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:51.644
<v Speaker 1>doesn't strike me as particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy for humans mental state or for </v>

34
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:55.904
<v Speaker 1>societies at large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons I'm a small </v>

35
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>government guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a government small enough that we</v>

36
00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:01.304
<v Speaker 1>don't have to talk about it that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't even have the power </v>

37
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>to do too much good or too much bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a built tradeoff there.</v>

38
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Small government can only do so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest is up to the people,</v>

39
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>so if you want government to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

40
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you really can't complain when it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things that you don't like.</v>

41
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.933
<v Speaker 1>Well actually of course you can complain</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it at least until that big </v>

42
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 1>government comes and takes away your </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to do just that.</v>

43
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.960
<v Speaker 1>So my message to you this week is let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep talking about all of these issues.</v>

44
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep staying engaged and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change things for the better,</v>

45
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:38.210
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time let's not let it </v>
<v Speaker 1>consume us to the point where it changes</v>

46
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:39.044
<v Speaker 1>who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social media can be an awful catalysts </v>

47
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.194
<v Speaker 1>to the endless focus on politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I've been trying to take </v>

48
00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:45.344
<v Speaker 1>the weekends off and focus on the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists in front of my face instead </v>

49
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>of the one that exists in 140 </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

50
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.033
<v Speaker 1>When you are online though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to find some nuance between trump </v>

51
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 1>derangement syndrome and Nazi frog </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession.</v>

52
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Most people</v>

53
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 2>are good and what pretty much the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you do,</v>

54
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 2>so let's keep growing that new center </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as long as you're here right now,</v>

55
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:07.894
<v Speaker 2>we're once again partnering up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Learn Liberty this week and we've got </v>

56
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:10.984
<v Speaker 2>author and director of the philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and Economics Department at </v>

57
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Duke University,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Mike Munger.</v>

58
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>

59
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:19.414
<v Speaker 2>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and much more watch and learn unless </v>

60
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:22.324
<v Speaker 2>it's the weekend.</v>

61
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.093
<v Speaker 2>We're continuing our partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fine folks over at learn liberty </v>

62
00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:31.064
<v Speaker 2>today and joining me is an economist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>author and a professor of political </v>

63
00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:36.650
<v Speaker 2>science at Duke University.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>

64
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Mike Munger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

65
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.943
<v Speaker 2>It's great to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That introduction just makes it sound </v>

66
00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.310
<v Speaker 2>like I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably right.</v>

67
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.320
<v Speaker 2>I thought it made you sound very </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional.</v>

68
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.801
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

69
00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have several disciplines that I try to</v>

70
00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:49.470
<v Speaker 2>contribute in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.040
<v Speaker 2>What we're going to talk about those </v>
<v Speaker 2>several disciplines,</v>

72
00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:52.874
<v Speaker 2>but first let's just talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>political science because I was a </v>

73
00:03:56.091 --> 00:04:00.200
<v Speaker 2>political science major.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explains a lot of good or bad.</v>

74
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>

75
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I like to think that I'm one of the few </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that's using political,</v>

77
00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:06.554
<v Speaker 2>a political science degree actually to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about politics and political </v>

78
00:04:10.311 --> 00:04:12.800
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my first question to you would be,</v>

79
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.143
<v Speaker 2>do you think that political science </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now is sort of needed more than </v>

80
00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:18.224
<v Speaker 2>ever just to understand the basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophies behind so much of the </v>

81
00:04:21.501 --> 00:04:24.110
<v Speaker 2>craziness that we see in public </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse these days?</v>

82
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for two reasons.</v>

83
00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:27.440
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political science studies engineering,</v>

84
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.333
<v Speaker 2>but it studies engineering of rules and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to have this idea that what we </v>

85
00:04:33.171 --> 00:04:34.004
<v Speaker 2>need is better people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're probably not going to get better </v>

86
00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we may need is better rules.</v>

87
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.943
<v Speaker 2>The question is how to try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing political science does </v>

88
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.363
<v Speaker 2>is look at some of the ethical questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have plagued human beings for the </v>

89
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:46.544
<v Speaker 2>last 3000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I see political science as being a </v>

90
00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:54.200
<v Speaker 2>kind of ideal liberal arts degree that </v>
<v Speaker 2>combines an analysis and ethics,</v>

91
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.640
<v Speaker 2>but so of course I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

92
00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:57.474
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a political science professor that </v>

93
00:04:58.761 --> 00:04:59.594
<v Speaker 2>we need more political science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really do worry that people just </v>

94
00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:03.291
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

95
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.124
<v Speaker 2>we can ignore the constitution of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>living constitution will change it to </v>

96
00:05:07.851 --> 00:05:08.684
<v Speaker 2>interpret it the way that we want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand enough about rules </v>

97
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.900
<v Speaker 2>to be able just to change it willy nilly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have it turned out well.</v>

98
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 2>So I like what you said there about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.463
<v Speaker 2>that we can't change people that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people seem to think that </v>

100
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 2>that's what politics should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

101
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.223
<v Speaker 2>We should actually change the way your </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions are about very personally held </v>

102
00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:31.730
<v Speaker 2>things through public college or choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>the new Messiah.</v>

103
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Every time Barack Obama was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the new messiah.</v>

104
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.380
<v Speaker 2>He got a Nobel peace prize after he'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>been in office for seven months.</v>

105
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:40.723
<v Speaker 2>So the emphasis on this next person's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be the one and you see it </v>

106
00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:45.074
<v Speaker 2>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a little surprising to see the </v>

107
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:48.710
<v Speaker 2>u s that come to it also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 2>So as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

109
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.640
<v Speaker 2>you do consider yourself a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

110
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:53.474
<v Speaker 2>You ran as a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get to that and I am </v>

111
00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 2>certainly a libertarian and in the that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not a Republican.</v>

112
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.593
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want to unpack the differences </v>

113
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 2>between that and talk about sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ever changing label thing,</v>

114
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of becoming meaningless at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>

115
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.693
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so with all the political philosophies </v>

116
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.313
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you sense that some of the freedom </v>

117
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 2>stuff is taking root right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think to me,</v>

118
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 2>things are going crazy right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I sense that liberty reason,</v>

119
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 2>getting back to some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutional stuff,</v>

120
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:25.004
<v Speaker 2>I do sense people talking about it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more now than perhaps two </v>

121
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

122
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.653
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch of colleagues who after </v>

123
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:32.384
<v Speaker 2>trump was elected or colleagues at Duke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so political science professors and </v>

124
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 2>other people on the left who would come </v>
<v Speaker 2>into my office and sheepishly say,</v>

125
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were right.</v>

126
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.523
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff about we need to worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the constitutional powers of the </v>

127
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When George W Bush was president,</v>

128
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 2>they were worried with Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

129
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't mind so much as long as my guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in charge.</v>

130
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy Won't always be in charge,</v>

131
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 2>so what you might want best is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictator that you can pick.</v>

132
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not how it works.</v>

133
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 2>That means that we have to have rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's very frustrating.</v>

134
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.303
<v Speaker 2>The constitution builds in conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Barack Obama in many ways was a </v>

135
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 2>terrible president in trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiate things with the congress.</v>

136
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.610
<v Speaker 2>He would prefer to go make speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He liked that Messiah thing.</v>

137
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.773
<v Speaker 2>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that a lot of people on the </v>

138
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:23.384
<v Speaker 2>left are much more worried now about </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of traditional constitutional </v>

139
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 2>protections of freedom of speech and </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the separation of powers.</v>

140
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 2>So the number of them have actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

141
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:34.784
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those federalists papers really </v>

142
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:37.760
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't they?</v>

143
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome back.</v>

144
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when George W dot Bush was signing </v>

145
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 2>executive actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume you were basically against them</v>

146
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 2>when when Barack Obama was signing my </v>
<v Speaker 2>assume you were basically against them.</v>

147
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:48.824
<v Speaker 2>I assume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume you're not thrilled right now </v>

148
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 2>with the amount that that trump has </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

149
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 2>But that's really interesting to me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>your colleagues on the left are suddenly</v>

150
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:56.061
<v Speaker 2>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

151
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 2>now I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

152
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:57.884
<v Speaker 2>we have people on the left now fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>for states' rights because they don't </v>

153
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 2>want the feds coming in and closing </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctuary cities,</v>

154
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:03.734
<v Speaker 2>which I think is what a phenomenal flip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't help but gleefully reminding </v>

155
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:07.401
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

156
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:08.234
<v Speaker 2>you told me that was code for racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you're for state's rights </v>

157
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 2>because you're worried about medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>

158
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 2>You worried about same sex marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>states' rights.</v>

159
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was misused by advocates of segregation.</v>

160
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 2>That's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler was a vegetarian.</v>

161
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.150
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that all vegetarians are</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis.</v>

162
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that all state's rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are racists.</v>

163
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.423
<v Speaker 2>States' rights is an important part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>federalism and it means that we can </v>

164
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:35.264
<v Speaker 2>accomplish some things in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have this conversation all the </v>

165
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

166
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.273
<v Speaker 2>On the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also privately because I'm a big </v>

167
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:42.224
<v Speaker 2>states' rights guy and and what people </v>
<v Speaker 2>will say to me sometimes even just the </v>

168
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 2>conversation that is happening this </v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend,</v>

169
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.120
<v Speaker 2>someone was saying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

170
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I just don't trust that the states will </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the right thing,</v>

171
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:51.674
<v Speaker 2>that the southern states will do all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these backwards social things or all </v>

172
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now had many people on here,</v>

173
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 2>including a Randy Barnett who I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're familiar with.</v>

174
00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.124
<v Speaker 2>You talked about the foot vote and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you should leave states and take your </v>

175
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:02.454
<v Speaker 2>economic value and your personal value </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your family and move somewhere else </v>

176
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:06.880
<v Speaker 2>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's wonderful.</v>

177
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 2>And your ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the beauty of America.</v>

178
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's a sound enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument for states' rights?</v>

179
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

180
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 2>that you can just pick up and go it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has,</v>

181
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 2>it helps a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a while to do that.</v>

182
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:20.643
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I would argue for the way that </v>

183
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:28.311
<v Speaker 2>we've elaborated states' rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is we take the first 10 amendments</v>

184
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:30.180
<v Speaker 2>to the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bill of rights,</v>

185
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 2>and we apply those also to state laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>through incorporation,</v>

186
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:35.244
<v Speaker 2>through the 14th amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are limits on what the states </v>

187
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:38.760
<v Speaker 2>can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other than that,</v>

188
00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:39.594
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the states can have all sorts of </v>

189
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:41.184
<v Speaker 2>different things and the ninth and 10th </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendments both reserved a bunch of </v>

190
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:45.624
<v Speaker 2>powers to the states and that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the expansion through the commerce </v>

191
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 2>clause and we really sort of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>down into the weeds,</v>

192
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:52.734
<v Speaker 2>but the expansion of federal powers at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the expense of the states has been one </v>

193
00:09:56.491 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 2>of the catastrophes in constitutional </v>
<v Speaker 2>jurisprudence,</v>

194
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 2>and I hope we'll go back in the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>

195
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:02.933
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't seem like that president </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's appointments seemed to be more </v>

196
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Speaker 2>like a 10th amendment skeptics.</v>

197
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.791
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

198
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 2>even just in the last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

199
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:10.854
<v Speaker 2>there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little confusing what the truth </v>

200
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it sounds like sessions may go after</v>

201
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:14.574
<v Speaker 2>the states because of medical marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the things that I just simply </v>

202
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:18.444
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the Republicans or conservatives or </v>

203
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 2>the trump people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is,</v>

204
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you want to take a stand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

205
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.030
<v Speaker 2>That would make some logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistency.</v>

206
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 2>You get decent liberals to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

207
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 2>you're doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

208
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:32.064
<v Speaker 2>because that would mean that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be operating on principle and not </v>

209
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:35.604
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess I had hoped and I'm now </v>

210
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:41.010
<v Speaker 2>disappointed that our republican friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>have not done that.</v>

211
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.620
<v Speaker 2>All they've done is what they decry it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in others,</v>

212
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.230
<v Speaker 2>when Obama was president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

213
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:47.064
<v Speaker 2>now we're in power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll do all this stuff that we rightly </v>

214
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:52.770
<v Speaker 2>criticized Obama for doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that you have no principal at</v>

215
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:53.010
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

216
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.500
<v Speaker 2>What does that tell you about power in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general like that?</v>

217
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:56.334
<v Speaker 2>The second day get this and it's still a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little unclear to me what sessions is </v>

218
00:10:58.741 --> 00:10:59.574
<v Speaker 2>doing about the medical marijuana thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if he was to do anything other than </v>

219
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 2>respect states' rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shows me that once you have power,</v>

220
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:08.830
<v Speaker 2>you just some more power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>

221
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.183
<v Speaker 2>It isn't inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There used to be a norm of deference to </v>

222
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:17.991
<v Speaker 2>the constitution and to some extent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>forbearance or toleration,</v>

223
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.273
<v Speaker 2>so you know I'm Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly I think that that's the correct </v>

224
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.370
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All others are mistaken.</v>

225
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I also think that you get to want </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you get to believe whatever you</v>

226
00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:31.210
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>

227
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.073
<v Speaker 2>that second norm of toleration that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>being wiped away and we're going to end </v>

228
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 2>up just being a bunch of competing </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest groups,</v>

229
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think it's inevitable that </v>
<v Speaker 2>power is so seductive,</v>

230
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 2>but there if if other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like standing in line.</v>

231
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.383
<v Speaker 2>If a bunch of us come up to something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's more of us than can get </v>

232
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:50.160
<v Speaker 2>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just automatically stand in line,</v>

233
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 2>but if somebody cuts in line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say you can't do that.</v>

234
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 2>What if a bunch of people cuts in line </v>
<v Speaker 2>the line breaks,</v>

235
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.200
<v Speaker 2>so our are the norm of toleration that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we actually require that this sense that</v>

236
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 2>it's wrong to do this just because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

237
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.103
<v Speaker 2>Even though I have the power that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking down and I don't think that </v>

238
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.600
<v Speaker 2>institution can easily be rebuilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

239
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that breaking down in sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>every facet of public life right now?</v>

240
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:16.084
<v Speaker 2>Like for a moment before we started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about the media and it </v>

241
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 2>seems that mainstream media and norms </v>
<v Speaker 2>are crumbling and we have activists,</v>

242
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 2>activists that are now masquerading as </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist.</v>

243
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.880
<v Speaker 2>This is a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

244
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.863
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time in a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different professions that were sort of </v>

245
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:32.134
<v Speaker 2>guild rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is I have to act as a professional </v>

246
00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:36.064
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I will lose the respect of my </v>

247
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:42.361
<v Speaker 2>colleagues and that respect comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things the right way.</v>

248
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Not taking positions that are correct </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the liberal or Conservative</v>

249
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 2>catechism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's doing things the right way.</v>

250
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:51.680
<v Speaker 2>It's actually doing real reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

251
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.970
<v Speaker 2>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides are substituting what Stephen</v>

252
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Colbert called truthiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is there's an essential truth that</v>

253
00:12:58.871 --> 00:12:59.704
<v Speaker 2>exist irrespective of the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the facts are not evidence there </v>

254
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.970
<v Speaker 2>examples that makes a world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>

255
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.610
<v Speaker 2>You're coralling with my examples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have other ones.</v>

256
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

257
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 2>if you say something that's not a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means you're not a professional.</v>

258
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 2>You should be embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're losing.</v>

259
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:16.114
<v Speaker 2>Is those norms of professionalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think that started or when </v>

260
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:20.704
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's fair to the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous incident was dan rather and some </v>

261
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:27.454
<v Speaker 2>producers at CBS with the letters from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Alabama national guard about George </v>

262
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.403
<v Speaker 2>W dot Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the letters were provided by </v>

263
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:38.170
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he'd found them in some files,</v>

264
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.453
<v Speaker 2>but when you looked at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty clear that they couldn't </v>

265
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:44.490
<v Speaker 2>have been done on an IBM selectric </v>
<v Speaker 2>typewriter there,</v>

266
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Speaker 2>proportional font.</v>

267
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 2>They had the wrong size footnotes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they should've backed off.</v>

268
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:51.880
<v Speaker 2>They don't made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't.</v>

269
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.310
<v Speaker 2>They doubled down and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

270
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:59.020
<v Speaker 2>but there's an essential truth here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what happened was,</v>

271
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 2>and this is the origin of the pajamas </v>
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>

272
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.033
<v Speaker 2>the CBS producers said something you </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought was true that turned out to be </v>

273
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:08.680
<v Speaker 2>true in a way he didn't expect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

274
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:09.514
<v Speaker 2>who are you going to believe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>CBS News or some guy in his basement </v>

275
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.690
<v Speaker 2>wearing pajamas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

276
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:14.524
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that the guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement wearing pajamas is pretty good </v>

277
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 2>at fact checking and so that it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>start there,</v>

278
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.410
<v Speaker 2>but that was a catalyzing moment where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people said,</v>

279
00:14:24.411 --> 00:14:25.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CBS News,</v>

280
00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Edward r Murrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is as,</v>

281
00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:28.843
<v Speaker 2>as professional was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets and they substituted their own </v>

282
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:35.140
<v Speaker 2>ideological judgment for any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>concern about facts.</v>

283
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 2>The guy in the basement seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting more powerful these days.</v>

284
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you view that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a net good.</v>

285
00:14:41.471 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 2>The powers asymmetric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we cannot discover truth.</v>

286
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:45.994
<v Speaker 2>What we can do is impeach false hood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the guy in the basement is pretty </v>

287
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:51.124
<v Speaker 2>good at checking and seeing if there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something contradictory to a claim that </v>

288
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:54.854
<v Speaker 2>you've made and what that means is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one can believe anything now because </v>

289
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:02.570
<v Speaker 2>there's always someone who's checking on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and saying maybe making this up.</v>

290
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

291
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.333
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

292
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a quote in a tweet and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a link and they just assert something</v>

293
00:15:08.551 --> 00:15:11.220
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

294
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.720
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a terrible,</v>

295
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.923
<v Speaker 2>a terrible problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then how do you as as a political </v>

296
00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:20.690
<v Speaker 2>science professor at someone that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to frame this for young minds,</v>

297
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.793
<v Speaker 2>how do you give them something that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't walk out of your class at the end </v>

298
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:25.160
<v Speaker 2>of the semester and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

299
00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're screwed.</v>

300
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.463
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how you eventually fix </v>

301
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:29.953
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

302
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.053
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them to walk out of class saying </v>

303
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.613
<v Speaker 2>we could be screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have an obligation to try to act </v>

304
00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:36.944
<v Speaker 2>against this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of those obligations is to do </v>

305
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:41.930
<v Speaker 2>the right thing even when it's not in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our self interest.</v>

306
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.690
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

307
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:44.683
<v Speaker 2>one of my students from a while back </v>
<v Speaker 2>from duke is a guy named Brendan Nyhan </v>

308
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.440
<v Speaker 2>at Dartmouth College who writes a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this sort of problem.</v>

309
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.260
<v Speaker 2>And so I think if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if readers are interested,</v>

310
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:58.094
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Brendan Lyons work on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this question of I think there is some </v>

311
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:02.654
<v Speaker 2>hope in this direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's gonna we're gonna have to </v>

312
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:08.060
<v Speaker 2>enlist the aid of more of the mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>

313
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.260
<v Speaker 2>And the problem that you have is you may</v>
<v Speaker 2>just lose.</v>

314
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:13.400
<v Speaker 2>The ratings were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

315
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 2>if you're not interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>provocative is,</v>

316
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.420
<v Speaker 2>have we already crossed that point?</v>

317
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.373
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that the election got us </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sort of parody between the online </v>

318
00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:22.964
<v Speaker 2>media and the mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like that night it sort of became </v>

319
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:28.670
<v Speaker 2>equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now at this point I think the online</v>

320
00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:33.671
<v Speaker 2>media actually has more influence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of why the click style and,</v>

321
00:16:34.991 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 2>and some of the stuff that we've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>with CNN over the last couple of weeks.</v>

322
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.990
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's gotten crazier because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

323
00:16:39.991 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 2>They're just grasping for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the last bit of relevancy,</v>

324
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.400
<v Speaker 2>let's put a more hopeful spin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

325
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.273
<v Speaker 2>it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember we talked about states rights </v>

326
00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:51.440
<v Speaker 2>were misused by segregationists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

327
00:16:51.441 --> 00:16:52.274
<v Speaker 2>it's true that some of the power for </v>
<v Speaker 2>curation of the mainstream media was </v>

328
00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:58.550
<v Speaker 2>misused and when we no longer trust </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

329
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's much easier now to produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>content and I it self serving,</v>

330
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:04.094
<v Speaker 2>but your show is a sign that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually willing to spend more than </v>

331
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:11.960
<v Speaker 2>three or four minutes or 140 characters </v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to understand things.</v>

332
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.770
<v Speaker 2>So there is this desire to know if not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>

333
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.800
<v Speaker 2>at least the nuance of the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>claims and the ability to leap frog.</v>

334
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.510
<v Speaker 2>You can just put something up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube,</v>

335
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.080
<v Speaker 2>you get subscribers and to some extent </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to determine something like</v>

336
00:17:29.511 --> 00:17:30.344
<v Speaker 2>ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have to go through these </v>

337
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:33.524
<v Speaker 2>institutions that until now have meant </v>
<v Speaker 2>that only a relative few people could </v>

338
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:40.790
<v Speaker 2>participate in the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you fear the wild west factor?</v>

339
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.400
<v Speaker 2>The I do the best job I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people sometimes say to me,</v>

340
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the only person I trust,</v>

341
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:45.300
<v Speaker 2>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

342
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.133
<v Speaker 2>this is a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm I'm doing the best that I can truly </v>

343
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.260
<v Speaker 2>ready to transition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

344
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.480
<v Speaker 2>and the wild west actually wasn't that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad in a way.</v>

345
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.490
<v Speaker 2>There's a book by Terry Anderson and PJ </v>
<v Speaker 2>hill called the knots of wild wild west.</v>

346
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.693
<v Speaker 2>If they talk about the California gold </v>
<v Speaker 2>fields and the fact that people came up </v>

347
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 2>with ways of allocating property rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and adjudicating disputes,</v>

348
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.060
<v Speaker 2>so for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

349
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:10.920
<v Speaker 2>it was bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people realized,</v>

350
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sucks.</v>

351
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.330
<v Speaker 2>We can do better than this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they organize themselves.</v>

352
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 2>So I think within five years we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look back on this.</v>

353
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Time is a time of transition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not as a time of catastrophe.</v>

354
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.883
<v Speaker 2>New institutions are going to emerge </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the ability to curate and </v>

355
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:26.934
<v Speaker 2>provide news that people can rely on as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much fun as it is just always to be </v>

356
00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:31.134
<v Speaker 2>outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to come up with new </v>

357
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:35.430
<v Speaker 2>institutions because the stakes are too </v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

358
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hope we do.</v>

359
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:38.124
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as someone that's an outsider for that </v>

360
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 2>crumbling thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think it should crumble,</v>

361
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:42.654
<v Speaker 2>I do want some new institutions to exist</v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise we're just going to </v>

362
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 2>filter ourselves into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into total distance from each other.</v>

363
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.550
<v Speaker 2>We're in a way the the catastrophe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the trump administration,</v>

364
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.263
<v Speaker 2>it means that a whole lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens that the editor for the </v>

365
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 2>weekly standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Crystal is a friend of mine.</v>

366
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.770
<v Speaker 2>His daughter went to Duke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a fan of trump.</v>

367
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Not really a fan of trump in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism.</v>

368
00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 2>That should be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a Republican Congress,</v>

369
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Republican president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's saying no principals.</v>

370
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Speaker 2>More important than power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for a libertarian,</v>

371
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.950
<v Speaker 2>and obviously you can bill is not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians but he's not.</v>

372
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 2>He's not a libertarian but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for a libertarian,</v>

373
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.800
<v Speaker 2>do you do think trump has been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster?</v>

374
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.873
<v Speaker 2>Because I can see arguments that make </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense libertarian wise in terms of </v>

375
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.960
<v Speaker 2>some of the state stuff and some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes,</v>

376
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.843
<v Speaker 2>stuff that kind of makes sense on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional libertarian or even </v>

377
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:38.964
<v Speaker 2>conservative side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then some of the bigger government </v>

378
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:41.394
<v Speaker 2>things that don't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think jeff session is the worst </v>

379
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:46.110
<v Speaker 2>presidential appointment of my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

380
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 2>He's a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that alone,</v>

381
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:53.280
<v Speaker 2>the sort of the no state's rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no fourth amendment.</v>

382
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Jeff sessions is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

383
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.173
<v Speaker 2>I have some friends including Walter </v>
<v Speaker 2>Block at Loyola University in New </v>

384
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Orleans who is hoping that trump will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>something good on foreign policy.</v>

385
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.130
<v Speaker 2>I think you could make that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that.</v>

386
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:12.983
<v Speaker 2>I think trump's inability even to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider rule of law and the </v>

387
00:20:17.491 --> 00:20:19.650
<v Speaker 2>constitutional restrictions on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidency.</v>

388
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:20.993
<v Speaker 2>It make even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The slide that we've been in for an </v>

389
00:20:25.681 --> 00:20:27.960
<v Speaker 2>expansion of an imperial presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

390
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.833
<v Speaker 2>I worry that all of those bonds are now </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be broken and we're going to </v>

391
00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:34.260
<v Speaker 2>look for the big man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Messiah,</v>

392
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.100
<v Speaker 2>and we're just going to trade back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth between different visions of that.</v>

393
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.810
<v Speaker 2>And that can never work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

394
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:40.644
<v Speaker 2>and that goes exactly to where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>started this conversation about looking </v>

395
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:43.644
<v Speaker 2>for that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that our institutions are </v>

396
00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:46.680
<v Speaker 2>actually strong enough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

397
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.533
<v Speaker 2>I'm believer that these institutions </v>
<v Speaker 2>still have enough power that if trump </v>

398
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:55.090
<v Speaker 2>was to do something truly illegal or </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly overstepping executive authority,</v>

399
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.460
<v Speaker 2>but even though the Republicans Control </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress,</v>

400
00:20:57.461 --> 00:20:58.294
<v Speaker 2>that there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we still have enough juice left in </v>

401
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:02.230
<v Speaker 2>the system to take care of that.</v>

402
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 2>So that I think would sort of mitigate </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of my fears about him for sure.</v>

403
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The system is pretty strong in a way.</v>

404
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:10.144
<v Speaker 2>So James Madison in federalist 51 said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the structure of the government </v>

405
00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Speaker 2>should be such that ambition is made to </v>
<v Speaker 2>counteract ambition.</v>

406
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.330
<v Speaker 2>So you can be Republican member of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Senate,</v>

407
00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:21.340
<v Speaker 2>but you look in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see your God,</v>

408
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a bad ass.</v>

409
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:29.260
<v Speaker 2>I have the power of the Senate here or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the president is trying to use executive</v>

410
00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:30.094
<v Speaker 2>orders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that much because it makes </v>

411
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:36.931
<v Speaker 2>me less powerful as a senator and so a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people in the Senate,</v>

412
00:21:37.841 --> 00:21:42.841
<v Speaker 2>I think we'll use madison's ambition </v>
<v Speaker 2>must be made to counteract ambition,</v>

413
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.990
<v Speaker 2>insight to limit trump at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.660
<v Speaker 2>So as a guy that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell,</v>

415
00:21:49.661 --> 00:21:54.661
<v Speaker 2>obviously you're not a big trump fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still trust in the system.</v>

416
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.313
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of when you hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like maxine waters constantly </v>

417
00:21:58.721 --> 00:21:59.554
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to figure out a way to </v>

418
00:22:00.221 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 2>impeach him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

419
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 2>like we don't know what it is yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to get there.</v>

420
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:04.323
<v Speaker 2>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is almost more undermining of the </v>

421
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:07.474
<v Speaker 2>system than the excesses that trump may </v>
<v Speaker 2>or may not have or may or may not be </v>

422
00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:12.904
<v Speaker 2>doing at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with everything you said except </v>

423
00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:16.080
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh alright.</v>

424
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:16.983
<v Speaker 2>It is more undermining of the system so </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a parliamentary system </v>

425
00:22:20.471 --> 00:22:21.304
<v Speaker 2>where a vote of no confidence is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes high crimes and misdemeanors </v>

426
00:22:24.431 --> 00:22:29.200
<v Speaker 2>and I was actually proud of the American</v>
<v Speaker 2>system in 1998 were for no good reason.</v>

427
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:30.034
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of problems with Bill </v>

428
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was impeached and the sentence of</v>

429
00:22:33.571 --> 00:22:35.290
<v Speaker 2>this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

430
00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:37.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that that would happen again.</v>

431
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:37.863
<v Speaker 2>There's the Democrats were very upset </v>
<v Speaker 2>when there was a movement among </v>

432
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Republicans to say we should impeach a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barack Obama.</v>

433
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 2>So I think that this may just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>background and the,</v>

434
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.323
<v Speaker 2>the nice way to interpret it is it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way for Democrats to raise money from </v>

435
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:57.460
<v Speaker 2>their base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't actually mean it,</v>

436
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 2>but it's just red meat out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

437
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Which is also pretty horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just saying it.</v>

438
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:05.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Means that you're undermining the rule </v>

439
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:08.494
<v Speaker 2>of law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're actually doing what you say </v>

440
00:23:11.171 --> 00:23:13.540
<v Speaker 2>you're upset at trump for doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

441
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:14.403
<v Speaker 2>So is there anyone in politics right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you look at and you go these guys </v>

442
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.780
<v Speaker 2>basically on board with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the principles that I believe in.</v>

443
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't surprise you to learn that.</v>

444
00:23:24.731 --> 00:23:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I admire Rand Paul and I actually liked </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Gary Johnson.</v>

445
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.833
<v Speaker 2>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about him for a little bit </v>

446
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:32.580
<v Speaker 2>lower.</v>

447
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Let's just talk about him within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework of libertarian politics.</v>

448
00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:36.514
<v Speaker 2>I've had him on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spend time with him about a half hour </v>

449
00:23:38.681 --> 00:23:39.514
<v Speaker 2>before we were on air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he is a totally lovely guy </v>

450
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.710
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I enjoyed talking to him and I could</v>

451
00:23:44.711 --> 00:23:49.490
<v Speaker 2>see us being friends actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the candidacy was pretty terrible.</v>

452
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 2>It was the greatest ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was three times as much as we've ever</v>

453
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:55.310
<v Speaker 2>gotten before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got three percent.</v>

454
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.523
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's enough for ballot access in many </v>

455
00:23:59.361 --> 00:24:01.370
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that might've just been</v>

456
00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 2>a function of disgust with the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

457
00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:04.004
<v Speaker 2>that sort that gary himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that unfortunately just seemed ill </v>

458
00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:06.554
<v Speaker 2>equipped to be up there and have enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a command of the issues and by the </v>

459
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:10.694
<v Speaker 2>way I say that with total sympathy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>him because there was nothing he could </v>

460
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 2>do to get in the news except flood.</v>

461
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.770
<v Speaker 2>They would only talk about it when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>floods,</v>

462
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:16.604
<v Speaker 2>so he was in an unwinnable position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is so much better than anything else </v>

463
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.590
<v Speaker 2>that we have had and I mean I'm actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>a libertarian partisan.</v>

464
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I ran for governor of North Carolina in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2008.</v>

465
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 2>I did not win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're going to get to that.</v>

466
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I campaigned with Gary Johnson.</v>

467
00:24:32.691 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to know him pretty well.</v>

468
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He flubbed that.</v>

469
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.043
<v Speaker 2>He was tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made a bunch of mistakes and that's </v>

470
00:24:38.901 --> 00:24:39.734
<v Speaker 2>what the media emphasized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really important that he got </v>

471
00:24:42.261 --> 00:24:44.660
<v Speaker 2>three percent and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were to look,</v>

472
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.330
<v Speaker 2>suppose you strip away the party labels </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're a visitor from Mars.</v>

473
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's this person who has been a </v>

474
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.720
<v Speaker 2>secretary of state and has experienced </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a senator,</v>

475
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:54.883
<v Speaker 2>and then there's these two people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were multiterm governors have pretty </v>

476
00:24:59.121 --> 00:25:03.290
<v Speaker 2>mixed states and then some psycho person</v>
<v Speaker 2>in real estate.</v>

477
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.990
<v Speaker 2>You don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

478
00:25:05.991 --> 00:25:08.240
<v Speaker 2>those are the libertarian candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I.</v>

479
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.340
<v Speaker 2>my question would be compared to what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

480
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Gary Johnson did a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

481
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:13.543
<v Speaker 2>He did the best libertarian candidate </v>
<v Speaker 2>has ever done and he gave us something </v>

482
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 2>to build on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I cringe at the Aleppo incident?</v>

483
00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

484
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In August I,</v>

485
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:24.783
<v Speaker 2>I endorsed him basically with the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>of let's get the guy to 15 percent so </v>

486
00:25:28.311 --> 00:25:29.144
<v Speaker 2>that at least for one debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we know the Democrats and </v>

487
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:32.144
<v Speaker 2>Republicans control the debates at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one debate because they'd never let </v>

488
00:25:34.831 --> 00:25:37.190
<v Speaker 2>them in in second line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least for one,</v>

489
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.090
<v Speaker 2>let's hear some of these law limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>government ideas and unfortunately there</v>

490
00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:41.924
<v Speaker 2>just wasn't enough juice there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I'm hearing you and </v>

491
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.163
<v Speaker 2>maybe I will ease off him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little question is compared to what </v>

492
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.950
<v Speaker 2>you got three percent.</v>

493
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.040
<v Speaker 2>The best we ever did was one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

494
00:25:52.041 --> 00:25:53.990
<v Speaker 2>So then what does that mean to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the,</v>

495
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:54.824
<v Speaker 2>is the future for the Libertarian Party </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do you think that a third party </v>

496
00:25:58.851 --> 00:25:59.684
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

497
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.550
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that three percent means something to</v>

498
00:26:01.551 --> 00:26:03.800
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that that means it could be</v>

499
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 2>six percent in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20?</v>

500
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Could it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could it be really impactful in 20,</v>

501
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:11.690
<v Speaker 2>23rd parties in a system of first past </v>
<v Speaker 2>the post,</v>

502
00:26:11.691 --> 00:26:12.524
<v Speaker 2>which is what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always going to have two main </v>

503
00:26:15.711 --> 00:26:16.544
<v Speaker 2>parties in a first past the post system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the positions of the parties will </v>

504
00:26:21.561 --> 00:26:22.394
<v Speaker 2>depend partly on the pressure that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bought brought to bear and if you have </v>

505
00:26:25.371 --> 00:26:28.580
<v Speaker 2>someone who can participate in debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly at the state level,</v>

506
00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:29.414
<v Speaker 2>you can remind the two state sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties of the things that are in their </v>

507
00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:33.854
<v Speaker 2>platform that they're leaving out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think a third party is going </v>

508
00:26:36.811 --> 00:26:39.290
<v Speaker 2>to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I care about is the policies,</v>

509
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:42.470
<v Speaker 2>not the face of number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care about rules and not the people.</v>

510
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:43.763
<v Speaker 2>So if the two state sponsored parties </v>
<v Speaker 2>are obliged by opening up to the </v>

511
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.383
<v Speaker 2>scolding wins of competition and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have better policies that that's what I </v>

512
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 2>hope that the third parties can do.</v>

513
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear people on the right all the time </v>

514
00:26:55.571 --> 00:26:56.021
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

515
00:26:56.021 --> 00:26:56.854
<v Speaker 1>if we back a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you end up doing is splitting the </v>

516
00:26:59.261 --> 00:27:01.570
<v Speaker 1>vote on the right and then you help </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the left.</v>

517
00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:02.763
<v Speaker 1>How would you explain to somebody that </v>
<v Speaker 1>may not matter and maybe that has to </v>

518
00:27:06.011 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

519
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.433
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only get one vote and sometimes </v>

520
00:27:10.891 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 2>people do advocate what political </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists call voting.</v>

521
00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:18.210
<v Speaker 2>The Lote lesser of two evils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you vote for the lesser of two evils,</v>

522
00:27:18.211 --> 00:27:19.690
<v Speaker 2>you're certainly going to get an eval,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

523
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.083
<v Speaker 2>The only way to waste your vote is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote for a candidate you don't actually </v>

524
00:27:23.281 --> 00:27:26.550
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you vote for a candidate that you</v>

525
00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 2>do want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to give a signal to the two</v>

526
00:27:29.401 --> 00:27:30.234
<v Speaker 2>state sponsored parties that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>find this to be acceptable so that all </v>

527
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 2>your votes are wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't determine the outcome.</v>

528
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.063
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I get then is conservatives </v>

529
00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 2>particularly saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if everyone thought that way?</v>

530
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agenda,</v>

531
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:48.030
<v Speaker 2>you are so your vote affects thousands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of others.</v>

532
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.040
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have one vote.</v>

533
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:50.874
<v Speaker 2>You can choose to waste it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can vote what you actually </v>

534
00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:56.880
<v Speaker 2>believe and try to send a signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:58.723
<v Speaker 1>Which I think would be more important </v>
<v Speaker 1>than just throwing it away or I would </v>

536
00:28:03.141 --> 00:28:03.974
<v Speaker 1>think that there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've gotten stuck in this </v>

537
00:28:06.261 --> 00:28:09.590
<v Speaker 1>lesser of two evils as the two parties </v>
<v Speaker 1>have gotten more and more evil.</v>

538
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think part of that also is that </v>

539
00:28:12.591 --> 00:28:15.200
<v Speaker 1>the whole system now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say the system,</v>

540
00:28:15.201 --> 00:28:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean our political system and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>media system,</v>

541
00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:22.540
<v Speaker 1>there's only a certain type of person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who would run that and now we can talk a</v>

542
00:28:22.971 --> 00:28:25.070
<v Speaker 1>little bit also about your 2008 </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign,</v>

543
00:28:25.071 --> 00:28:26.600
<v Speaker 1>but that it would take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:28:26.601 --> 00:28:27.434
<v Speaker 1>the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of having to deal with what </v>

545
00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:29.354
<v Speaker 1>your family will have to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to track down every email </v>

546
00:28:32.331 --> 00:28:36.020
<v Speaker 1>that you ever had an affair or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

547
00:28:36.021 --> 00:28:36.854
<v Speaker 1>Just all of that nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're only gonna get a certain type of </v>

548
00:28:39.321 --> 00:28:41.270
<v Speaker 1>person that wants to do this and adding </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

549
00:28:41.271 --> 00:28:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good decent people will self select out.</v>

550
00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:46.034
<v Speaker 1>I hear this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I see somebody I talked to </v>

551
00:28:47.901 --> 00:28:49.760
<v Speaker 1>somebody that I think should be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

552
00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:51.620
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't want to subject myself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

553
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.600
<v Speaker 1>but many guests here that privately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said,</v>

554
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.500
<v Speaker 1>you want to run for something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

555
00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

556
00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.253
<v Speaker 2>There's really two problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the process of running is very </v>

557
00:29:02.411 --> 00:29:03.244
<v Speaker 2>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes a lot of time and you constantly </v>

558
00:29:05.981 --> 00:29:10.150
<v Speaker 2>have your motives questioned and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically very difficult.</v>

559
00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.253
<v Speaker 2>The other problem is if you win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to serve and a lot of people </v>

560
00:29:14.351 --> 00:29:17.800
<v Speaker 2>that are really good at things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at things.</v>

561
00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:22.120
<v Speaker 2>They're doing something else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to be the sort of person who</v>

562
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.333
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say too much about </v>

563
00:29:24.641 --> 00:29:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who just thinks of yourself as being</v>

564
00:29:27.881 --> 00:29:32.290
<v Speaker 2>essentially infallible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is we as voters validate</v>

565
00:29:32.291 --> 00:29:33.124
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I found often in debates and talking </v>

566
00:29:36.101 --> 00:29:36.934
<v Speaker 2>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>voters would ask a question about some </v>

567
00:29:39.281 --> 00:29:41.920
<v Speaker 2>policy and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's actually complicated.</v>

568
00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:42.754
<v Speaker 2>That's something experts disagree about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here are the two arguments and you can </v>

569
00:29:45.101 --> 00:29:48.250
<v Speaker 2>see their eyes glazing over and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponents would say,</v>

570
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly the right thing to do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>

571
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 2>And then they would say something </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

572
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:57.640
<v Speaker 2>but that wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what to do is always going to win</v>

573
00:29:57.641 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is heart.</v>

574
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is also a great argument for small</v>

575
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 2>government to admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every now and I don't know what to do,</v>

576
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:08.180
<v Speaker 2>so maybe we shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

577
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>passing just things that are going to </v>

578
00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:10.624
<v Speaker 2>completely change the system because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth is nobody knows what comes out on </v>

579
00:30:12.371 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 2>the other side and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>something is a problem doesn't mean that</v>

580
00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:17.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

581
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.000
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call that the,</v>

582
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.970
<v Speaker 2>we should do something problem x is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

583
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.560
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should do something.</v>

584
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Why is something therefore we should do </v>
<v Speaker 2>y?</v>

585
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:31.660
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't follow the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>something should be done,</v>

586
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:32.441
<v Speaker 2>but then they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

587
00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:33.274
<v Speaker 2>you don't care about x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so of unemployment and poverty are </v>

588
00:30:36.821 --> 00:30:37.654
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there are these things that we </v>

589
00:30:39.761 --> 00:30:40.320
<v Speaker 2>should do.</v>

590
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.051
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

591
00:30:41.051 --> 00:30:41.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things won't work.</v>

592
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hate pork.</v>

593
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.770
<v Speaker 2>And it's almost impossible to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to extricate yourself out of that.</v>

594
00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

595
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:54.250
<v Speaker 2>So you ran as libertarian candidate for </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor of North Carolina in 2008.</v>

596
00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:56.680
<v Speaker 2>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within a year,</v>

597
00:30:56.681 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you're a real politic person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not just run as a Republican?</v>

598
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Which would have perhaps given you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better shot,</v>

599
00:31:02.441 --> 00:31:05.920
<v Speaker 2>just just start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just in the reality of,</v>

600
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.350
<v Speaker 2>I live in North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

601
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Are Democrats or Republicans or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans or Taliban?</v>

602
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.960
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want Sharia law.</v>

603
00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Now it's Christian Sharia law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the real Christian,</v>

604
00:31:19.601 --> 00:31:20.434
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have come in eighth in a seven </v>

605
00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:25.090
<v Speaker 2>person primary if I had run as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican.</v>

606
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:30.100
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there really is no constituency in North</v>

607
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Carolina among the Republicans for my </v>
<v Speaker 2>view of conservatism.</v>

608
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.100
<v Speaker 2>But if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the Democrats or Republicans,</v>

609
00:31:36.101 --> 00:31:41.050
<v Speaker 2>why not run as a Democrat then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I considered running as a Democrat,</v>

610
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:41.913
<v Speaker 2>but the Democrats have had a machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>that controlled the state and it was </v>

611
00:31:46.781 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 2>clear who the nominee was going to be.</v>

612
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.463
<v Speaker 2>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my the reason that I ran was my </v>

613
00:31:53.651 --> 00:31:55.870
<v Speaker 2>objection to North Carolina's ballot </v>
<v Speaker 2>access laws.</v>

614
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:58.690
<v Speaker 2>We have some of the most restrictive </v>
<v Speaker 2>ballot access laws in the country.</v>

615
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.083
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if coke and Pepsi could decide on any </v>

616
00:32:01.331 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 2>soft drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be.</v>

617
00:32:02.411 --> 00:32:05.620
<v Speaker 2>They would say to the Republicans and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats actually get to do that.</v>

618
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:09.270
<v Speaker 2>And they think two is the right number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all I,</v>

619
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:09.760
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

620
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.070
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to raise about $300,000</v>

621
00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:12.904
<v Speaker 2>to get on the ballot and then we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>never get enough votes to stay on the </v>

622
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:16.144
<v Speaker 2>ballot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So eight times we'd spent all this </v>

623
00:32:17.471 --> 00:32:20.020
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this collection of signatures.</v>

624
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured that I could get two percent.</v>

625
00:32:22.631 --> 00:32:24.730
<v Speaker 2>It takes two percent to stay on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ballot.</v>

626
00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:28.000
<v Speaker 2>We'd never done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you set your goals really low,</v>

627
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:30.850
<v Speaker 2>you can be a success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got more than two percent,</v>

628
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.140
<v Speaker 2>so I figured I could do that.</v>

629
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:32.983
<v Speaker 2>An idea that was my objective is to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the two percent and I got two point </v>

630
00:32:35.651 --> 00:32:36.484
<v Speaker 2>eight percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that some of those ideas </v>

631
00:32:38.051 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 2>that you are running on 2008 have taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>root in North Carolina?</v>

632
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.523
<v Speaker 2>They were at least mentioned by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other candidates and sometimes the </v>

633
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:47.390
<v Speaker 2>newspapers would even point this out </v>
<v Speaker 2>also.</v>

634
00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:50.780
<v Speaker 2>I was in for televised debates and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some ways I'm their worst nightmare.</v>

635
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:52.123
<v Speaker 2>I have a phd in economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a certain superficial glibness and </v>

636
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:57.190
<v Speaker 2>no chance of winning so I could answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>the questions.</v>

637
00:32:57.191 --> 00:32:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't got the superficial.</v>

638
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'll come or maybe you're very </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective at it and I've,</v>

639
00:33:02.911 --> 00:33:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I've missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

640
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.533
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is the reason that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians haven't done more at the </v>

641
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:11.360
<v Speaker 2>state level?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people talk about the libertarians,</v>

642
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:12.194
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

643
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Gary Johnson or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>

644
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:16.490
<v Speaker 2>there is ramp all but technically he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>republican.</v>

645
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was Justin Amash.</v>

646
00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:19.034
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why haven't they done more just on </v>

647
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:23.480
<v Speaker 2>the local level?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This seems like a major,</v>

648
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opening for them coming over here.</v>

649
00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:28.790
<v Speaker 2>I was promising myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't gonna answer this question,</v>

650
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.653
<v Speaker 2>but what the heck go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say here's what happens at </v>

651
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:34.460
<v Speaker 2>libertarian meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first one,</v>

652
00:33:34.461 --> 00:33:35.294
<v Speaker 2>20 or 30 people show up and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic and at the second meeting </v>

653
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.980
<v Speaker 2>10 people show up and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 10 say,</v>

654
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad those others didn't come</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

655
00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:46.034
<v Speaker 2>They weren't real libertarians because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're mainly concerned about is </v>

656
00:33:49.731 --> 00:33:50.564
<v Speaker 2>checking each other's papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can tell if it's a real </v>

657
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 2>libertarian meeting by how long is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>before there's an argument about whether</v>

658
00:33:57.651 --> 00:33:59.810
<v Speaker 2>individuals should be able to own </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons.</v>

659
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cares about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was running for governor,</v>

660
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.240
<v Speaker 2>people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you end the Fed?</v>

661
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm running for governor.</v>

662
00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Actually this is not set yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to know.</v>

663
00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.213
<v Speaker 2>So what we really care about is </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological purity because if you cared </v>

664
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:15.374
<v Speaker 2>about actual policy or winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would suck it up and be a Democrat </v>

665
00:34:18.351 --> 00:34:19.184
<v Speaker 2>or Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the problem that we have as </v>

666
00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:21.824
<v Speaker 2>libertarians is that I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can see themselves as being part </v>

667
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:28.100
<v Speaker 2>of a political process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think of themselves as,</v>

668
00:34:28.450 --> 00:34:29.283
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trey as being outside and truth tellers </v>

669
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.710
<v Speaker 2>that the keepers of last flickering </v>
<v Speaker 2>remnant of truth.</v>

670
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's just not a very effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>political strategy.</v>

671
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.503
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after doing this show for about two </v>

672
00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:45.190
<v Speaker 2>years and having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

673
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.390
<v Speaker 2>a lot of classical liberals on a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians,</v>

674
00:34:47.391 --> 00:34:48.224
<v Speaker 2>and I've had progressives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and everything that to me </v>

675
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.753
<v Speaker 2>basically the difference that I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>between classical liberal and </v>

676
00:34:54.861 --> 00:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Libertarian is a little more realistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility for the state.</v>

677
00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.650
<v Speaker 2>So when someone comes in with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question and says to you,</v>

678
00:35:00.651 --> 00:35:01.484
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get rid of the Fed and </v>

679
00:35:01.701 --> 00:35:02.534
<v Speaker 2>you got running for governor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also that's a really high level </v>

680
00:35:04.281 --> 00:35:07.130
<v Speaker 2>philosophical thing that we know that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me it's just,</v>

681
00:35:07.131 --> 00:35:10.370
<v Speaker 2>it's just a more realistic approach to </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to change things.</v>

682
00:35:10.371 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's a fair assessment?</v>

683
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:12.763
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've made a distinction in a couple </v>

684
00:35:14.511 --> 00:35:15.344
<v Speaker 2>of things that I've written between </v>
<v Speaker 2>directional and destination as </v>

685
00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:18.464
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians destination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This libertarians have a particular </v>

686
00:35:20.931 --> 00:35:24.350
<v Speaker 2>liberty OPA in mind and anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not like that is out.</v>

687
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:26.143
<v Speaker 2>Analysts would want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there policies that we could choose </v>

688
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.270
<v Speaker 2>that would be cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower deficits,</v>

689
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.433
<v Speaker 2>lower the power of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and increased personal responsibility </v>

690
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:36.704
<v Speaker 2>and liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So an example would be when I was </v>

691
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 2>running for governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my educational platform was vouchers and</v>

692
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:44.800
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people means tested vouchers.</v>

693
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.820
<v Speaker 2>So the poorest 40 percent would get more</v>
<v Speaker 2>school choice.</v>

694
00:35:47.821 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Many of the wealthy habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

695
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.393
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's have more school choice for the </v>

696
00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:54.780
<v Speaker 2>very poor and a lot of people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

697
00:35:54.781 --> 00:35:55.614
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of African American </v>

698
00:35:57.271 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 2>citizens that are just desperate to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>their school,</v>

699
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:00.683
<v Speaker 2>their children into better schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians almost without exception </v>

700
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:03.601
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

701
00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:04.434
<v Speaker 2>the state would be involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only acceptable libertarian policy </v>

702
00:36:07.181 --> 00:36:09.750
<v Speaker 2>is the immediate elimination of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>

703
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

704
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:12.743
<v Speaker 2>this is the part that is not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic part because they're direct </v>

705
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:16.263
<v Speaker 2>their destination lists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the destination lists are always </v>

706
00:36:20.191 --> 00:36:22.960
<v Speaker 2>going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Libertarians are,</v>

707
00:36:22.961 --> 00:36:23.794
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have any success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are gonna have to appeal to the </v>

708
00:36:25.411 --> 00:36:28.200
<v Speaker 2>directionalist in both parties that say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

709
00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:29.034
<v Speaker 2>the government has too many powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We may disagree about how far back we </v>

710
00:36:31.921 --> 00:36:32.754
<v Speaker 2>want to move it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's move the train in the other </v>

711
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:35.310
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

712
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:38.130
<v Speaker 2>We're going the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a consensus.</v>

713
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:40.380
<v Speaker 2>We should move it back where we get off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the train.</v>

714
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:41.950
<v Speaker 2>That's a different question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

715
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:45.360
<v Speaker 2>but let's change the direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you say is the easiest way to</v>

716
00:36:45.361 --> 00:36:49.530
<v Speaker 2>explain state power?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A state,</v>

717
00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.493
<v Speaker 2>local or federal to the person that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't quite get this to the person </v>

718
00:36:53.731 --> 00:36:57.120
<v Speaker 2>that when you talk about government </v>
<v Speaker 2>power in government or reach,</v>

719
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.220
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just think it's like you're talking</v>

720
00:36:59.221 --> 00:37:01.470
<v Speaker 2>about some sort of ephemeral thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really exist.</v>

721
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.453
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the best argument to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get them to start understanding the </v>

722
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:07.080
<v Speaker 2>ideas of why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of what liberty really is?</v>

723
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is obviously something I've thought</v>

724
00:37:08.971 --> 00:37:11.250
<v Speaker 2>about a lot and I haven't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeeded,</v>

725
00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:12.930
<v Speaker 2>so you're asking what the best argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

726
00:37:12.931 --> 00:37:13.764
<v Speaker 2>but it's very frustrating because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a conception of a thing called a </v>

727
00:37:16.711 --> 00:37:19.590
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so something I've written a lot about is</v>

728
00:37:19.591 --> 00:37:21.240
<v Speaker 2>the unicorn conception of the state.</v>

729
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:22.733
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mass transit proposal and what we'll </v>

730
00:37:28.051 --> 00:37:28.884
<v Speaker 2>have is these large carts that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled by Unicorns and Unicorns are </v>

731
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 2>great for mass transit because they eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>rainbows.</v>

732
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:41.240
<v Speaker 2>There are very strong and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>flatulent smells like fresh strawberry,</v>

733
00:37:41.241 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 2>so there's no emission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not know that part.</v>

734
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.640
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no emissions problem.</v>

735
00:37:44.641 --> 00:37:46.380
<v Speaker 2>That's really great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you could object.</v>

736
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:47.503
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a problem with this </v>

737
00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:50.790
<v Speaker 2>actually because Unicorns don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

738
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Close your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see one,</v>

739
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:58.020
<v Speaker 2>so why they totally exist in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can imagine them.</v>

740
00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:59.423
<v Speaker 2>That's how people think of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I say here's the state is messing </v>

741
00:38:03.571 --> 00:38:04.620
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

742
00:38:04.621 --> 00:38:05.454
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we are bad people or we need to </v>

743
00:38:07.231 --> 00:38:10.920
<v Speaker 2>do is get the right depth better because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine a state that's doing these</v>

744
00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:13.440
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to fight that.</v>

745
00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:14.274
<v Speaker 2>So the argument that I tried to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having given that caveat that it's hard </v>

746
00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:18.504
<v Speaker 2>to fight unicorns because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people want is something they can </v>

747
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:22.980
<v Speaker 2>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not something that exists.</v>

748
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.333
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the argument that I actually tried </v>

749
00:38:26.841 --> 00:38:30.630
<v Speaker 2>to make is that every flaw in consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are many,</v>

750
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 2>is worse in voters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think consumers are too stupid to</v>

751
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:40.510
<v Speaker 2>be able to choose what size to buy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>which car to buy.</v>

752
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.333
<v Speaker 2>Voters have all those problems and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>so my colleague Dan Arielli at Duke who </v>

753
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:48.580
<v Speaker 2>writes about rationality and consumer </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

754
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:51.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and once the state to intervene,</v>

755
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.070
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just people.</v>

756
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:55.263
<v Speaker 2>If we're going to have voters choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>what these experts are going to make </v>

757
00:38:57.971 --> 00:39:00.460
<v Speaker 2>people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be even worse than the market.</v>

758
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.413
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a.</v>

759
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.060
<v Speaker 2>So basically we are the flaw in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system in a,</v>

760
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:04.894
<v Speaker 2>in a really perverse way that the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is one that recognizes that and </v>

761
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:13.120
<v Speaker 2>doesn't try to do too much because if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>give voters enough power,</v>

762
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:18.390
<v Speaker 2>they'll do what they did in the south </v>
<v Speaker 2>and afflict minorities.</v>

763
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.250
<v Speaker 2>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll or they'll say no.</v>

764
00:39:21.251 --> 00:39:22.084
<v Speaker 2>Same sex marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to think that if you </v>

765
00:39:24.371 --> 00:39:29.260
<v Speaker 2>take one person who's too stupid to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>his own choices at the grocery store and</v>

766
00:39:29.261 --> 00:39:33.940
<v Speaker 2>put them together into an angry mob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can then choose a good precedent or</v>

767
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.610
<v Speaker 2>a good f,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the food and Drug Administration.</v>

768
00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:37.803
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about that mob for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second because I sensed that both sides </v>

769
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:45.130
<v Speaker 2>right now are being led by their mob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it more on the left,</v>

770
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.630
<v Speaker 2>but I do see it on the right as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just the hysterical people who have</v>

771
00:39:49.631 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Speaker 2>all the magical answers who have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was only their messiah.</v>

772
00:39:52.961 --> 00:39:53.794
<v Speaker 2>So the hysterical people on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have their messiah in office right </v>

773
00:39:56.561 --> 00:39:57.394
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the hysterical people and on the </v>

774
00:39:57.821 --> 00:40:00.040
<v Speaker 2>left that if they only had Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would all be okay.</v>

775
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.833
<v Speaker 2>The middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to get that middle of mob to </v>

776
00:40:03.761 --> 00:40:04.420
<v Speaker 2>get going.</v>

777
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.253
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very difficult to be deeply </v>

778
00:40:07.391 --> 00:40:12.391
<v Speaker 2>committed to moderation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm yates has that poem where he says</v>

779
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.500
<v Speaker 2>the worst are full of passionate </v>
<v Speaker 2>intensity,</v>

780
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.010
<v Speaker 2>while the best lack all conviction </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're thinking,</v>

781
00:40:21.011 --> 00:40:22.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually hard.</v>

782
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:23.680
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of people that think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not hard.</v>

783
00:40:23.681 --> 00:40:26.920
<v Speaker 2>They know exactly what to do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

784
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 2>if it's gonna work needs to have rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions,</v>

785
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.080
<v Speaker 2>constitutions that prevent them from </v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to control the government,</v>

786
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.560
<v Speaker 2>and that's the genius of what our </v>
<v Speaker 2>Constitution has done.</v>

787
00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.813
<v Speaker 2>That separation of powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand it's really frustrating </v>

788
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:43.503
<v Speaker 2>because it means that you feel strongly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There seems to be majority in favor of </v>

789
00:40:47.621 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 2>it and yet we still can't do it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the president doesn't go along.</v>

790
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:51.184
<v Speaker 2>The Supreme Court doesn't go along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that a lot of times the status </v>

791
00:40:54.311 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 2>quo is privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the alternative is to have a mop and</v>

792
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.393
<v Speaker 2>Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he thought of democracy actually </v>

793
00:41:01.961 --> 00:41:03.610
<v Speaker 2>talked about too much.</v>

794
00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Liberty means that you've got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>butlers that are drunk on,</v>

795
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:10.990
<v Speaker 2>on liberty's heady wide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

796
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.853
<v Speaker 2>and that they'll say if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they find a leader who doesn't give </v>

797
00:41:15.371 --> 00:41:16.360
<v Speaker 2>them too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

798
00:41:16.361 --> 00:41:18.670
<v Speaker 2>they'll call them blackbirds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>oligarchs,</v>

799
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.040
<v Speaker 2>that you should do exactly what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

800
00:41:21.041 --> 00:41:25.330
<v Speaker 2>they don't actually know what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have a real problem in,</v>

801
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.610
<v Speaker 2>and this is an interesting paradox in </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>

802
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.343
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a famous Englishman that said </v>

803
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:31.924
<v Speaker 2>the reason that we put our leaders' </v>
<v Speaker 2>heads on stamps is that we can thumb </v>

804
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:36.644
<v Speaker 2>their noses and lick their hunter park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have both of those attitudes </v>

805
00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 2>towards leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want them to be better than us and to</v>

806
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:43.874
<v Speaker 2>do what we say is part of this also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we think that we need to get our </v>

807
00:41:47.361 --> 00:41:48.194
<v Speaker 2>morals from our leaders too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's changing a little bit </v>

808
00:41:51.021 --> 00:41:53.540
<v Speaker 2>with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that we thought that,</v>

809
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:54.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always want you to.</v>

810
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.340
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>

811
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.170
<v Speaker 2>have the perfect family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to show you the kids.</v>

812
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.153
<v Speaker 2>We know that it's always a fraud and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all cheating on their wives and </v>

813
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.483
<v Speaker 2>doing all sorts of awful things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that we've tried to make our </v>

814
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:04.724
<v Speaker 2>politicians into be perfect humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again is the Messiah thing you're </v>

815
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:07.631
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

816
00:42:07.631 --> 00:42:09.410
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just show.</v>

817
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult.</v>

818
00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.820
<v Speaker 2>We have other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

819
00:42:13.821 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 2>there's basketball to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

820
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 2>there's baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's picnics to go on.</v>

821
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.203
<v Speaker 2>We don't really want to have to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians very closely and so we </v>

822
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:25.280
<v Speaker 2>substitute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really surprised at this,</v>

823
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:30.281
<v Speaker 2>how little voters knew or cared about </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual issues and the issue that I,</v>

824
00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:32.790
<v Speaker 2>as a political scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about that,</v>

825
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:34.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to drive.</v>

826
00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.253
<v Speaker 2>I got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>

827
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm really not interested in that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

828
00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an important issue.</v>

829
00:42:38.571 --> 00:42:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

830
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

831
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're interested in stead is your</v>

832
00:42:43.131 --> 00:42:43.964
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if your character is very much like </v>

833
00:42:47.271 --> 00:42:48.104
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that you'll go off and when </v>

834
00:42:49.671 --> 00:42:51.950
<v Speaker 2>they're not watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do what they would have done.</v>

835
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.640
<v Speaker 2>You will do what they would've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

836
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.160
<v Speaker 2>And so they want you to know are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you like me in terms of core values?</v>

837
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:59.803
<v Speaker 2>And that's why family and things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that matter is that you're a good </v>

838
00:43:02.571 --> 00:43:03.740
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

839
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:07.430
<v Speaker 2>the problem is that trump is a strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>misnomer in that is any.</v>

840
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.570
<v Speaker 2>He said the things that many white </v>
<v Speaker 2>people believed,</v>

841
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:12.853
<v Speaker 2>trump won a majority of white women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the single most </v>

842
00:43:15.651 --> 00:43:20.030
<v Speaker 2>astonishing fact about this election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump won a majority of white women.</v>

843
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:21.103
<v Speaker 2>And the reason is that the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for reasons that I have a hard time </v>

844
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:27.620
<v Speaker 2>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly campaigned on a platform of white</v>

845
00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:28.490
<v Speaker 2>people suck.</v>

846
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:31.850
<v Speaker 2>You guys are privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

847
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:33.163
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's all sorts of reasons why </v>

848
00:43:34.731 --> 00:43:37.700
<v Speaker 2>actually you can say that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as a political strategy,</v>

849
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:40.130
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Clinton,</v>

850
00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:41.450
<v Speaker 2>when she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

851
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.313
<v Speaker 2>how am I not ahead by 50 points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing that they didn't recognize </v>

852
00:43:47.241 --> 00:43:50.240
<v Speaker 2>that they had actually to appeal to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of Americans,</v>

853
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:51.343
<v Speaker 2>not to try to put together a coalition </v>
<v Speaker 2>of disparate interest groups that are </v>

854
00:43:54.441 --> 00:43:58.580
<v Speaker 2>united by nothing except the promise </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to get paid off.</v>

855
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:03.680
<v Speaker 2>So that goes directly to social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I talk about all the time,</v>

856
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:04.993
<v Speaker 2>I assume you see this as a as a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>big threat to the way our political </v>

857
00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:09.740
<v Speaker 2>system should work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

858
00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.140
<v Speaker 2>It sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social injustice,</v>

859
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.333
<v Speaker 2>but in in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's creating these competing interests </v>

860
00:44:16.161 --> 00:44:18.500
<v Speaker 2>that have to sort of knock each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>down a peg.</v>

861
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 2>We're all in favor of justice and social</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice means that we have a system that</v>

862
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:24.734
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

863
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.473
<v Speaker 2>I see social justice as the claim that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there shouldn't be any unearned and to </v>

864
00:44:32.671 --> 00:44:35.880
<v Speaker 2>the extent that people think they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been denied something,</v>

865
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:40.290
<v Speaker 2>that's where this social justice warrior</v>
<v Speaker 2>impulse comes from and it's particularly</v>

866
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:41.124
<v Speaker 2>interesting being on college campuses to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what social justice warriors have </v>

867
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:49.020
<v Speaker 2>done where they won't even allow other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to speak.</v>

868
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.273
<v Speaker 2>So there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a broad problem of free speech </v>

869
00:44:52.921 --> 00:44:53.754
<v Speaker 2>and social justice and then the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>on college campuses that I have to deal </v>

870
00:44:58.141 --> 00:44:58.974
<v Speaker 2>with often personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the social justice warriors and </v>

871
00:45:01.891 --> 00:45:02.724
<v Speaker 2>academic freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a little bit different from </v>

872
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.240
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of speech.</v>

873
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Academic freedom is a different concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

874
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:09.263
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

875
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social justice impulse to the extent</v>

876
00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:18.330
<v Speaker 2>that it's a number of people have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think Milton Friedman said it.</v>

877
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.420
<v Speaker 2>If you take money from a and give it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

878
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 2>it's likely be will vote for you.</v>

879
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.673
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that it's the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to do just campaigning with other </v>

880
00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:31.170
<v Speaker 2>people's money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all of us are clever.</v>

881
00:45:31.171 --> 00:45:32.004
<v Speaker 2>We can come up with reasons why you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should get something and you should get </v>

882
00:45:34.081 --> 00:45:35.490
<v Speaker 2>something in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should get something,</v>

883
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.830
<v Speaker 2>but at some point you run out of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's money.</v>

884
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've just split.</v>

885
00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Now this thing into a gajillion things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So discussing this on,</v>

886
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.800
<v Speaker 2>on the campus front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

887
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.083
<v Speaker 2>how bad is it on campuses right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to professors all in all sorts </v>

888
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:55.380
<v Speaker 2>of different disciplines and almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody says it's pretty terrible.</v>

889
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.753
<v Speaker 2>I'm really spoiled because I'm at Duke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean you've probably heard about </v>

890
00:46:00.571 --> 00:46:02.820
<v Speaker 2>how bad Charles Murray's visit to duke </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

891
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Probably didn't because it was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had Charles Murray in.</v>

892
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the one that got me there,</v>

893
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.120
<v Speaker 2>which was the one that was the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

894
00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.320
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

895
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.670
<v Speaker 2>a number of places that Charles Murray </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried.</v>

896
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

897
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've turned out really badly.</v>

898
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.823
<v Speaker 2>He came to duke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were three idiots with booboos </v>

899
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 2>alien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the room was quite.</v>

900
00:46:25.381 --> 00:46:26.720
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't even hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

901
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:29.070
<v Speaker 2>it was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People asked some questions.</v>

902
00:46:29.071 --> 00:46:29.904
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked that they ask more rude </v>

903
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:33.150
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a grownup,</v>

904
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:36.810
<v Speaker 2>is happy to answer aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rude questions.</v>

905
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:42.170
<v Speaker 2>So I think that the answer is I have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>odd view probably.</v>

906
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of safe spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

907
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:45.860
<v Speaker 2>So you wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to ask about it.</v>

908
00:46:45.861 --> 00:46:46.694
<v Speaker 2>So you wrote a piece on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on learn liberty in defensive safe </v>

909
00:46:49.261 --> 00:46:50.760
<v Speaker 2>spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which as I read it,</v>

910
00:46:50.761 --> 00:46:53.700
<v Speaker 2>you parse it to a point that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes some sense to me because I'm not a</v>

911
00:46:53.701 --> 00:46:55.530
<v Speaker 2>safe space guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So take it away.</v>

912
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an attempt at judo,</v>

913
00:46:57.730 --> 00:46:58.563
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm using safe space in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people who were in favor of safe </v>

914
00:47:02.251 --> 00:47:02.881
<v Speaker 2>spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

915
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:03.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

916
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

917
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

918
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:06.343
<v Speaker 2>you kind of flip it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So can you explain to me the main </v>

919
00:47:08.851 --> 00:47:12.570
<v Speaker 2>principle universities are operating on </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not freedom of speech.</v>

920
00:47:12.571 --> 00:47:15.330
<v Speaker 2>We can say anything you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but academic freedom,</v>

921
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.193
<v Speaker 2>which means that you can go off into </v>
<v Speaker 2>little groups and be insulated from </v>

922
00:47:20.761 --> 00:47:23.640
<v Speaker 2>people that you disagree with so you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>work on something.</v>

923
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:28.020
<v Speaker 2>So the political scientists are working </v>
<v Speaker 2>on something in a particular way.</v>

924
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Sociology is working on something in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular way.</v>

925
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:31.803
<v Speaker 2>We have communities of scholars that </v>
<v Speaker 2>work on things and in our talks there's </v>

926
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:37.180
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of things that are shared </v>
<v Speaker 2>premises,</v>

927
00:47:37.181 --> 00:47:41.860
<v Speaker 2>shared assumptions and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to advance without constantly having</v>

928
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 2>to confront all of the other possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways of thinking about this.</v>

929
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

930
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 2>so you're describing that as a safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

931
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.690
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's not exactly what the,</v>

932
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know that many people would</v>

933
00:47:54.491 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 2>argue that that isn't okay.</v>

934
00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the people that are a safe space,</v>

935
00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:01.280
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we can go on to,</v>

936
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:02.800
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to raise the question.</v>

937
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:03.783
<v Speaker 2>And Van Jones has this amazing video </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he makes exactly the right </v>

938
00:48:09.221 --> 00:48:10.054
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you cannot do is annex the </v>

939
00:48:12.341 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 2>entire university as a safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot say,</v>

940
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I want to be all across the university </v>
<v Speaker 2>safe from anything that I disagree with.</v>

941
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:22.953
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the very fact that there's these </v>

942
00:48:24.191 --> 00:48:25.024
<v Speaker 2>different safe spaces that nearly ensure</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be somebody working on </v>

943
00:48:28.721 --> 00:48:32.800
<v Speaker 2>things you totally disagree with and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be safe within that space.</v>

944
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

945
00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.453
<v Speaker 2>prevent them from doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we need safe spaces for </v>

946
00:48:39.491 --> 00:48:42.660
<v Speaker 2>examples for fraternities and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

947
00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the safe space.</v>

948
00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:47.110
<v Speaker 2>People are near the fraternities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

949
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:51.040
<v Speaker 2>people need to be able to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>associations.</v>

950
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:54.400
<v Speaker 2>So there's five freedoms that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>guaranteed in the first amendment and we</v>

951
00:48:54.401 --> 00:48:55.234
<v Speaker 2>forget freedom of association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of association means I get to </v>

952
00:48:58.301 --> 00:48:59.134
<v Speaker 2>choose the people that I hang out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if I want to have a club or </v>

953
00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:05.230
<v Speaker 2>organization and we have rules and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to talk about the stuff,</v>

954
00:49:05.231 --> 00:49:06.290
<v Speaker 2>we want to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibin,</v>

955
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.950
<v Speaker 2>the speakers that we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's Milo.</v>

956
00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people seem to be lost and confused.</v>

957
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.093
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even with the guests that we choose </v>

958
00:49:16.691 --> 00:49:17.524
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I choose one person to love me for a </v>

959
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:20.943
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I put on one person who they don't </v>

960
00:49:22.121 --> 00:49:25.210
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly they they prescribe all of that</v>

961
00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:27.310
<v Speaker 2>person's beliefs onto me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

962
00:49:27.311 --> 00:49:29.480
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just asking them questions and and</v>

963
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.160
<v Speaker 2>listening to the answers and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>either turn it off or maybe you'll learn</v>

964
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:33.994
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So John Stuart mill has this great idea </v>

965
00:49:36.461 --> 00:49:37.294
<v Speaker 2>of education where he says it requires </v>
<v Speaker 2>collision with error and the way I try </v>

966
00:49:40.481 --> 00:49:41.314
<v Speaker 2>to explain it to people is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this happens much more on </v>

967
00:49:43.781 --> 00:49:44.614
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of the young students on the </v>

968
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:49.990
<v Speaker 2>left have just learned one move chess </v>
<v Speaker 2>openings.</v>

969
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.393
<v Speaker 2>They moved upon in front of their king </v>
<v Speaker 2>out two spaces and then their patted on </v>

970
00:49:55.031 --> 00:49:55.864
<v Speaker 2>the head until good liberal and somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows a five move chess opening in </v>

971
00:50:00.881 --> 00:50:03.040
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really upset.</v>

972
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

973
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:06.303
<v Speaker 2>you must be a bad person and in fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to prevent that because I </v>

974
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:10.444
<v Speaker 2>don't know why your argument is false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only possible explanation is that </v>

975
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:16.180
<v Speaker 2>it's evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you're a racist bigot.</v>

976
00:50:16.181 --> 00:50:17.014
<v Speaker 2>Homophobic Saturday because they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>never actually had to confront people </v>

977
00:50:19.541 --> 00:50:20.374
<v Speaker 2>that they disagreed with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so collision with error means that </v>

978
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:24.034
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly trying to improve your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own views because if you find someone </v>

979
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:30.680
<v Speaker 2>you disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of two things is true.</v>

980
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.173
<v Speaker 2>Either you are right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know the reasons and you </v>

981
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:34.874
<v Speaker 2>should think about it because not </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing the reasons is a lot like not </v>

982
00:50:37.971 --> 00:50:38.804
<v Speaker 2>knowing the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Memorizing some catechism of truths is </v>

983
00:50:42.531 --> 00:50:43.850
<v Speaker 2>not what college is about.</v>

984
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 2>It's learning reasons and being able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason critically.</v>

985
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:51.230
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that unless you know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best argument against your position.</v>

986
00:50:51.231 --> 00:50:53.600
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that I'm pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgmental about this,</v>

987
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask people that's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim.</v>

988
00:50:57.081 --> 00:50:59.030
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is the best counter </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument to that?</v>

989
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:00.081
<v Speaker 2>And if they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

990
00:51:00.081 --> 00:51:02.840
<v Speaker 2>there isn't one we're done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know anything.</v>

991
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:04.310
<v Speaker 2>But if they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

992
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:05.144
<v Speaker 2>there's actually two that I have a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with and I think I can answer </v>

993
00:51:07.341 --> 00:51:09.230
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're interesting arguments.</v>

994
00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.860
<v Speaker 2>That person's an intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

995
00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.013
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because some of my best </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments you can see the way I interview </v>

996
00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:15.410
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really,</v>

997
00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:16.244
<v Speaker 2>I haven't looked at it the notes once </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm trying to hear you and just go </v>

998
00:51:17.961 --> 00:51:18.794
<v Speaker 2>where it feels natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of my best moments on the show </v>

999
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I think are where someone has pinned me </v>
<v Speaker 2>into thinking,</v>

1000
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.650
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

1001
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I really have to reevaluate something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I.</v>

1002
00:51:26.561 --> 00:51:27.394
<v Speaker 2>and that's how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you evolve and that's how </v>

1003
00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:29.354
<v Speaker 2>most of us are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet we've so that go with that in </v>

1004
00:51:31.591 --> 00:51:34.970
<v Speaker 2>the public and I think some of it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>generational.</v>

1005
00:51:34.971 --> 00:51:35.804
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the young students just have </v>
<v Speaker 2>never thought about the problem of </v>

1006
00:51:41.091 --> 00:51:41.924
<v Speaker 2>having to learn by arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that I do in class </v>

1007
00:51:46.071 --> 00:51:50.840
<v Speaker 2>and it's it worked better than I thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>was I divide the students into pairs and</v>

1008
00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:52.940
<v Speaker 2>they have to choose a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to debate.</v>

1009
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.003
<v Speaker 2>And then on the day of the debate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the debates or 30 minutes on the day of </v>

1010
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.900
<v Speaker 2>the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them hold up big ass yellow dice</v>

1011
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.650
<v Speaker 2>because there's not enough ritual in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

1012
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:05.090
<v Speaker 2>So you have to hold the dice over your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head and you roll it.</v>

1013
00:52:05.091 --> 00:52:05.924
<v Speaker 2>And whoever gets the higher role gets to</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose which side that know which side </v>

1014
00:52:10.011 --> 00:52:11.810
<v Speaker 2>you're arguing until that moment.</v>

1015
00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that go?</v>

1016
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:14.343
<v Speaker 2>It they love it because they actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pay much more attention now to </v>

1017
00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:21.110
<v Speaker 2>things they disagree with because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't understand it.</v>

1018
00:52:21.111 --> 00:52:24.740
<v Speaker 2>They may have to argue it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find that sometimes the ones that</v>

1019
00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:25.574
<v Speaker 2>are arguing things they don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do a better job because of </v>

1020
00:52:27.681 --> 00:52:29.470
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're actually there.</v>

1021
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Do they have to do more intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and they're not so emotional?</v>

1022
00:52:33.621 --> 00:52:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Where I have an attachment to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular position,</v>

1023
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:40.670
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for me to explain it because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just know it's right.</v>

1024
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:41.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if it's an argument I don't </v>

1025
00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:43.784
<v Speaker 2>agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of it logically step by </v>

1026
00:52:45.021 --> 00:52:48.770
<v Speaker 2>step and I'm presenting evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a lot of times they end up saying,</v>

1027
00:52:48.771 --> 00:52:49.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1028
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.963
<v Speaker 2>I kind of got to change my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not really what I believed after </v>

1029
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:53.054
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or at least I can see why someone would </v>

1030
00:52:54.051 --> 00:52:55.010
<v Speaker 2>believed the opposite.</v>

1031
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 2>That's what education is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1032
00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:01.130
<v Speaker 2>So it sounds like your situation at Duke</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pretty good and maybe they've.</v>

1033
00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.293
<v Speaker 2>They've managed to figure out the free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech thing a little bit better than </v>

1034
00:53:06.081 --> 00:53:06.914
<v Speaker 2>most universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duke is really committed to it and the </v>

1035
00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.280
<v Speaker 2>thing is it's not very hard thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>commit to.</v>

1036
00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:15.620
<v Speaker 2>So our previous president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Namco hands,</v>

1037
00:53:15.621 --> 00:53:17.480
<v Speaker 2>the best college president I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen,</v>

1038
00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:18.853
<v Speaker 2>and there was an incident where David </v>
<v Speaker 2>Horowitz had bought this ad about how </v>

1039
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.650
<v Speaker 2>reparations for slavery were racist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1040
00:53:25.651 --> 00:53:28.170
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty incendiary and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the ad.</v>

1041
00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was out of line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the newspaper,</v>

1042
00:53:30.511 --> 00:53:35.511
<v Speaker 2>the Duke Chronicle had allowed the David</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horwitz to purchase a one page ad.</v>

1043
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Now he had done that in a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers.</v>

1044
00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:41.910
<v Speaker 2>You did it at Brown University at Brown </v>
<v Speaker 2>University.</v>

1045
00:53:41.911 --> 00:53:42.744
<v Speaker 2>They had a ceremonial burning of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers on the steps of the admin </v>

1046
00:53:46.711 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 2>building in which the president </v>
<v Speaker 2>participated.</v>

1047
00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:51.780
<v Speaker 2>That's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At Duke,</v>

1048
00:53:51.781 --> 00:53:54.570
<v Speaker 2>what Nan Cohan said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a newspaper.</v>

1049
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.490
<v Speaker 2>You want to buy an ad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

1050
00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a very hard position to take.</v>

1051
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might not have taken that as editor.</v>

1052
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not editor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to contested by Annette,</v>

1053
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 2>so do you think that the students or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty or whatever it was at Brown when</v>

1054
00:54:11.431 --> 00:54:12.264
<v Speaker 2>they do that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think they realized that they </v>

1055
00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:16.710
<v Speaker 2>ultimately strengthen the ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going up against?</v>

1056
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.780
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had David Horowitz on the show.</v>

1057
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:20.910
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a decent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with them on some stuff,</v>

1058
00:54:20.911 --> 00:54:21.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1059
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.193
<v Speaker 2>he was a former leftist and I think 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago was struggling with a lot of </v>

1060
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:27.090
<v Speaker 2>the issues that I'm thinking about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

1061
00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically I sat across from him.</v>

1062
00:54:29.611 --> 00:54:30.900
<v Speaker 2>I thought he's a decent guy.</v>

1063
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:32.003
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think he was some right wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>maniac or all the things that they say </v>

1064
00:54:34.111 --> 00:54:36.800
<v Speaker 2>about him so that when they then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1065
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:37.643
<v Speaker 2>burn the newspapers or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then now you have people doing a </v>

1066
00:54:40.501 --> 00:54:42.420
<v Speaker 2>little research on him and then they may</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1067
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't all crazy what he's saying.</v>

1068
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:48.890
<v Speaker 2>They'll look at the reaction to him that</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the one alternative would be looking</v>

1069
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.470
<v Speaker 2>in the newspaper and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Geez,</v>

1070
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:54.900
<v Speaker 2>that would be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasted all that money because you're not</v>

1071
00:54:54.901 --> 00:54:56.780
<v Speaker 2>persuaded by it either though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

1072
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:59.940
<v Speaker 2>as if people are paying that much </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to newspaper ads,</v>

1073
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:00.451
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1074
00:55:00.451 --> 00:55:03.750
<v Speaker 2>they did after the administration at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown burned it,</v>

1075
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 2>that got so much attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if nothing else,</v>

1076
00:55:07.801 --> 00:55:10.530
<v Speaker 2>it certainly does validate two claims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1077
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:15.890
<v Speaker 2>the university is not capable of holding</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate discussions or confrontations</v>

1078
00:55:15.991 --> 00:55:17.370
<v Speaker 2>with ideas you disagree with.</v>

1079
00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:18.563
<v Speaker 2>And the other is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to look at this ad and see </v>

1080
00:55:19.861 --> 00:55:21.900
<v Speaker 2>what it says because it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial.</v>

1081
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1082
00:55:23.371 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got about 50 minutes and we really</v>

1083
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:26.760
<v Speaker 2>haven't done that much on economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do,</v>

1084
00:55:26.761 --> 00:55:28.450
<v Speaker 2>I want to shift a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1085
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:29.753
<v Speaker 2>because to me it seems that economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could get the economic system to </v>

1086
00:55:34.261 --> 00:55:36.090
<v Speaker 2>work right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means,</v>

1087
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.580
<v Speaker 2>that it does resolve a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political things.</v>

1088
00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Basically if people have jobs and can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1089
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.000
<v Speaker 2>buy some stuff and feel that they own </v>
<v Speaker 2>property and things of that nature,</v>

1090
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:48.030
<v Speaker 2>that those other things will become less</v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1091
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:48.571
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1092
00:55:48.571 --> 00:55:49.404
<v Speaker 2>that's my basic belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's a fair premise to </v>

1093
00:55:51.571 --> 00:55:53.930
<v Speaker 2>start off with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting that so many things are</v>

1094
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:58.940
<v Speaker 2>going on at once because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most recent reason magazine John Nih</v>

1095
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.990
<v Speaker 2>at George Mason University has this </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant article about inequality.</v>

1096
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.900
<v Speaker 2>So it is true that if you look at income</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>

1097
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:10.830
<v Speaker 2>there's more inequality and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>is there's more rich people and the rich</v>

1098
00:56:10.831 --> 00:56:14.190
<v Speaker 2>have gained by more than the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the poor have gained a lot.</v>

1099
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:18.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's compare this to 1800 and 1800.</v>

1100
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:20.760
<v Speaker 2>The mode of transportation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy.</v>

1101
00:56:20.761 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 2>It was very different from the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1102
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:24.603
<v Speaker 2>if I'm really rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I have a tesla and you have a </v>

1103
00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:30.650
<v Speaker 2>dodge minivan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chevy Equinox leased it,</v>

1104
00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.980
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that different really.</v>

1105
00:56:32.981 --> 00:56:35.170
<v Speaker 2>It has air conditioning works pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1106
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:37.630
<v Speaker 2>It gets the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the tesla gets good gas mileage,</v>

1107
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.070
<v Speaker 2>but if there's some sort of status </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference,</v>

1108
00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:44.630
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're basically doing the same thing</v>

1109
00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:45.750
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1110
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 2>we've got an internet connection at </v>
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

1111
00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:50.300
<v Speaker 2>We've got a nice television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1112
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 2>we've got a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got a laptop,</v>

1113
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:56.290
<v Speaker 2>we've got a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some differences in status,</v>

1114
00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:57.363
<v Speaker 2>but there's never been more equality in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the basic way that people live their </v>

1115
00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:01.054
<v Speaker 2>lives and the the difference in if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the difference in life </v>

1116
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:09.280
<v Speaker 2>expectancy between the wealthy and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>port used to be enormous child mortality</v>

1117
00:57:09.281 --> 00:57:10.240
<v Speaker 2>rates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was enormous.</v>

1118
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:14.020
<v Speaker 2>It's converged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our biggest problem is not starvation.</v>

1119
00:57:14.021 --> 00:57:14.854
<v Speaker 2>It's obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there has never been a time of </v>

1120
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:20.140
<v Speaker 2>greater equality.</v>

1121
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Now I know some people are going to hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and go,</v>

1122
00:57:22.381 --> 00:57:23.550
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you libertarians.</v>

1123
00:57:23.551 --> 00:57:26.490
<v Speaker 1>What he's saying is you people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom habit tv,</v>

1124
00:57:26.491 --> 00:57:27.640
<v Speaker 1>have a cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a.</v>

1125
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:30.030
<v Speaker 1>What about the people that don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff?</v>

1126
00:57:30.031 --> 00:57:30.864
<v Speaker 1>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying though is that most </v>

1127
00:57:32.011 --> 00:57:32.844
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom has sort of moved up to have </v>

1128
00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:36.900
<v Speaker 1>a decent level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about that other?</v>

1129
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:40.350
<v Speaker 1>What's the libertarian view of how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>help or not help the,</v>

1130
00:57:40.351 --> 00:57:42.090
<v Speaker 1>the people that don't have that</v>

1131
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:45.440
<v Speaker 2>baseline?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two things.</v>

1132
00:57:45.441 --> 00:57:46.274
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when historians look back at the period </v>

1133
00:57:49.131 --> 00:57:49.964
<v Speaker 2>between 1945 and 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great story is the worldwide </v>

1134
00:57:56.180 --> 00:58:00.650
<v Speaker 2>elimination of policy of poverty through</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>

1135
00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Every country that has chosen markets </v>
<v Speaker 2>has dramatically improved.</v>

1136
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Not just the average but the least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well off China,</v>

1137
00:58:07.911 --> 00:58:08.744
<v Speaker 2>India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty is disappearing around the </v>

1138
00:58:10.521 --> 00:58:11.690
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If by poverty,</v>

1139
00:58:11.691 --> 00:58:12.524
<v Speaker 2>use some objective measure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a subjective or comparative </v>

1140
00:58:15.321 --> 00:58:16.340
<v Speaker 2>measure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1141
00:58:16.341 --> 00:58:18.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem because there's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

1142
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:22.250
<v Speaker 2>There's always going to be one fifth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people in the bottom 20 percent.</v>

1143
00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Just the definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a mathematician,</v>

1144
00:58:24.861 --> 00:58:25.730
<v Speaker 2>but I can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1145
00:58:25.731 --> 00:58:26.564
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1146
00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:27.733
<v Speaker 2>so that's one thing is the allowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>markets solves poverty in a way that no </v>

1147
00:58:33.561 --> 00:58:34.394
<v Speaker 2>government program ever could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better to have a job than a </v>

1148
00:58:36.231 --> 00:58:38.330
<v Speaker 2>handout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

1149
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:43.040
<v Speaker 2>I have written quite a bit about my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>support for universal basic income.</v>

1150
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:44.743
<v Speaker 2>So I think universal basic income is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better solution than the hodgepodge of </v>

1151
00:58:48.621 --> 00:58:50.810
<v Speaker 2>different intrusive programs that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have now.</v>

1152
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:56.470
<v Speaker 2>And let me explain briefly why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we have is a system,</v>

1153
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:59.810
<v Speaker 2>and I wrote a pretty incendiary paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

1154
00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:00.793
<v Speaker 2>The state is just is a bad polygamist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're a single mother and you </v>

1155
00:59:06.321 --> 00:59:09.380
<v Speaker 2>have three children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do one of two things,</v>

1156
00:59:09.381 --> 00:59:10.214
<v Speaker 2>you'll lose your support from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>polygamist if you get a job or get </v>

1157
00:59:13.761 --> 00:59:14.594
<v Speaker 2>married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you actually do something that </v>

1158
00:59:16.431 --> 00:59:19.700
<v Speaker 2>achieved some independence for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your husband,</v>

1159
00:59:19.701 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 2>the state will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll we're getting a divorce,</v>

1160
00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

1161
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can have more children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have affairs,</v>

1162
00:59:25.371 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be committed to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only get support from me,</v>

1163
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:33.320
<v Speaker 2>which means that you can't do any of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that normally we would expect.</v>

1164
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.420
<v Speaker 2>And this is a conservative position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>

1165
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Family and jobs are good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being married and having a job as a good</v>

1166
00:59:39.651 --> 00:59:40.484
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have what many people even on the </v>

1167
00:59:43.341 --> 00:59:48.341
<v Speaker 2>left have called the cliff effect of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits.</v>

1168
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.570
<v Speaker 2>If I'm in section eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>housing and I,</v>

1169
00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I get subsidies for food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get subsidies for school.</v>

1170
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:59.360
<v Speaker 2>The first $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I earned costs me $12,000</v>

1171
00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:01.970
<v Speaker 2>in benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the poor aren't lazy.</v>

1172
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 2>They're rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1173
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:04.280
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there really,</v>

1174
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:06.730
<v Speaker 2>it's just a realistic gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

1175
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not playing a game,</v>

1176
01:00:08.511 --> 01:00:09.344
<v Speaker 2>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making calculations in that </v>

1177
01:00:11.511 --> 01:00:13.000
<v Speaker 2>technical sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1178
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:14.600
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have choices.</v>

1179
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:16.250
<v Speaker 2>They have strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those have payoffs.</v>

1180
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unsurprising.</v>

1181
01:00:17.661 --> 01:00:20.600
<v Speaker 2>They pick the ones that make them better</v>
<v Speaker 2>off because they're desperate.</v>

1182
01:00:20.601 --> 01:00:24.050
<v Speaker 2>They can't afford to lose this money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1183
01:00:24.051 --> 01:00:29.051
<v Speaker 2>if you're living in subsidized housing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a decent area with a decent school,</v>

1184
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:32.210
<v Speaker 2>and even if you don't want those </v>
<v Speaker 2>handouts,</v>

1185
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.140
<v Speaker 2>well then you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1186
01:00:33.141 --> 01:00:35.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna have to work in a third job </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and then,</v>

1187
01:00:35.441 --> 01:00:36.860
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to force me to move.</v>

1188
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.830
<v Speaker 2>I see a much worse place to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't afford childcare,</v>

1189
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:45.030
<v Speaker 2>so the state is a bad polygamist let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop doing that and let's say,</v>

1190
01:00:45.031 --> 01:00:47.960
<v Speaker 2>and another problem as I see it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum wage now,</v>

1191
01:00:47.961 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 2>the effects of minimum wage on overall </v>
<v Speaker 2>employment economists debate,</v>

1192
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:55.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost certainly true that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult for people to get a first</v>

1193
01:00:55.431 --> 01:00:56.264
<v Speaker 2>job or require the experience that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows them to start the staircase to </v>

1194
01:00:59.841 --> 01:01:00.674
<v Speaker 2>the American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the unemployment rate in some urban </v>

1195
01:01:04.371 --> 01:01:08.180
<v Speaker 2>areas for like 15 to 25 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's 40,</v>

1196
01:01:08.181 --> 01:01:09.014
<v Speaker 2>50 percent there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way for people to find a </v>

1197
01:01:10.761 --> 01:01:12.620
<v Speaker 2>first job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we do that?</v>

1198
01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:15.620
<v Speaker 2>While we want to say people should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to live on this,</v>

1199
01:01:15.621 --> 01:01:16.454
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear why your first job should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be something you should be able to live </v>

1200
01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:19.430
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1201
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:20.960
<v Speaker 2>and if any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you even bring that up,</v>

1202
01:01:20.961 --> 01:01:21.860
<v Speaker 2>people get upset.</v>

1203
01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except I say,</v>

1204
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1205
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.393
<v Speaker 2>Let's make sure that they can live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's give them universal basic income </v>

1206
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:28.693
<v Speaker 2>and if they want to get a job at $3 an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour because that's how you get </v>

1207
01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:32.720
<v Speaker 2>experience in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Germany,</v>

1208
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:33.913
<v Speaker 2>if you serve an apprenticeship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making two or $3 an hour after </v>

1209
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:37.364
<v Speaker 2>two years you have enough experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can now get a job that makes $30 an </v>

1210
01:01:40.671 --> 01:01:42.560
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an education.</v>

1211
01:01:42.561 --> 01:01:43.394
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income that's given </v>

1212
01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:46.123
<v Speaker 2>without strengths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We take the money that we're spending </v>

1213
01:01:48.021 --> 01:01:51.980
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is enough to give at least $12,000</v>

1214
01:01:51.981 --> 01:01:52.814
<v Speaker 2>per poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you take the amount that we spend </v>

1215
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:56.810
<v Speaker 2>divided by the number of where are taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>that from.</v>

1216
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:58.243
<v Speaker 2>Well all of these different subsidy </v>
<v Speaker 2>program to all of the subsidy programs </v>

1217
01:02:00.831 --> 01:02:04.040
<v Speaker 2>then go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we including social security.</v>

1218
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 2>So we eliminate all those.</v>

1219
01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:06.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use that money to give everyone a </v>

1220
01:02:09.441 --> 01:02:12.050
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income and if they get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>

1221
01:02:12.051 --> 01:02:13.460
<v Speaker 2>they don't lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they get married,</v>

1222
01:02:13.461 --> 01:02:15.470
<v Speaker 2>they don't lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can use it for childcare.</v>

1223
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:16.603
<v Speaker 2>One of the problems that people have now</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's very specifically tied a </v>

1224
01:02:19.291 --> 01:02:20.124
<v Speaker 2>location,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't go somewhere where there's a </v>

1225
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Speaker 2>job because I won't be able to establish</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

1226
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Universal basic income if it's federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>means that if I'm living in Cleveland,</v>

1227
01:02:29.551 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't find a job.</v>

1228
01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 2>There are jobs in Texas or North </v>
<v Speaker 2>Carolina.</v>

1229
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:36.960
<v Speaker 2>When I get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get universal basic income.</v>

1230
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:39.160
<v Speaker 2>I can establish myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can pay for childcare,</v>

1231
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.013
<v Speaker 2>I can look for a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they actually are jobs in those </v>

1232
01:02:41.971 --> 01:02:42.804
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find a conflict between your </v>

1233
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:45.324
<v Speaker 2>libertarian self and your economists </v>
<v Speaker 2>self on this because it seems like the </v>

1234
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:51.990
<v Speaker 2>idea of a libertarian going to state </v>
<v Speaker 2>should give people money?</v>

1235
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Probably seems like there's some fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1236
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a destination list,</v>

1237
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.470
<v Speaker 2>if I'm a direction list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

1238
01:02:58.471 --> 01:03:00.270
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're giving them the money now.</v>

1239
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're already doing it.</v>

1240
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 2>We're already doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just give the money.</v>

1241
01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:06.180
<v Speaker 2>In a way that's cheaper and increases </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberty.</v>

1242
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.430
<v Speaker 2>That's the basic directionalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

1243
01:03:08.431 --> 01:03:09.264
<v Speaker 2>which is why Milton Friedman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charles Murray are both in favor of </v>

1244
01:03:11.701 --> 01:03:12.534
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has to be a directionless and </v>

1245
01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.220
<v Speaker 2>we're already doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're saying,</v>

1246
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.110
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>

1247
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.850
<v Speaker 2>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>

1248
01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.540
<v Speaker 2>and unless you have some plan to end </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and improve things,</v>

1249
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.910
<v Speaker 2>I'll listen to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what they say.</v>

1250
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:28.021
<v Speaker 2>They just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1251
01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 2>the government shouldn't be giving out </v>
<v Speaker 2>any money.</v>

1252
01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:30.383
<v Speaker 2>It already is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it in a more efficient way and </v>

1253
01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:33.624
<v Speaker 2>in a way that increases liberty because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can then spend that money on what I </v>

1254
01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:38.550
<v Speaker 2>actually want.</v>

1255
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:43.110
<v Speaker 2>We give these vouchers for food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't really want to buy that.</v>

1256
01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:46.140
<v Speaker 2>I want to buy something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sell my food stamps for fifty cents on</v>

1257
01:03:46.141 --> 01:03:48.300
<v Speaker 2>the dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I get money,</v>

1258
01:03:48.301 --> 01:03:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I already have one hundred cents on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar.</v>

1259
01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:50.784
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one objection that people on the </v>

1260
01:03:52.441 --> 01:03:55.080
<v Speaker 2>left when people on the left make is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1261
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.630
<v Speaker 2>those poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how they are,</v>

1262
01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:01.890
<v Speaker 2>they'll spend it on the wrong stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I want is that the argument that</v>

1263
01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:03.030
<v Speaker 2>people on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the left make,</v>

1264
01:04:03.031 --> 01:04:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I think that isn't that usually from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right where they'll say,</v>

1265
01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:05.814
<v Speaker 2>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to spend it on for some </v>

1266
01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:07.453
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a surprising number of people left </v>

1267
01:04:09.601 --> 01:04:10.560
<v Speaker 2>belief that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1268
01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:11.603
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I like about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it sort of divides the usual </v>

1269
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:20.370
<v Speaker 2>political split by how paternalistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

1270
01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:21.383
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole bunch of people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left that really think experts and </v>

1271
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.333
<v Speaker 2>honestly rich white people should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying here's how these poor people </v>

1272
01:04:29.581 --> 01:04:31.050
<v Speaker 2>should be spending their time and money.</v>

1273
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is probably not.</v>

1274
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Well that shows you that a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 2>paternalism and authoritarianism and all</v>

1275
01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your next book,</v>

1276
01:04:39.691 --> 01:04:41.310
<v Speaker 2>which is called tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three point.</v>

1277
01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.144
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is sort of partly what it's going </v>

1278
01:04:43.811 --> 01:04:44.461
<v Speaker 2>to be about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1279
01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:45.294
<v Speaker 2>Because that we're going to about to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>into another revolution which is going </v>

1280
01:04:48.571 --> 01:04:49.404
<v Speaker 2>to be a shared economy and technological</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution and that all sort of plays </v>

1281
01:04:53.401 --> 01:04:54.234
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose basic income and just the way </v>

1282
01:04:56.071 --> 01:04:57.930
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1283
01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.030
<v Speaker 2>ipads and replacing people at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's.</v>

1284
01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:02.880
<v Speaker 2>This is just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting,</v>

1285
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:03.803
<v Speaker 2>so Marc Andreessen in November 2011 </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a piece for the Wall Street </v>

1286
01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.813
<v Speaker 2>Journal in which he said software eats </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and what he meant was that </v>

1287
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:18.460
<v Speaker 2>software is to serve as jobs as robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Automation are to production,</v>

1288
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:19.323
<v Speaker 2>so we're used to thinking of factories </v>
<v Speaker 2>as being a transformation from a bunch </v>

1289
01:05:23.351 --> 01:05:25.300
<v Speaker 2>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting stuff together to machines,</v>

1290
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:27.580
<v Speaker 2>putting stuff together and it's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient,</v>

1291
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.020
<v Speaker 2>but it means there's fewer jobs.</v>

1292
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:30.303
<v Speaker 2>So capitalism almost always reduces jobs</v>
<v Speaker 2>by increasing productivity as a trump </v>

1293
01:05:35.951 --> 01:05:38.710
<v Speaker 2>was wrong and saying that we're sending </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs to China.</v>

1294
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:39.544
<v Speaker 2>The whole world is losing jobs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity and that's good because </v>

1295
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:46.570
<v Speaker 2>consumer products are reduced in price </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it means that we're all wealthier.</v>

1296
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.553
<v Speaker 2>The reason that everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost everyone can afford a car and a </v>

1297
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 2>cell phone is that the price of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things has fallen so much.</v>

1298
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Problem is until now we've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1299
01:05:57.101 --> 01:06:00.850
<v Speaker 2>there's always the service economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can always get service jobs.</v>

1300
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:02.103
<v Speaker 2>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's being hastened by the push </v>

1301
01:06:04.421 --> 01:06:08.020
<v Speaker 2>for increased minimum wages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Seattle,</v>

1302
01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:10.300
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a fast food restaurant,</v>

1303
01:06:10.301 --> 01:06:11.134
<v Speaker 2>you're probably investigating kiosks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have to pay $15 an hour to </v>

1304
01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:19.030
<v Speaker 2>have some guy who really isn't worth $15</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour at the front desk.</v>

1305
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:19.883
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the the service jobs are going to be </v>

1306
01:06:21.341 --> 01:06:22.630
<v Speaker 2>taken over by software.</v>

1307
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:24.603
<v Speaker 2>It's not clear to me that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to take people who are not </v>

1308
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:31.443
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently well trained by the state </v>
<v Speaker 2>education system to be able to work in </v>

1309
01:06:35.711 --> 01:06:38.170
<v Speaker 2>the new economy to make that transition </v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly.</v>

1310
01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:41.830
<v Speaker 2>So I think universal basic income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make a static argument.</v>

1311
01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:46.090
<v Speaker 2>We're spending the money already so we </v>
<v Speaker 2>might as well spend it more efficiently.</v>

1312
01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.253
<v Speaker 2>But then there's a dynamic argument to </v>
<v Speaker 2>over time the move to the sharing </v>

1313
01:06:51.821 --> 01:06:52.654
<v Speaker 2>economy probably benefits most of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we can rent rather than own a </v>

1314
01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:00.940
<v Speaker 2>prices are going to fall dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll need a lot less stuff.</v>

1315
01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.220
<v Speaker 2>The sharing economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just so people,</v>

1316
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:05.590
<v Speaker 2>for the people that don't fully get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically that you wouldn't even have</v>

1317
01:07:05.591 --> 01:07:08.080
<v Speaker 2>to necessarily own your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That all of the.</v>

1318
01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:11.130
<v Speaker 2>All of the things that we kind of have </v>
<v Speaker 2>wood,</v>

1319
01:07:11.131 --> 01:07:13.330
<v Speaker 2>we'd figure out better ways to use them.</v>

1320
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:14.163
<v Speaker 2>So you wouldn't have to fork out as much</v>
<v Speaker 2>money for them in the first place and </v>

1321
01:07:16.301 --> 01:07:17.134
<v Speaker 2>we'd figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to use it on Tuesdays at </v>

1322
01:07:18.521 --> 01:07:21.210
<v Speaker 2>this time and you're going to use it </v>
<v Speaker 2>then and the exam that.</v>

1323
01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.093
<v Speaker 2>Is that the base?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1324
01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:25.450
<v Speaker 2>The example that I always use and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think people recognize it,</v>

1325
01:07:25.451 --> 01:07:26.284
<v Speaker 2>is I have a black BMW 3:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just the sort of person you </v>

1326
01:07:31.721 --> 01:07:34.500
<v Speaker 2>think I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that drives a black BMW 3:30.</v>

1327
01:07:34.501 --> 01:07:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I zooming in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very expensive car.</v>

1328
01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I park it at a special shrine at my </v>
<v Speaker 2>house and I approach it.</v>

1329
01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:42.784
<v Speaker 2>The door opens now it's a garage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's pretty expensive storage and </v>

1330
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.910
<v Speaker 2>since I worked as an administrator at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Duke for a long time,</v>

1331
01:07:48.911 --> 01:07:51.050
<v Speaker 2>I have the parking space of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1332
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:52.053
<v Speaker 2>I can park in a great space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my car is really expensive and it's </v>

1333
01:07:56.051 --> 01:07:58.210
<v Speaker 2>always taking up two pieces of real </v>
<v Speaker 2>estate,</v>

1334
01:07:58.211 --> 01:08:01.210
<v Speaker 2>the garage and my parking space at Duke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is reserved for me.</v>

1335
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:02.703
<v Speaker 2>When you multiply that by the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drive my car 30 slash 40 minutes a </v>

1336
01:08:06.431 --> 01:08:07.264
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the rest of the time it's just </v>

1337
01:08:09.551 --> 01:08:10.384
<v Speaker 2>sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what's going to happen 50 years </v>

1338
01:08:12.191 --> 01:08:13.024
<v Speaker 2>from now is that people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look back and be astonished at the </v>

1339
01:08:16.101 --> 01:08:16.934
<v Speaker 2>extent to which we were so selfish that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we wanted to keep stuff so other people </v>

1340
01:08:20.871 --> 01:08:21.704
<v Speaker 2>couldn't use it and spend a lot of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>storing it so other people couldn't use </v>

1341
01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:26.330
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1342
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:29.120
<v Speaker 2>to some extent that gives us status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an old guy.</v>

1343
01:08:29.121 --> 01:08:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I probably have pictures of my pathetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>car on facebook.</v>

1344
01:08:31.961 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young people don't do that.</v>

1345
01:08:33.441 --> 01:08:36.710
<v Speaker 2>They're more interested in accumulating </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences than they are stuff,</v>

1346
01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:37.953
<v Speaker 2>so I think that there's a cultural shift</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards a sympathy towards not having </v>

1347
01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:45.440
<v Speaker 2>such a big impact on the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reducing your footprint.</v>

1348
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.083
<v Speaker 2>So if a car is constantly in use instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sitting in my garage or a parking </v>

1349
01:08:50.871 --> 01:08:51.704
<v Speaker 2>space all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll need far fewer of them will be </v>

1350
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:56.990
<v Speaker 2>able to have bike lanes because we won't</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to have all this parking space.</v>

1351
01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:58.093
<v Speaker 2>We won't need to have closets or storage</v>
<v Speaker 2>units where we have all this crap that </v>

1352
01:09:01.461 --> 01:09:04.190
<v Speaker 2>we don't even need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Storage units are pretty amazing.</v>

1353
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:07.970
<v Speaker 2>We have all of this stuff that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not using it and you never go there.</v>

1354
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Well it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somebody else could be using it.</v>

1355
01:09:11.121 --> 01:09:11.954
<v Speaker 2>The reason that they're not using it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's too difficult for you to find </v>

1356
01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:16.184
<v Speaker 2>that other person software is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change our ability to find someone to </v>

1357
01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:20.534
<v Speaker 2>share it with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find a little bit that that can </v>

1358
01:09:22.461 --> 01:09:25.290
<v Speaker 2>be at odds with a individualism that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

1359
01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.450
<v Speaker 2>You're not saying that you wouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right to own things right in,</v>

1360
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.903
<v Speaker 2>that's not the end conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people I think want the use of </v>

1361
01:09:33.831 --> 01:09:34.664
<v Speaker 2>something and in our current system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>owning it is the cheapest way to have </v>

1362
01:09:39.831 --> 01:09:43.640
<v Speaker 2>something available to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's fairly common for.</v>

1363
01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a Tuxedo.</v>

1364
01:09:44.931 --> 01:09:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't wear it very often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1365
01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:50.690
<v Speaker 2>many women have gowns that they wear </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe once now.</v>

1366
01:09:50.691 --> 01:09:54.650
<v Speaker 2>The reason that they don't rent the gown</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's too difficult to find it in</v>

1367
01:09:54.651 --> 01:09:55.484
<v Speaker 2>exactly their size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but suppose you had an app that could </v>

1368
01:09:58.461 --> 01:09:59.294
<v Speaker 2>take computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laser measurements and get exactly the </v>

1369
01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:02.534
<v Speaker 2>right measurement and it's delivered to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you two days from now and instead of an </v>

1370
01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:10.660
<v Speaker 2>$800 gown that you wear once it's $100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>rental and it's a designer gown.</v>

1371
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.760
<v Speaker 2>That would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1372
01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:18.320
<v Speaker 2>so everything's changing I think is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theme of this hour.</v>

1373
01:10:18.321 --> 01:10:19.154
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot changing politically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot changing economically and </v>

1374
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:23.503
<v Speaker 2>we just gotta be smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully not go totally off the ditch </v>

1375
01:10:27.051 --> 01:10:28.280
<v Speaker 2>as we're navigating it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

1376
01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.173
<v Speaker 2>I'm mostly optimistic because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>our institutions are pretty strong and </v>

1377
01:10:33.561 --> 01:10:36.380
<v Speaker 2>people recognize that there's a problem.</v>

1378
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:40.610
<v Speaker 2>The social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet,</v>

1379
01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:44.180
<v Speaker 2>access to software all create </v>
<v Speaker 2>disruptions,</v>

1380
01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:45.523
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at human history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the best things have happened </v>

1381
01:10:48.801 --> 01:10:49.634
<v Speaker 2>after a period of disruption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the period of disruption can be </v>

1382
01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:53.760
<v Speaker 2>pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 18,</v>

1383
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:54.643
<v Speaker 2>forties and fifties in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cities were on fire because of the </v>

1384
01:10:57.291 --> 01:11:00.650
<v Speaker 2>industrial revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The result was mostly good,</v>

1385
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.843
<v Speaker 2>so the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not clear to me what's going to </v>

1386
01:11:03.471 --> 01:11:04.310
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>

1387
01:11:04.311 --> 01:11:06.800
<v Speaker 2>is one of the reasons I'm for universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic income.</v>

1388
01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Let's make sure that those who are least</v>
<v Speaker 2>well off and who are through no fault of</v>

1389
01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 2>their find</v>

1390
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.760
<v Speaker 1>themselves not able to work in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional manufacturing jobs that they</v>

1391
01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:18.594
<v Speaker 1>expected to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make sure that there's some </v>

1392
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 1>minimum on how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on how bad off they are.</v>

1393
01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said,</v>

1394
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.963
<v Speaker 1>I love the framing of that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really is an argument that transcends </v>

1395
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:29.784
<v Speaker 1>the left right thing because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hitting them both at their soft </v>

1396
01:11:32.071 --> 01:11:34.020
<v Speaker 1>spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got a nice,</v>

1397
01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:34.854
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nice ability to get some people to </v>

1398
01:11:35.851 --> 01:11:40.851
<v Speaker 1>come together where we'll see that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue for more Dr Monger.</v>

1399
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Follow him on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll respond.</v>

1400
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:44.491

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>liberty about how when every now and </v>

<v Speaker 1>actually changes.</v>

1404
01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And I'm positive.</v>
