1
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to tell you the classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>children's tale of chicken,</v>

2
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>little otherwise known as henny penny as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tale goes.</v>

3
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:11.874
<v Speaker 1>Little Henny was outside one day when an</v>
<v Speaker 1>acorn fell from a tree and hit her on </v>

4
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>the head because of her naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Tay and simple mindedness.</v>

5
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.014
<v Speaker 1>Henny foolishly began to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky itself was falling down around </v>

6
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:23.574
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She spent the rest of the day trying to </v>

7
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.524
<v Speaker 1>convince others like Goosey loosey and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey lurky that the sky was most </v>

8
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>certainly falling in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world was surely coming to an end in</v>

9
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>most versions of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trip does not end well for Henny and</v>

10
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>her hysterical friends after they meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sly foxy.</v>

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give everything away </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

12
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>so either read the story for yourself or</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out the classic season six episode</v>

13
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>of the Golden Girls in which they </v>
<v Speaker 1>reenact the tail.</v>

14
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned Hani and Lucy and Turkey and</v>
<v Speaker 1>foxy.</v>

15
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Not just because they're great names to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

16
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:55.404
<v Speaker 1>but because it seems that just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is telling us the sky is </v>

17
00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>falling these days between trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and North Korea.</v>

18
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.710
<v Speaker 1>We've got about half the country that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in total freakout mode everyday.</v>

19
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.563
<v Speaker 1>This freak out takes on a new urgency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day the world is ending because </v>

20
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:10.584
<v Speaker 1>America left the Paris climate accord </v>
<v Speaker 1>and another day it's because of the net </v>

21
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>neutrality reversal and another day it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>because trump holds his water glass with</v>

22
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:18.474
<v Speaker 1>two hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This endless hysteria is not only being </v>

23
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:21.624
<v Speaker 1>amplified by the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually being poked and </v>

24
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>prodded by them as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blue check,</v>

25
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:26.634
<v Speaker 1>verify journalists on twitter who worked</v>
<v Speaker 1>for news organizations which really are </v>

26
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:30.924
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than partisan activist </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlets want to keep you clicking on </v>

27
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:34.704
<v Speaker 1>their articles and videos and they know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the best way to do that is to </v>

28
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>convince you that not only is the sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling,</v>

29
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's gonna land directly on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

30
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>What F and just hear me out on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This outrage factory is completely wrong</v>

31
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>and the world isn't coming to an end </v>
<v Speaker 1>just yet crazy.</v>

32
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:52.434
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it actually might be </v>

33
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.314
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean that things are </v>

34
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are pretty damn good.</v>

35
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>This is the position of my guest this </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

36
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Harvard psychology professor Steven </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinker pinker argues,</v>

37
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>despite our world of perceived horror </v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaos,</v>

38
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>people are living longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happier,</v>

39
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 1>healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and freer lives right now,</v>

40
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>more than any other time in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

41
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean we don't have work to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

42
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>but if we don't stop and smell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>roses,</v>

43
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:22.464
<v Speaker 1>we might toss away all the goodness </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans have created for the prospect of </v>

44
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:27.414
<v Speaker 1>a utopia that will never appear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I'm so proud of the work </v>

45
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:31.014
<v Speaker 1>we've done here on the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly believed that the conversations </v>

46
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>we're having are at least some part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the antidote to the craziness right now.</v>

47
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.393
<v Speaker 1>If those of us who care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment principles like science </v>

48
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>reason and natural rights can make our </v>
<v Speaker 1>voices louder than this cliff,</v>

49
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:45.594
<v Speaker 1>we seem to be about to go off of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might just turn into a bridge to a </v>

50
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.554
<v Speaker 1>better world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henny penny story took a drastic turn </v>

51
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>when she met Foxy Lacasse who tricked </v>
<v Speaker 1>her and her friends to go to his layer.</v>

52
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real life,</v>

53
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>we've got a wolf blitzer in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

54
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.923
<v Speaker 1>If the sky is falling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe just changing the channel is all </v>

55
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>we have to do to survive the day.</v>

56
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.433
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is a johnstone family </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor in the Department of </v>

57
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Psychology at Harvard University as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the New York Times bestselling author</v>

58
00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:23.790
<v Speaker 1>whose new book enlightenment now is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sale right now,</v>

59
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Steven Pinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

60
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

61
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.653
<v Speaker 1>I am thrilled to have you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have emailed or called or </v>

62
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.393
<v Speaker 1>contacted or pigeon messaged everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to you or do that knows you in </v>

63
00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:39.710
<v Speaker 1>any way to get you here and here I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>and here you are.</v>

64
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.553
<v Speaker 1>Worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes to prove that a little </v>

65
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.340
<v Speaker 1>positivity I think can make some things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

66
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.600
<v Speaker 1>So true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of want to talk to you about.</v>

68
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.813
<v Speaker 1>I thought before we dive into the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the things that you teach and </v>

69
00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:52.020
<v Speaker 1>write about and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

70
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.883
<v Speaker 1>I like hearing a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's history and where they come </v>

71
00:03:54.871 --> 00:03:56.160
<v Speaker 1>from and growing up and all that.</v>

72
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.420
<v Speaker 1>You are Canadian and I've had a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadians on lately.</v>

73
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I find there's something about Canadians</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general that I like.</v>

74
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:08.370
<v Speaker 1>What is it about Canadians that leads to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain pleasant disposition?</v>

75
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so reasonable or so.</v>

76
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked her.</v>

77
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people say the motto of </v>

78
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.930
<v Speaker 1>candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peace Order and good government.</v>

79
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

80
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.043
<v Speaker 1>it's a country that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has been diverse for quite some </v>

81
00:04:23.191 --> 00:04:24.024
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Quebec where I grew up has a English </v>

82
00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:28.410
<v Speaker 1>speaking community in a French speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

83
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.690
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

84
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.563
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't begin with a revolution like </v>

85
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:34.650
<v Speaker 1>the United States from negotiated our </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to independence.</v>

86
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're part of the British empire and the</v>

87
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.670
<v Speaker 1>British Commonwealth and kind of have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that British reserve and a politeness.</v>

88
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that we have,</v>

89
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.390
<v Speaker 1>we have some things going for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of things going for it.</v>

90
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least until at least the,</v>

91
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:54.210
<v Speaker 1>all the Americans end up moving up there</v>
<v Speaker 1>if things keep going this way.</v>

92
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Although we might build a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys may end up building the wall.</v>

93
00:04:58.201 --> 00:04:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

94
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>tell me a little bit about growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

95
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.420

97
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.410

<v Speaker 1>It was pretty segregated when I grew up.</v>

98

<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>number of people that we're proud of.</v>

111
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

118
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.303
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may just be that I'm having many </v>

119
00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:51.864
<v Speaker 1>cultural influences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both candidates really dominated by the </v>

120
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.033
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is the 800 pound gorilla next </v>

121
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.890
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the American influence,</v>

122
00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>the British influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French influence.</v>

123
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.963
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's just being in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmopolitan diverse community that </v>

124
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.171
<v Speaker 1>helped with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

125
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:07.004
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

126
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

127
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jewish influence,</v>

128
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.750
<v Speaker 1>although it was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

129
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't grow up in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of the people that I mentioned grew</v>

130
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.514
<v Speaker 1>up in an ultra orthodox community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a room with a reform </v>

131
00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:18.300
<v Speaker 1>temple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

132
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.153
<v Speaker 1>we didn't take God all that seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we did take Jewish identity </v>

133
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember a moment in which I </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided,</v>

135
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an atheist.</v>

136
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I just was not a big issue one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

137
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you find that to be sort of standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing with most secular Jews?</v>

138
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.763
<v Speaker 1>I think that's sort of at least the ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had been talking to on this show </v>

139
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>that I think are sort of out there more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be a thing that there's an</v>

140
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>ethnic identity or a cultural identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's separate from the belief part.</v>

141
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's more true of Judaism than</v>

142
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:47.774
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Catholicism where the belief really </v>

143
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 1>is stipulated in Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a bit of a kind of don't ask,</v>

144
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:55.080
<v Speaker 1>don't tell as long as you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>painful.</v>

145
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>As long as we made the laws and rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you keep the sabbath,</v>

146
00:06:58.341 --> 00:06:58.870
<v Speaker 1>if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:59.703
<v Speaker 1>Mazzoni on Passover and then you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good Jew and what you believe is just </v>

148
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:04.004
<v Speaker 1>not as important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One a rabbi said to my wife Rebecca </v>

149
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Goldstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another secular Jew,</v>

150
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.350
<v Speaker 1>well known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

151
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>a secular humanist writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

152
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 1>when she talked about her novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>36 arguments for the existence of God,</v>

153
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>a work of fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of the.</v>

154
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.003
<v Speaker 1>And she spoke at a Jewish community </v>
<v Speaker 1>center and that was a little worried </v>

155
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:24.284
<v Speaker 1>whether there'd be some pushback from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rabbi who introduced her and </v>

156
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 1>afterwards he went over and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not like in Judaism it says you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to believe in God.</v>

158
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.910
<v Speaker 1>You just can't believe that more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>

159
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

160
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's a,</v>

161
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:36.914
<v Speaker 1>there's an inherent problem there sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of disconnecting God from even if it </v>

162
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>really is as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the longevity of it,</v>

163
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.610
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

164
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

165
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.001
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

166
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:47.834
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that may have been part of the </v>

167
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:50.414
<v Speaker 1>explanation for why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so many secular Jewish </v>

168
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals kind of immersed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument disputation,</v>

169
00:07:56.961 --> 00:08:00.990
<v Speaker 1>particularly about morals and ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without a bit,</v>

170
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.230
<v Speaker 1>but it was all argument disputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a a,</v>

171
00:08:04.231 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 1>a catechism that you had to recite.</v>

172
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a set of beliefs that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have.</v>

173
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>So there was a tradition of disputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the rabbis were famous for,</v>

174
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.240
<v Speaker 1>that the pill pool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hair splitting and,</v>

175
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that was a con contributor as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

176
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 1>but I went to public schools and in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to public schools in Quebec,</v>

177
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:24.974
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my childhood meant you went to </v>

178
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Protestant schools because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>divided along religious lines.</v>

179
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:30.460
<v Speaker 1>There were Protestant schools and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic.</v>

180
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

181
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Protestant meant on Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically everyone else,</v>

182
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>including the Muslims and the Jews and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese and so on.</v>

183
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 1>It was a bizarre system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

184
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.333
<v Speaker 1>How interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happily unconstitutional in this </v>

185
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got,</v>

186
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.843
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually got a pretty serious </v>

187
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Protestant religious education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saying hymns,</v>

188
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.630
<v Speaker 1>we said the Lord's prayer every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned about life of Jesus.</v>

189
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.523
<v Speaker 1>So they had the Jews and the Muslims and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was getting a Protestant </v>

190
00:08:54.571 --> 00:08:54.860
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

191
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at one point I remember I was,</v>

192
00:08:56.331 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

193
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>eight or nine and I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't even belong to a temple.</v>

194
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I said to my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my friends said that,</v>

195
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.413
<v Speaker 1>that Jews aren't supposed to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus my should I not believe in Jesus </v>

196
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:08.154
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She sent me to Hebrew school so fast </v>

197
00:09:09.921 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>that made my head spin hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My teachers,</v>

198
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>because they couldn't hire Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers either.</v>

199
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.333
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and virtually everyone in Quebec is </v>

200
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.230
<v Speaker 1>among the Francophone community are </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholics.</v>

201
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.213
<v Speaker 1>So they actually hired Algerian and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tunisian and Moroccan Jews to teach </v>

202
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:29.710
<v Speaker 1>French to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

203
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.313
<v Speaker 1>Jewish and Protestant kids in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Protestant kids in Montreal did not </v>

204
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:39.321
<v Speaker 1>learn French from Native Quebecois.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We looked at from a Egyptian or Tunisian</v>

205
00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How bizarre it was.</v>

206
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I know the subject of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your next book.</v>

207
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:44.994
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like there's just so much </v>

208
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:48.030
<v Speaker 1>richness to adjusting that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least there's a little,</v>

209
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.370
<v Speaker 1>a little comedy in there.</v>

210
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.303
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like your family was kinda on </v>

211
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:52.764
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least at the county he was in red </v>

212
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.750
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was full of books and magazines.</v>

213
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.673
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:09:58.770 --> 00:09:59.800
<v Speaker 1>my father was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

215
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 1>had a law degree but didn't practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a child.</v>

216
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 1>He was a and handled some little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>real estate and did a sales,</v>

217
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:07.643
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

218
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting a law practice pretty late in </v>

219
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:10.524
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother was like most mothers of the </v>

220
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 1>fifties and sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a homemaker,</v>

221
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.560
<v Speaker 1>but then found a career when she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting bored,</v>

222
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I became a guidance counselor and </v>

223
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 1>then the vice principal of high school </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my mother were Roslyn pinker,</v>

224
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 1>very intellectual and intense reader </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows everything.</v>

225
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 1>A intellectually very engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

226

<v Speaker 1>And my sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Susan is a,</v>

227

<v Speaker 1>on sex differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one on a face to face contact.</v>

230
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 1>My brother Rob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I worked for the Canadian government</v>

231
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 1>for several decades as a policy analyst </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>

233
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.980
<v Speaker 1>So how much of the intellectual pursuits</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you all have,</v>

234
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 1>do you think is his biological versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>just learned experience?</v>

235
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the themes that keeps </v>

236
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:06.370
<v Speaker 1>coming up around these decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

237
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.710
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a,</v>

238
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.633
<v Speaker 1>was a topic of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blank slate in the modern denial of </v>

239
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:11.604
<v Speaker 1>human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blank slate being the metaphor that </v>

240
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:14.964
<v Speaker 1>I argued became dominant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual life largely for political </v>

241
00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:18.654
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you explain that a little bit for </v>

242
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:21.270
<v Speaker 1>the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't know the book?</v>

243
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

244
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.183
<v Speaker 1>the blank slate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern denial of human nature just </v>

245
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:30.140
<v Speaker 1>was released in 2016 with an afterword </v>
<v Speaker 1>was about the idea that,</v>

246
00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:31.014
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is no such thing as human </v>

247
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:32.964
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are blank slates written on by </v>

248
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>our parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

249
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:37.903
<v Speaker 1>by the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a education and that there's no </v>

250
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.800
<v Speaker 1>innate human traits or ways of learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thinking it's,</v>

251
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:45.643
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can program a human however you </v>

252
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:47.890
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

253
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

254
00:11:49.181 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I argued that it was popular in the 20th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century for political reasons.</v>

255
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 1>One of them being that it seems like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate way to achieve equality,</v>

256
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we all,</v>

257
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.260
<v Speaker 1>if we're all zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

258
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>zero equals zero equals zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we all have to be equal,</v>

259
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already,</v>

260
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:05.524
<v Speaker 1>this is a mistake in the book that </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality is really a legal and moral </v>

261
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:09.544
<v Speaker 1>principle to treat everyone equally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really the belief that we're </v>

262
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:12.964
<v Speaker 1>all clones were on blank slates and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the book try to both layout the </v>

263
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:18.244
<v Speaker 1>science of human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to explore the political and </v>

264
00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:26.920
<v Speaker 1>emotional and moral baggage and coloring</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to try to clarify it.</v>

265
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And so the difference between equality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of treatment and the equality of,</v>

266
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.621
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

267
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:33.454
<v Speaker 1>of our biological endowment was a major </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that also of course enters into </v>

268
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:42.590
<v Speaker 1>discussion of sex differences where one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons that certain intellectual</v>

269
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:44.884
<v Speaker 1>factions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain parts of feminism wants to deny </v>

270
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:49.450
<v Speaker 1>that there any sex differences.</v>

271
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.513
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that will make it impossible to </v>

272
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 1>discriminate because there's nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate.</v>

273
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 1>We're all exactly the sport exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

274
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.900
<v Speaker 1>And I get that big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big mistake.</v>

275
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:59.743
<v Speaker 1>There's first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a lot of evidence that men and </v>

276
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:04.050
<v Speaker 1>women aren't identical and all traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

277
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there is a lot of evidence.</v>

278
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

279
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.823
<v Speaker 1>I think anyone who's had a son and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter who has been in a heterosexual </v>

280
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.164
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who's listened to gossip about </v>

281
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 1>anyone talking about anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

282
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Men and women are really not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly the same,</v>

283
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.450
<v Speaker 1>but I think the myth that at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>was introduced for political purposes,</v>

284
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.930
<v Speaker 1>namely that would make discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational,</v>

285
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:26.883
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's nothing to discriminate </v>

286
00:13:28.151 --> 00:13:29.030
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I argue that,</v>

287
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.060
<v Speaker 1>that's just a error in logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

289
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.023
<v Speaker 1>I strongly believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in gender equity that no one should be </v>

290
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:37.810
<v Speaker 1>prejudged because they're a man or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

291
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.853
<v Speaker 1>partly because of a scientific fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's huge overlap between the sexes </v>

292
00:13:42.341 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 1>in any trade you want to look at.</v>

293
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.943
<v Speaker 1>So you can predict an individual's </v>
<v Speaker 1>traits just knowing that they're a man </v>

294
00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:49.000
<v Speaker 1>or a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

295
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.400
<v Speaker 1>the policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be fair.</v>

296
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.790
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't require the false belief that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were the same,</v>

297
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.190
<v Speaker 1>that are distinguishable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the best?</v>

298
00:13:57.191 --> 00:13:58.024
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard any argument for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief that you thought made any sense </v>

299
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:03.640
<v Speaker 1>or you just were which belief for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that,</v>

300
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.730
<v Speaker 1>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these genders are equal?</v>

301
00:14:05.731 --> 00:14:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Like when you must hear this from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>academics,</v>

302
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:08.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

303
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.580
<v Speaker 1>we know that some of this stuff is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught at schools.</v>

304
00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:11.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

305
00:14:11.891 --> 00:14:12.671
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

306
00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:14.470
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's enormous,</v>

307
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.060
<v Speaker 1>enormous overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

308
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

309
00:14:17.311 --> 00:14:19.640
<v Speaker 1>and some of the differences between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexes are,</v>

310
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 1>are pretty small and subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in say,</v>

311
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.530
<v Speaker 1>mathematical ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was one of the most controversial,</v>

312
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims about sex differences or it could</v>

313
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.490
<v Speaker 1>lead to a huge firestorm when Larry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Summers,</v>

314
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:34.324
<v Speaker 1>the president of Harvard mentioned that </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between the sexes might </v>

315
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:38.614
<v Speaker 1>explain why the number of engineering </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors at Harvard and mit wasn't 50 </v>

316
00:14:43.661 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 1>slash 50 down the line.</v>

317
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.603
<v Speaker 1>Male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>

318
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.770
<v Speaker 1>This is very much like the James divorce</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation with,</v>

319
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.150
<v Speaker 1>with Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

320
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.050
<v Speaker 1>is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

321
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.010
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost a replay and uh,</v>

322
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't easy.</v>

323
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.313
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be hard to say that men or </v>

324
00:14:58.791 --> 00:14:59.624
<v Speaker 1>women are better at math in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you have to even drill down to </v>

325
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:02.774
<v Speaker 1>certain subcomponents like mentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotating three dimensional objects that </v>

326
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.880
<v Speaker 1>men are clearly better at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but women are better at,</v>

327
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.050
<v Speaker 1>at our word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems in arithmetic and math.</v>

328
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.273
<v Speaker 1>So it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of the pushback is that in fact </v>

329
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:16.184
<v Speaker 1>the science is often complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make a sweeping across the </v>

330
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:19.664
<v Speaker 1>board generalization and then the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of push back for people who defend </v>

331
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 1>the blank slate as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

332
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 1>that's true of 2002 when your book came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

333
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.110
<v Speaker 1>but a society is changing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

334
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:32.953
<v Speaker 1>more women are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are consuming porn and more women are </v>

335
00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 1>having multiple sexual partners and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the differences saying sexuality,</v>

336
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are due to human nature,</v>

337
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.613
<v Speaker 1>but just due to our culture at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular moment that may become </v>

338
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:46.724
<v Speaker 1>obsolete.</v>

339
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.760
<v Speaker 1>And that seems incredibly dangerous to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me to view it that way.</v>

340
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

341
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although,</v>

342
00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:53.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

343
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 1>in some ways it's actually highway a </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive and even correct because you</v>

344
00:15:57.861 --> 00:15:59.060
<v Speaker 1>could have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:15:59.061 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 1>70 years ago a women don't want to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the professions.</v>

346
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:03.610
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

347
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.870
<v Speaker 1>they want to stay home with the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Housework,</v>

348
00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:06.704
<v Speaker 1>and that's what makes them complete and </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied and happy and there'll be all </v>

349
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.560
<v Speaker 1>a neurotic and anxious if they start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become lawyers and doctors.</v>

350
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.490
<v Speaker 1>And we know from the course of history </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

351
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

352
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.790
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went as soon as the doors open,</v>

353
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 1>women did pour through the doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

354
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:23.054
<v Speaker 1>and so that would be an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were too strong a claim of biological </v>

355
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 1>differences would have been refuted by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the facts of history.</v>

356
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a slam dunk.</v>

357
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.933
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is something that has to be examined </v>

358
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:34.004
<v Speaker 1>on a case by case basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you shocked at how difficult it is </v>

359
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 1>to talk about all of this without </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting yourself yourself or,</v>

360
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 1>or any of the people that talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into hot water?</v>

361
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuance that you have to go through here.</v>

362
00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:47.101
<v Speaker 1>As I can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

363
00:16:47.101 --> 00:16:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you're quite well versed that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the best at it.</v>

364
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.533
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot to make sure that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>can pinpoint that one line that then </v>

365
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 1>they're going to just drag you for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

366
00:16:57.081 --> 00:16:57.711
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

367
00:16:57.711 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that I wrote the blank </v>
<v Speaker 1>slate was it wasn't so much,</v>

368
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.833
<v Speaker 1>it's a chapter on gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point wasn't just to review the </v>

369
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:06.860
<v Speaker 1>literature on gender differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also to say,</v>

370
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.053
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

371
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.580
<v Speaker 1>how does it matter for our public </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates?</v>

372
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And I also documented in the book how </v>
<v Speaker 1>even when the book first came out,</v>

373
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.143
<v Speaker 1>there was a history of people being deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>platformed and it down and called know </v>

374
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.850
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of nasty names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

375
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.033
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the view that we're not blank </v>

376
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 1>slates.</v>

377
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.741
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

378
00:17:27.741 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 1>this is based on emotion based on bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

379
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:34.730
<v Speaker 1>not based on the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of,</v>

380
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I want to say defended </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

381
00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but I laid out all of these political </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversies.</v>

382
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.720
<v Speaker 1>So I wasn't blundering into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naive.</v>

383
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:42.554
<v Speaker 1>I was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was actually the subject of the </v>

384
00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>book sometimes though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that can't fully defend you.</v>

385
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>And in fact both Larry Summers and Jamie</v>
<v Speaker 1>to more,</v>

386
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.953
<v Speaker 1>they almost could have taken their </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches and in case in the case of </v>

387
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Larry Summers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly did from the chapter on gender in</v>

388
00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 1>the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I managed to escape some trouble that</v>

389
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.650
<v Speaker 1>people who have been repeated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments got into trouble for.</v>

390
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting.</v>

391
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 1>You sort of laid out a case beforehand </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

392
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.773
<v Speaker 1>to defend yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did like sort of a preemptive </v>

393
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:12.600
<v Speaker 1>strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly where someone,</v>

394
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 1>both of those guys.</v>

395
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I know James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know James personally and he's been in</v>

396
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.094
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like he sort of stumbled into </v>

397
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 1>this thing and then the reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it sort of,</v>

398
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.473
<v Speaker 1>it just becomes this bigger beast that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up fighting when you were just </v>

399
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 1>really trying to talk about science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the science,</v>

400
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:29.814
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't just talking about the science </v>

401
00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 1>because I was talking about first the </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

402
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Then what are the political and moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>implications,</v>

403
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.623
<v Speaker 1>which I thought got confused feeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>back on people trying to shoehorn the </v>

404
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:41.694
<v Speaker 1>science into a politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>position because they were kind of lazy </v>

405
00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:45.954
<v Speaker 1>when it came to the politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in obviously I don't </v>

406
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:50.280
<v Speaker 1>believe in discrimination against </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>

407
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

408
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.073
<v Speaker 1>but the point being that having that </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief doesn't mean that you have to </v>

409
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:55.494
<v Speaker 1>insist that were blank slates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I made that argument for other </v>

410
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.620
<v Speaker 1>controversies around human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

411
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 1>do we have any violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

412
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:06.720
<v Speaker 1>impulses where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

413
00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of political argument for</v>
<v Speaker 1>different reasons.</v>

414
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.590
<v Speaker 1>And then people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

415
00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:11.424
<v Speaker 1>if we're innately violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're kind of doomed to war for </v>

416
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.550
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you try to reduce war,</v>

417
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:18.384
<v Speaker 1>you're just some romantic piece neck and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hopeless and more as in human </v>

418
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:23.010
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

419
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.660
<v Speaker 1>since war is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

420
00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.230
<v Speaker 1>and if we're violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll always have war.</v>

421
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:31.650
<v Speaker 1>We can't be violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I invest is a logical.</v>

422
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 1>We do have violent impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's pretty clear,</v>

423
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's not all we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also have a,</v>

424
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.700
<v Speaker 1>have the faculty of self control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also have empathy.</v>

425
00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 1>We have cognitive processes of problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>solving,</v>

426
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can figure out how we can reduce </v>

427
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:48.540
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got moral norms.</v>

428
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 1>There are just certain things you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

429
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.503
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that part of us as violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean we're doomed to violence </v>

430
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.450
<v Speaker 1>because part of us pushes back on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

431
00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:58.323
<v Speaker 1>Once I cited a statistic that three </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters of men and 60 percent of women </v>

432
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.940
<v Speaker 1>at least once it had a homicidal </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy,</v>

433
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.680
<v Speaker 1>imagined killing someone.</v>

434
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't like three quarters of men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 60 percent of task.</v>

435
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

436
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I,</v>

437
00:20:14.131 --> 00:20:14.964
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I introduced this factor electronic and </v>

438
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:16.891
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

439
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:17.724
<v Speaker 1>what does this tell us about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature tells us that three quarters of </v>

440
00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:22.830
<v Speaker 1>men are liars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

441
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I pointed out this,</v>

442
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.473
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't mean that trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase piece is futile because there </v>

443
00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:31.830
<v Speaker 1>are other parts of human nature we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>work with.</v>

444
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.350
<v Speaker 1>And of course that was what led to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>more recent book,</v>

445
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.450
<v Speaker 1>the better angels of our nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>

446
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.180
<v Speaker 1>not only is it possible it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

447
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:39.890
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

448
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:40.723
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of the nexus between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political on the one hand and the </v>

449
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:47.070
<v Speaker 1>scientific on the other that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring.</v>

450
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.913
<v Speaker 1>And I talked about how the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they were advocates of peace </v>

451
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 1>tried to squash all evidence that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a violent,</v>

452
00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:57.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses because it was just politically</v>

453
00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 1>too uncomfortable.</v>

454
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.720
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's first of all,</v>

455
00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 1>distorting the science is never a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

456
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And is it clear about the politics then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the science doesn't even mean that we've</v>

457
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:08.470
<v Speaker 1>got to accept war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

458
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.280
<v Speaker 1>So for someone that's sort of insulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves from some of this,</v>

459
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 1>because you were doing the work </v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand,</v>

460
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:16.270
<v Speaker 1>which is actually pretty brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactic.</v>

461
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.493
<v Speaker 1>Are you afraid that the hard sciences </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be hit by all of this </v>

462
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:21.784
<v Speaker 1>identity politics stuff in a bigger way </v>
<v Speaker 1>than we're seeing right now when it </v>

463
00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:27.580
<v Speaker 1>comes to gender or race or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or any of these issues?</v>

464
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not even so much the hard sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the social sciences,</v>

465
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 1>well we know the social science happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>

466
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 1>but you don't fear that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from the hard sciences to,</v>

467
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.463
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there may be some aspects of </v>

468
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 1>genetics and brain science that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

469
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.460
<v Speaker 1>that are feeling the political pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neuroscience of sex differences,</v>

470
00:21:45.461 --> 00:21:46.294
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

471
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.533
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly the genetics of intelligence </v>

472
00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:53.770
<v Speaker 1>and personality have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have felt that political pressure.</v>

473
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

474
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

475
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.890
<v Speaker 1>one of my collaborators and former </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

476
00:21:57.891 --> 00:22:02.891
<v Speaker 1>So James Lee presented a paper where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's part of the consortium that for the</v>

477
00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:08.491
<v Speaker 1>first time identified number of genes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were linked to intelligence.</v>

478
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no icu gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are hundreds,</v>

479
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.693
<v Speaker 1>probably thousands of genes that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>bump your icu up by a fraction of a </v>

480
00:22:16.811 --> 00:22:17.644
<v Speaker 1>point up or down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have been some of the first </v>

481
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:21.394
<v Speaker 1>really hard replicable discoveries </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are a lot of bogus </v>

482
00:22:24.341 --> 00:22:27.340
<v Speaker 1>discoveries in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this was really solid and there was,</v>

483
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.930
<v Speaker 1>there was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty big pushback,</v>

484
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.110
<v Speaker 1>including from the president of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>society saying,</v>

485
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:32.920
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

486
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.160
<v Speaker 1>is this fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is unacceptable.</v>

487
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was some pushback and this was,</v>

488
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.273
<v Speaker 1>this was genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make of the people that </v>

489
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 1>focus on like race and Iq?</v>

490
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:43.721
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

491
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had Stefan Molyneux here.</v>

492
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

493
00:22:46.681 --> 00:22:47.514
<v Speaker 1>he really focuses on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted what I wanted to know from </v>

494
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:55.040
<v Speaker 1>him really was not necessarily why it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really not.</v>

495
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.290
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why the focus on that,</v>

496
00:22:58.291 --> 00:22:59.290
<v Speaker 1>that team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

497
00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:00.820
<v Speaker 1>that's the part I'm more concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

498
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>

499
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an excellent question and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one that,</v>

500
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:06.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

501
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>torments me.</v>

502
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.673
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand you could make the </v>

503
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:10.840
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

504
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.710
<v Speaker 1>we should not be afraid of the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for that matter of vigorous,</v>

505
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.150
<v Speaker 1>a exploration of the genetics of racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences might show that there are no</v>

506
00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:19.984
<v Speaker 1>genetic differences relevant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality or intelligence and that </v>

507
00:23:22.181 --> 00:23:24.250
<v Speaker 1>would give races have a really decisive </v>
<v Speaker 1>blow.</v>

508
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.950
<v Speaker 1>But the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never know that before you look.</v>

509
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.930
<v Speaker 1>So you can't count on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've of course,</v>

510
00:23:28.931 --> 00:23:29.764
<v Speaker 1>if you do science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to be prepared for any </v>

511
00:23:30.731 --> 00:23:32.080
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

512
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:32.914
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a legitimate question of whether we </v>

513
00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 1>really should be getting to the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>

514
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It's an argument that actually goes back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my old mit colleague,</v>

515
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Noam Chomsky way back in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies said,</v>

516
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.083
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't insist that the truth one way </v>

517
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 1>or another because that's just contrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the whole spirit of science.</v>

518
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.573
<v Speaker 1>But we don't have to ask every question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of questions that are </v>

519
00:23:51.651 --> 00:23:52.484
<v Speaker 1>scientifically pretty minor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could have socially damaging </v>

520
00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's put them really low on the list</v>

521
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.470
<v Speaker 1>and he suggested that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

522
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:02.840
<v Speaker 1>that racing Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

523
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:03.913
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should not be an interest in a society </v>

524
00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:06.764
<v Speaker 1>that treats people as individuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then it's just like a </v>

525
00:24:08.631 --> 00:24:11.360
<v Speaker 1>correlation between any two traits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

526
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

527
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:16.130
<v Speaker 1>that we should just be a low priority </v>
<v Speaker 1>and something that we should ignore.</v>

528
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

529
00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.053
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it ignores the fact that there </v>

530
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:23.084
<v Speaker 1>are people who already are dividing </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans by race and by measuring the </v>

531
00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:32.210
<v Speaker 1>outcomes and attributing it to poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>or racism.</v>

532
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 1>And then you kind of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

533
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.041
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

534
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:36.380
<v Speaker 1>as long as we were raising the question </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

535
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.393
<v Speaker 1>should we look at all the hypotheses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might even be an argument for just </v>

536
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:42.260
<v Speaker 1>downplaying race in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

537
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 1>instead of dividing us up by race and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessive measuring the differences,</v>

538
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at things like class and </v>
<v Speaker 1>income because that that's really what,</v>

539
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:52.363
<v Speaker 1>what matters more and just not make </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything a racial issue in the first </v>

540
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:56.024
<v Speaker 1>place so that whether the racial issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>is from biology kind of fades and </v>

541
00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:00.540
<v Speaker 1>importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

542
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned the nexus of politics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

543
00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:04.574
<v Speaker 1>I really like that phrase because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's so many of the </v>

544
00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 1>conversations I'm having here.</v>

545
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:08.323
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that politics and science</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really just linked all the time and </v>

546
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:15.890
<v Speaker 1>it explains why so many people want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you and why they want to talk to</v>

547
00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:18.710
<v Speaker 1>the Weinstein brothers and Sam Harris </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so many other people.</v>

548
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Are you a little concerned that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming so political?</v>

549
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

550
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.510
<v Speaker 1>part of it is that it's that what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

551
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.503
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing and what some of the </v>

552
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:29.294
<v Speaker 1>other your other guests have been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to try to depoliticize some of the </v>

553
00:25:31.521 --> 00:25:32.354
<v Speaker 1>scientific issues and certainly what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to do in the blank slate or </v>

554
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:40.290
<v Speaker 1>clarify what the political issues are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

555
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.370
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible these days right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

556
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.120
<v Speaker 1>it is becoming a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

557
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.223
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

558
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.020
<v Speaker 1>the landscape is really diverse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>divided.</v>

559
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are the very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the identity politicians in the social </v>

560
00:25:52.281 --> 00:25:56.750
<v Speaker 1>justice warriors and the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness police who are making things</v>

561
00:25:56.751 --> 00:25:58.040
<v Speaker 1>as political as possible.</v>

562
00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.083
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'd been around for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time when I was a student in the </v>

563
00:26:00.561 --> 00:26:01.394
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were plenty of people who are </v>

564
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.910
<v Speaker 1>shouting things like fascists don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to speak or chanting mobs that</v>

565
00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:08.744
<v Speaker 1>shut down a Harvard colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eo Wilson when he published </v>

566
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:14.030
<v Speaker 1>sociobiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this isn't a new thing.</v>

567
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.163
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are certainly constituencies </v>

568
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.133
<v Speaker 1>that are totally opened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>depoliticizing the science and </v>

569
00:26:21.651 --> 00:26:23.570
<v Speaker 1>considering the politics on its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

570
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:24.643
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a fringe that appears to be </v>

571
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:28.170
<v Speaker 1>more radical than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

572
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.040
<v Speaker 1>How do you decide how much weight that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fringe has?</v>

573
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:32.750
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be one of the themes these</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

574
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:33.603
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be very hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this just this small group that's </v>

575
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:39.920
<v Speaker 1>screaming a lot or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or has it truly infected?</v>

576
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Not only a ton of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

577
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.670
<v Speaker 1>the millennial generation and had a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>swath of young people,</v>

578
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:45.683
<v Speaker 1>but that also it does seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>creeping up or creeping down depending </v>

579
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:48.864
<v Speaker 1>on which way you look at it.</v>

580
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.110
<v Speaker 1>A ton of academics at universities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of,</v>

581
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.780
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of other people that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have power.</v>

582
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.003
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the academics have been </v>

583
00:26:58.261 --> 00:27:00.290
<v Speaker 1>distorted for quite some time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

584
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.690
<v Speaker 1>and this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

585
00:27:01.691 --> 00:27:02.524
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea that's been pushed by Jonathan </v>

586
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Heit tetlock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jose Duarte.</v>

587
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of stern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a,</v>

588
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.300
<v Speaker 1>a pretty widely discussed article that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

589
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:13.303
<v Speaker 1>the title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like viewpoint diversity will </v>

590
00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 1>help social science with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave a number of cases,</v>

591
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.293
<v Speaker 1>some of which I had discussed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blank slate of how just the questions </v>

592
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.283
<v Speaker 1>that a psychologist ask the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the items they put on their </v>

593
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:25.884
<v Speaker 1>questionnaires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they frame issues just clearly </v>

594
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:33.900
<v Speaker 1>has a left wing bias that they argued </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if there were also people,</v>

595
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:38.730
<v Speaker 1>conservatives in more of them in psych </v>
<v Speaker 1>departments than they would have pointed</v>

596
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:39.300
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

597
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.133
<v Speaker 1>your questionnaire is flawed and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual quality of the science would </v>

598
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:44.160
<v Speaker 1>improved.</v>

599
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.800
<v Speaker 1>And to the credit of my field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

600
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.790
<v Speaker 1>there are paper was published in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>journal where there are 30 commentaries,</v>

601
00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:55.200
<v Speaker 1>so 30 people had a chance to go after </v>
<v Speaker 1>them or teams.</v>

602
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:56.370
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

603
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.110
<v Speaker 1>there was disagreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was very respectful.</v>

604
00:27:58.111 --> 00:28:02.130
<v Speaker 1>They weren't call any nasty names and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a really good debate.</v>

605
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

606
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.210
<v Speaker 1>the question that you asked about how is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

607
00:28:06.211 --> 00:28:07.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the,</v>

608
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.123
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

609
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.083
<v Speaker 1>totally illiberal and radical movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that just shouting down </v>

610
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:17.460
<v Speaker 1>speakers sometimes physically assault </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

611
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.283
<v Speaker 1>Is that the whole millennial generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>or is that just a increasingly vocal </v>

612
00:28:22.681 --> 00:28:23.960
<v Speaker 1>fringe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

613
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.993
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind was changed just a couple of </v>

614
00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 1>days ago when I read an article in vox </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a new study,</v>

615
00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.110
<v Speaker 1>a Sam Harris had center to me saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually support for free speech is</v>

616
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.003
<v Speaker 1>increasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the article you saw the </v>

617
00:28:36.961 --> 00:28:38.860
<v Speaker 1>article so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

618
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 1>that I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of surprised.</v>

619
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:41.843
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't totally shocked because at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least my experience at Harvard is that </v>

620
00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:46.410
<v Speaker 1>the students are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

621
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.590
<v Speaker 1>all the ones that I've interacted with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admittedly a biased sample,</v>

622
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.650
<v Speaker 1>but they are perfectly supportive of </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>

623
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.030
<v Speaker 1>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>

624
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

625
00:28:55.141 --> 00:28:56.090
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

626
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.270
<v Speaker 1>right before we started that I spoke at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard through the open issues,</v>

627
00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a wonderful group and I,</v>

628
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.780
<v Speaker 1>and it was clear that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically diverse and,</v>

629
00:29:03.781 --> 00:29:06.240
<v Speaker 1>and all the other diversity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone likes,</v>

630
00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:07.680
<v Speaker 1>but that I don't care about that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

631
00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards we went to a dinner and there</v>

632
00:29:10.651 --> 00:29:13.710
<v Speaker 1>were about 30 or 40 kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with Bret Weinstein actually.</v>

633
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.050
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked them like,</v>

634
00:29:16.051 --> 00:29:16.884
<v Speaker 1>what do you guys do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you guys okay with saying what you </v>

635
00:29:18.781 --> 00:29:19.614
<v Speaker 1>think and do you think it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt your grades or hurt your </v>

636
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:23.610
<v Speaker 1>friendship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And virtually everyone said yes.</v>

637
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.240
<v Speaker 1>So I'm still struggling with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I did read it.</v>

638
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.560
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said yeah,</v>

639
00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.730
<v Speaker 1>we would either hurt them or they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost friends.</v>

640
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:30.933
<v Speaker 1>Mostly I sent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them were kind of libertarian </v>

641
00:29:33.061 --> 00:29:34.680
<v Speaker 1>ish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of live and let live.</v>

642
00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.060
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly not all of them,</v>

643
00:29:36.061 --> 00:29:38.850
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but virtually everyone at the table said</v>

644
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 1>that they either were afraid to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things,</v>

645
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.943
<v Speaker 1>friends or certainly two professors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why when I read the articles </v>

646
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 1>like that at box and I go to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses and I hear this consistently,</v>

647
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.383
<v Speaker 1>it's just hard to grade and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly why I'm posing the </v>

648
00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:52.980
<v Speaker 1>question to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

649
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just hard to pin this article was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

650
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.540
<v Speaker 1>was an eye opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

651
00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.900
<v Speaker 1>went against the narrative that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>millennial generation,</v>

652
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:03.880
<v Speaker 1>are they a bunch of snowflakes that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of,</v>

653
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.073
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

654
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.230
<v Speaker 1>cultural revolutionaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors.</v>

655
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

656
00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there certainly is that faction,</v>

657
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.360
<v Speaker 1>but it may not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

658
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.110
<v Speaker 1>characterize our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our era altogether.</v>

659
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you thought at all about how much </v>

660
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:21.570
<v Speaker 1>social media is a piece of this puzzle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

661
00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

662
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays everything is blamed on social </v>

663
00:30:24.941 --> 00:30:26.400
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like,</v>

664
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the role of El Nino and then nine </v>

665
00:30:28.831 --> 00:30:30.380
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

666
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.640
<v Speaker 1>That was all my space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

667
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:34.950
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

668
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of this I think,</v>

669
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.040
<v Speaker 1>predated social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

670
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:41.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cable news networks had,</v>

671
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.260
<v Speaker 1>had a role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

672
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Fox News in particular because it was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicized,</v>

673
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that no previous network really</v>

674
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.713
<v Speaker 1>had been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are studies showing that when </v>

675
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.863
<v Speaker 1>a town gets Fox News and you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural experiment because some </v>

676
00:30:56.411 --> 00:30:57.244
<v Speaker 1>towns got it before others just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the way cable companies offered </v>

677
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:01.510
<v Speaker 1>different packages for no particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

678
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:02.783
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell the towns that got Fox </v>

679
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.830
<v Speaker 1>News became more polarized and became a </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shifted to the right.</v>

680
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:09.933
<v Speaker 1>So it really did have a causal effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one case where it's not just </v>

681
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:12.990
<v Speaker 1>correlational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

682
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:14.860
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a strange,</v>

683
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.760
<v Speaker 1>a moment about a month or two ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about two months ago now,</v>

684
00:31:18.761 --> 00:31:19.594
<v Speaker 1>were you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said something to the effect of you </v>

685
00:31:21.481 --> 00:31:22.314
<v Speaker 1>when someone asks you a question at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>panel about the alt right and in and in </v>

686
00:31:25.181 --> 00:31:28.230
<v Speaker 1>effect you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to put words in mouth.</v>

687
00:31:28.231 --> 00:31:28.491
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

688
00:31:28.491 --> 00:31:29.321
<v Speaker 1>what did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

689
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:30.154
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to butcher open campus </v>

690
00:31:31.061 --> 00:31:31.820
<v Speaker 1>initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

691
00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.080
<v Speaker 1>it was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the ones that are.</v>

692
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:34.931
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

693
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:36.990
<v Speaker 1>So I know this is a good group of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were sitting with.</v>

694
00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.110
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

695
00:31:38.111 --> 00:31:39.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>topic of the event was,</v>

696
00:31:39.371 --> 00:31:42.220
<v Speaker 1>did political correctness help elect </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump?</v>

697
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.650
<v Speaker 1>It was held almost on the anniversary of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

698
00:31:44.651 --> 00:31:45.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 election.</v>

699
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:47.223
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suggest that I thought it did in part </v>

700
00:31:49.271 --> 00:31:50.540
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

701
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:54.040
<v Speaker 1>when you have certain ideas that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not discussable,</v>

702
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:55.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

703
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.010
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on campus,</v>

704
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.903
<v Speaker 1>and you've got a savvy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interconnected community as the </v>

705
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:01.780
<v Speaker 1>original.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

706
00:32:01.781 --> 00:32:06.460
<v Speaker 1>where a lot of people associate alt </v>
<v Speaker 1>right with the torch carrying skinheads.</v>

707
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.533
<v Speaker 1>But what I had in mind was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the term as it originally applied to </v>

708
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:12.950
<v Speaker 1>internet discussion groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

709
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:14.310
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

710
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:15.463
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the danger of restricting debate on a </v>

711
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.033
<v Speaker 1>campus of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of making certain ideas taboo is that </v>

712
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:24.610
<v Speaker 1>when smart people do stumble upon them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they are,</v>

713
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.553
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a completely alienated from the </v>

714
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.520
<v Speaker 1>mainstream intellectual life because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

715
00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:33.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a truth that they can't handle a</v>

716
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.670
<v Speaker 1>what other truths can't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

717
00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.813
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the ideas never get the kind of </v>

718
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.753
<v Speaker 1>push back and contextualize nation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter-arguments kind of thing that </v>

719
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:45.464
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want for any idea never </v>

720
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:47.390
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

721
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:48.223
<v Speaker 1>And within this likeminded community </v>
<v Speaker 1>they sometimes jump to the most extreme </v>

722
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 1>conclusions because it's sort of a self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a self fulfilling prophecy of sewers.</v>

723
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an example being gender differences,</v>

724
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 1>if it's taboo even to mention the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that men and women differ,</v>

725
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.380
<v Speaker 1>then you stumble across some pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific evidence that they do a,</v>

726
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.560
<v Speaker 1>then you might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

727
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

728
00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:09.920
<v Speaker 1>we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should,</v>

729
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.753
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have fewer women in medical school </v>

730
00:33:12.081 --> 00:33:13.880
<v Speaker 1>because they just going to drop out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have babies.</v>

731
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

732
00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.160
<v Speaker 1>that's a totally idiotic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

733
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.213
<v Speaker 1>but the reason that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he could put forward an idiotic </v>

734
00:33:20.811 --> 00:33:24.860
<v Speaker 1>idea is that since the whole existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sex differences never discussed,</v>

735
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 1>no one ever said that's an idiotic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And likewise,</v>

736
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:29.083
<v Speaker 1>and there are a number of other facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are kind of undiscussable that you </v>

737
00:33:32.151 --> 00:33:35.180
<v Speaker 1>can take to extreme conclusions if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not challenged.</v>

738
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you bring them out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>

739
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:42.370
<v Speaker 1>then you can put them into perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunlight is the best disinfectant and in</v>

740
00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:43.214
<v Speaker 1>many cases it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is that the rates of </v>

741
00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 1>crime differ between blacks and whites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

742
00:33:48.831 --> 00:33:51.290
<v Speaker 1>if that's a fact that's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>undiscussable,</v>

743
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:53.340
<v Speaker 1>but just go to FBI.gov.</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up.</v>

744
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:57.890
<v Speaker 1>They break down rates of a of a crime by</v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

745
00:33:57.891 --> 00:33:58.850
<v Speaker 1>by race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by state,</v>

746
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:00.530
<v Speaker 1>and you know there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

747
00:34:00.531 --> 00:34:05.531
<v Speaker 1>if you have never even noticed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can say,</v>

748
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.493
<v Speaker 1>Oh gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you know African Americans </v>

749
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:08.403
<v Speaker 1>are innately more violent than white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's completely wrong because we know </v>

750
00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:12.374
<v Speaker 1>that no two ethnic groups ever have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same crime rate and they can shift over </v>

751
00:34:16.311 --> 00:34:17.144
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be the Irish that were the </v>

752
00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:23.170
<v Speaker 1>that had sky high rates of violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to a non Irish and we know that</v>

753
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:26.300
<v Speaker 1>that vanished over time and the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>white differences might as well,</v>

754
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:31.100
<v Speaker 1>but that second fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely ethnic and racial differences are</v>

755
00:34:31.101 --> 00:34:33.050
<v Speaker 1>ubiquitous and they can change with </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

756
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.393
<v Speaker 1>We'll never even get mentioned if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mere fact that there is a difference is </v>

757
00:34:37.551 --> 00:34:39.860
<v Speaker 1>unmentionable in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was my argument.</v>

758
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I gave some other examples anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

759
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.593
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's a doctored film clip on </v>

760
00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:47.360
<v Speaker 1>some outright sites saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

761
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:50.210
<v Speaker 1>see pinker's saying that the operators </v>
<v Speaker 1>is correct.</v>

762
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.220
<v Speaker 1>That is actually saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we,</v>

763
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.160
<v Speaker 1>how can we starve the offer right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

764
00:34:55.161 --> 00:34:55.611
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

765
00:34:55.611 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

766
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.690
<v Speaker 1>we're feeding them inadvertently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were basically,</v>

767
00:34:59.691 --> 00:35:00.524
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the layman that's watching </v>

768
00:35:01.221 --> 00:35:01.551
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

769
00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:02.384
<v Speaker 1>you were basically saying allow for more</v>
<v Speaker 1>information so that those bad ideas </v>

770
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:08.630
<v Speaker 1>won't be able to flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

771
00:35:08.631 --> 00:35:11.660
<v Speaker 1>that is sort of one o one version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the whole point.</v>

772
00:35:11.661 --> 00:35:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it was,</v>

773
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:13.903
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

774
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:19.150
<v Speaker 1>edited to leave out that parts and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of regressive left picked up on</v>

775
00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:20.834
<v Speaker 1>it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to also suggest that I was sympathetic </v>

776
00:35:22.671 --> 00:35:23.504
<v Speaker 1>to the alt right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is most bizarre attribution you </v>

777
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:27.050
<v Speaker 1>could imagine.</v>

778
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.260
<v Speaker 1>And indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment now has a whole chapter on</v>

779
00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:31.220
<v Speaker 1>why the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

780
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:33.030
<v Speaker 1>the alt right is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

781
00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:37.580
<v Speaker 1>it has gone off the off the rails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

782
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.820
<v Speaker 1>this misconception after a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>days after the day was corrected,</v>

783
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 1>both in the New York Times and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guardian in England,</v>

784
00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:46.923
<v Speaker 1>I may.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came to my defense and set things </v>

785
00:35:48.451 --> 00:35:50.250
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't bizarre.</v>

786
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:54.450
<v Speaker 1>A episode of how has the Times putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>social media makes you stupid.</v>

787
00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

788
00:35:56.281 --> 00:35:57.640
<v Speaker 1>so I do want to spend our whole second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

789
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.853
<v Speaker 1>Talking about the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very quickly just when you dealt </v>

790
00:36:00.481 --> 00:36:02.400
<v Speaker 1>with that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I remember reading it and I think</v>

791
00:36:02.401 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 1>there was something in an odd way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reaction between,</v>

792
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:07.900
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regressive left and the right,</v>

793
00:36:07.901 --> 00:36:09.360
<v Speaker 1>that they were sort of teaming up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

794
00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was in a weird way,</v>

795
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:13.794
<v Speaker 1>even though I know it probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally for you is no fun and you </v>

796
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:18.920
<v Speaker 1>probably had all sorts of people saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things to you and all,</v>

797
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.793
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

798
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.233
<v Speaker 1>That I thought if anyone has read any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen's books or even remotely knows </v>

799
00:36:24.961 --> 00:36:25.794
<v Speaker 1>what this guy is doing that I think I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what you consider yourself </v>

800
00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:29.034
<v Speaker 1>politically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You strike me as sort of an old school </v>

801
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:31.900
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

802
00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting out there that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>centrist moderate,</v>

803
00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:35.634
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have sympathies to different policies </v>

804
00:36:37.411 --> 00:36:38.310
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

805
00:36:38.311 --> 00:36:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty eclectic and centrist.</v>

806
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

807
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:41.743
<v Speaker 1>that basically I thought this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously just decent and coming at </v>

808
00:36:44.881 --> 00:36:45.714
<v Speaker 1>this from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a scientific perspective that if </v>

809
00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:49.340
<v Speaker 1>this is what they're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where at,</v>

810
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.480
<v Speaker 1>where you say one line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to destroy.</v>

811
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean really my feeling was he could </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy,</v>

812
00:36:55.511 --> 00:36:56.344
<v Speaker 1>like the fabric of society really if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>just start picking off everybody and </v>

813
00:36:59.491 --> 00:37:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of instances of this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

814
00:37:01.561 --> 00:37:02.394
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I've talked to when I've talked to </v>

815
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.733
<v Speaker 1>or I've talked to Bret Weinstein or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Shepherd from Lori a up in </v>

816
00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Canada and a few others that they.</v>

817
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.343
<v Speaker 1>But I thought yours was just such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of this is so ridiculous as </v>

818
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps there was a nice push back to</v>

819
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:16.660
<v Speaker 1>it maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

820
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.780
<v Speaker 1>that was exactly the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

821
00:37:18.781 --> 00:37:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why they titled the op Ed.</v>

822
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that Jesse Singal,</v>

823
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.380
<v Speaker 1>how social media makes them stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

824
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.153
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the book right here in </v>

825
00:37:28.261 --> 00:37:29.580
<v Speaker 1>front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enlightenment.</v>

826
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:30.414
<v Speaker 1>Now I've been kicking around this phrase</v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter that's called a little </v>

827
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:33.714
<v Speaker 1>traction that we are now in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened because it seems like we're </v>

828
00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:40.870
<v Speaker 1>in this endless stream of constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidity and I,</v>

829
00:37:40.871 --> 00:37:41.704
<v Speaker 1>and some of it seems social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>related and we touched a little bit on </v>

830
00:37:44.251 --> 00:37:45.570
<v Speaker 1>that in part one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I'm saying it,</v>

831
00:37:45.571 --> 00:37:46.404
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it a little tongue in cheek </v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually this book is sort of the </v>

832
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.023
<v Speaker 1>answer to I think what I'm calling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment that there are so many </v>

833
00:37:53.551 --> 00:37:57.150
<v Speaker 1>good things happening right now and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very hopeful and optimistic.</v>

834
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.130
<v Speaker 1>And I always tell people I'm an </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimist,</v>

835
00:37:59.131 --> 00:38:01.110
<v Speaker 1>otherwise I couldn't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

836
00:38:01.111 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that there's a chance we can make</v>

837
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:05.970
<v Speaker 1>things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first off,</v>

838
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.670
<v Speaker 1>let's just do some one on one stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

839
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Speaker 1>what our enlightenment values to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

840
00:38:10.651 --> 00:38:11.484
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I characterize them in the subtitle of </v>

841
00:38:13.471 --> 00:38:18.471
<v Speaker 1>book as reason science humanism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress reason that we should,</v>

842
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:21.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze our situation,</v>

843
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:22.524
<v Speaker 1>our predicament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a using the most rigorous a logic that </v>

844
00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:29.670
<v Speaker 1>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And rather than relying on dogma,</v>

845
00:38:29.671 --> 00:38:31.260
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>

846
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:35.800
<v Speaker 1>scripture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going for social media advocacy,</v>

847
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.933
<v Speaker 1>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although at least throwing ideas out </v>

848
00:38:38.591 --> 00:38:41.140
<v Speaker 1>there as long as they get evaluated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as they had criticized,</v>

849
00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.253
<v Speaker 1>I'm a science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that namely that we should test our </v>

850
00:38:46.571 --> 00:38:47.404
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seat deep explanations and that science </v>

851
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:54.520
<v Speaker 1>provides us not just with a gadgets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cures for disease,</v>

852
00:38:54.521 --> 00:38:56.080
<v Speaker 1>although it's important that it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

853
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 1>but also defines our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our human condition,</v>

854
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.100
<v Speaker 1>that concepts from science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like evolution,</v>

855
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.980
<v Speaker 1>like entropy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the whole naturalistic world view,</v>

856
00:39:05.981 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 1>that the laws of nature do their thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>without caring about us.</v>

857
00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:14.730
<v Speaker 1>These are things that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand as the most basic facts about</v>

858
00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:16.564
<v Speaker 1>our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So science is has to be part of our </v>

859
00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:19.444
<v Speaker 1>world to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then humanism is the idea that it's </v>

860
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:26.340
<v Speaker 1>human beings and other sentient animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>that deserve our,</v>

861
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.223
<v Speaker 1>our our moral concern as opposed to they</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the glory of the tribe or following </v>

862
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.203
<v Speaker 1>a caring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious dictates or the faith or some </v>

863
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.840
<v Speaker 1>messianic age that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do people live long,</v>

864
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:41.740
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>

865
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 1>stimulating lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we should care about.</v>

866
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.550
<v Speaker 1>And then progress is that if we use </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason and science to make people better</v>

867
00:39:48.551 --> 00:39:50.440
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe we can gradually succeed.</v>

868
00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's funny when I,</v>

869
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:56.620
<v Speaker 1>when I was reading this and the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>word that like dinged a little something</v>

870
00:39:56.621 --> 00:39:57.454
<v Speaker 1>in my head was progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's partly because of the </v>

871
00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:04.210
<v Speaker 1>way progressives have used progress that</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress in and of itself.</v>

872
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:07.480
<v Speaker 1>You want to progress meeting have more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more opportunity for people more and</v>

873
00:40:07.481 --> 00:40:08.314
<v Speaker 1>more equality for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a far cry from what I </v>

874
00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:11.374
<v Speaker 1>think the progressive's are doing right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now because that's the most subjective </v>

875
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 1>one of any of those terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

876
00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:16.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

877
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I have the wisecrack that progressives </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate progress.</v>

878
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.930
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the people who denied </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've made progress,</v>

879
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.823
<v Speaker 1>it's often the people who politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>labeled themselves as progressive who </v>

880
00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:29.890
<v Speaker 1>can't stand the idea that we've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress because they wanted to save it.</v>

881
00:40:29.891 --> 00:40:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Every aspect of our current society and </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

882
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:35.530
<v Speaker 1>There's corrupt and racist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled by the,</v>

883
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.010
<v Speaker 1>by the one percent and everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting worse and worse and worse.</v>

884
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.003
<v Speaker 1>And ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the whole point of being a </v>

885
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:41.884
<v Speaker 1>progressive presumably is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive activism is not a waste of </v>

886
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:46.444
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it actually brings benefits and </v>

887
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.143
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually has it sort of the catch </v>

888
00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:51.814
<v Speaker 1>22 of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of progress in general that you have to </v>

889
00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.370
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a weird way,</v>

890
00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:59.770
<v Speaker 1>you need to not acknowledge it to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>furthering it.</v>

891
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is an optimum amount and what </v>

892
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.320
<v Speaker 1>it has to keep in mind the two ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've made progress.</v>

893
00:41:05.321 --> 00:41:07.540
<v Speaker 1>But we've got huge challenges ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

894
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Just a very simple example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a extreme poverty,</v>

895
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:15.100
<v Speaker 1>the bare minimum that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you need to feed your family,</v>

896
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been,</v>

897
00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.220
<v Speaker 1>has been falling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

898
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.550
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be an example of progress in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of hundred years ago,</v>

899
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.593
<v Speaker 1>you could say that probably 90 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of humanity was living in extreme </v>

900
00:41:25.361 --> 00:41:27.190
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's less than 10 percent.</v>

901
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.580
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

902
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.910
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that happened just in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years.</v>

903
00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another way of stating the same fact</v>

904
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.540
<v Speaker 1>is that 730 million people live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme poverty.</v>

905
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Now that's the same fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 percent of seven point 3 billion,</v>

906
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.830
<v Speaker 1>730 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an awful lot of miserable people.</v>

907
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:47.083
<v Speaker 1>Now those are the same described in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways and we got to be able to </v>

908
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:53.450
<v Speaker 1>think in both ways and let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try to get it to zero now.</v>

909
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.283
<v Speaker 1>That's not a crazy romantic utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>story eyed a goal that is one of the UN </v>

910
00:41:59.871 --> 00:42:02.600
<v Speaker 1>sustainable development goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The predecessor,</v>

911
00:42:02.601 --> 00:42:03.434
<v Speaker 1>the Millennium Development Goals for </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty was reached five years ahead of </v>

912
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 1>schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the new goal,</v>

913
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.780
<v Speaker 1>which is to eliminate extreme poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere by 20,</v>

914
00:42:11.781 --> 00:42:14.810
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a little too optimistic,</v>

915
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.050
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not,</v>

916
00:42:16.051 --> 00:42:16.884
<v Speaker 1>not completely crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it'll be instead of zero </v>

917
00:42:19.521 --> 00:42:20.354
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it will be two percent and maybe </v>

918
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 1>it'll be 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

919
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.380
<v Speaker 1>but still it's an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

920
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.560
<v Speaker 1>aspiration in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of this do you think,</v>

921
00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:29.750
<v Speaker 1>and it's a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets back to the blank slate,</v>

922
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:32.600
<v Speaker 1>but how much of this do you think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way you view progress,</v>

923
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:33.643
<v Speaker 1>whether the acknowledgement of progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>or that you sort of need to feel that </v>

924
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:39.470
<v Speaker 1>we've made no progress to kind of fuel </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>

925
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.513
<v Speaker 1>How much of that do you think is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardwired in the way we look at the </v>

926
00:42:43.521 --> 00:42:44.354
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

927
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I think some of it comes from a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive biases.</v>

928
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.063
<v Speaker 1>One of them being the availability </v>
<v Speaker 1>heuristic being discovered by Daniel </v>

929
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:53.893
<v Speaker 1>Kahneman and Amos Tversky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely the human mind generally </v>

930
00:42:55.671 --> 00:42:59.900
<v Speaker 1>estimates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability and risk by calling examples</v>

931
00:42:59.901 --> 00:43:02.180
<v Speaker 1>from memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've just seen a,</v>

932
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:03.014
<v Speaker 1>a tornado on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think that tornadoes are a </v>

933
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:07.670
<v Speaker 1>major cause of death and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

934
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:11.450
<v Speaker 1>falls off ladders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed many more people than tornadoes.</v>

935
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't register because those don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the news.</v>

936
00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.053
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

937
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.983
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't naturally calibrate for how </v>

938
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:21.650
<v Speaker 1>many opportunities there are for bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to happen,</v>

939
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.600
<v Speaker 1>how big the world is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people there are,</v>

940
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:26.990
<v Speaker 1>we just remember the examples and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what drives our intuitions.</v>

941
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And when you have the news media </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting,</v>

942
00:43:29.541 --> 00:43:30.374
<v Speaker 1>everything that goes wrong everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can come away with an </v>

943
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:36.590
<v Speaker 1>impression that the world is falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart because all the parts of the world</v>

944
00:43:36.591 --> 00:43:38.510
<v Speaker 1>that aren't falling apart just never </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the news.</v>

945
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is also a,</v>

946
00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:41.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

947
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:42.103
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think tuned to dwell on the negative </v>

948
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.303
<v Speaker 1>probably because bad things can hurt you</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more than good things can help </v>

949
00:43:50.631 --> 00:43:51.464
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is something adaptive in a </v>

950
00:43:52.251 --> 00:43:54.780
<v Speaker 1>natural environment to be on the lookout</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

951
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.290
<v Speaker 1>for what can kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's just a survival instinct.</v>

952
00:43:57.291 --> 00:43:57.950
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

953
00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:00.440
<v Speaker 1>part of the survival instinct there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other things too,</v>

954
00:44:00.441 --> 00:44:01.380
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

955
00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:06.320
<v Speaker 1>there's always implicit competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>between different elites in society,</v>

956
00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.870
<v Speaker 1>the academics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the journalists,</v>

957
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 1>the politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business people that religious,</v>

958
00:44:11.271 --> 00:44:12.360
<v Speaker 1>the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

959
00:44:12.361 --> 00:44:13.194
<v Speaker 1>they're all different kinds of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers and they all kind of compete </v>

960
00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:19.430
<v Speaker 1>with each other for prestige and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an influence.</v>

961
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 1>And if you say society is declining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's corrupt,</v>

962
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:25.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>

963
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.570
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

964
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:30.170
<v Speaker 1>each one of these groups can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel superior to the others.</v>

965
00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.273
<v Speaker 1>The academics could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what the businessmen in the </v>

966
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a business when you can say,</v>

967
00:44:34.441 --> 00:44:36.270
<v Speaker 1>look what the politicians are doing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

968
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 1>And the challenges can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

969
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:39.543
<v Speaker 1>the incumbents are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's kind of a backhanded way of </v>

970
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.493
<v Speaker 1>social oneupmanship do you sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now we're at a unique position to </v>

971
00:44:48.841 --> 00:44:49.674
<v Speaker 1>bring back more enlightenment values?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it seems to me that because of </v>

972
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.600
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of social media,</v>

973
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:57.330
<v Speaker 1>that just everything is sort of upside </v>
<v Speaker 1>down right now.</v>

974
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:58.223
<v Speaker 1>This again has been a theme with a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my guests that everything is sort of </v>

975
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 1>on the table and that there's great </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

976
00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:04.890
<v Speaker 1>We don't know which way it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

977
00:45:04.891 --> 00:45:06.630
<v Speaker 1>but there's great opportunity for good </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

978
00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:08.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a great opportunity for bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

979
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:09.654
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know which way we're both hoping this </v>

980
00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:11.574
<v Speaker 1>is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

981
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.130
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that we actually are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a unique moment right now?</v>

982
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I know everyone always thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always going to be there.</v>

983
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:18.000
<v Speaker 1>They're always in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

984
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.980
<v Speaker 1>But do you think there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique right now?</v>

985
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

986
00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:21.943
<v Speaker 1>there's someone thinking that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of any quality of every reason </v>

987
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:30.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe growing that at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many areas in which we become</v>

988
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:32.790
<v Speaker 1>so much more rational and reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

989
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:37.940
<v Speaker 1>like evidence based medicine used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>your doctor had a hunch and operated on,</v>

990
00:45:38.041 --> 00:45:38.874
<v Speaker 1>you gave her your drug and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to think that we're actually </v>

991
00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:41.544
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now therapies are evaluated in a big </v>

992
00:45:44.251 --> 00:45:45.084
<v Speaker 1>studies or a data driven policing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons that the crime rate </v>

993
00:45:48.331 --> 00:45:49.164
<v Speaker 1>went down so dramatically starting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nineties is that the police started </v>

994
00:45:52.141 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 1>to gather block by block data and where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the violence was occurring,</v>

995
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.160
<v Speaker 1>they kind of collapsed on those areas </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a ton of bricks.</v>

996
00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

997
00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.420
<v Speaker 1>one gang member that just suffered a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

998
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:03.263
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an injury wouldn't be roaring for </v>

999
00:46:04.651 --> 00:46:05.700
<v Speaker 1>revenge saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1000
00:46:05.701 --> 00:46:10.701
<v Speaker 1>we were watching you and that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>drove down the rate of crime by a lot in</v>

1001
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:15.480
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sabermetrics moneyball,</v>

1002
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.480
<v Speaker 1>much more rational analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1003
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the effective altruism movement.</v>

1004
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 1>How can we allocate charity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>volunteering so it actually does good as</v>

1005
00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:27.300
<v Speaker 1>opposed to just giving people a warm </v>
<v Speaker 1>glow.</v>

1006
00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And so all of these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

1007
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:31.103
<v Speaker 1>you get these not all conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories and the fake news and be a </v>

1008
00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:40.820
<v Speaker 1>politicized denial of science such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccine safety and climate change.</v>

1009
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:42.923
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we let the standards of </v>

1010
00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:47.720
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitches will trickle down,</v>

1011
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.120
<v Speaker 1>make it so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1012
00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:51.373
<v Speaker 1>that it's kind of second nature for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone to just not think in certain </v>

1013
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:58.770
<v Speaker 1>ways because they had just been proven </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be obviously ridiculous.</v>

1014
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do it?</v>

1015
00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good.</v>

1016
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.450
<v Speaker 1>So I may not be the one to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1017
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:03.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1018
00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:04.713
<v Speaker 1>to change a whole society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it by appealing to the kind of </v>

1019
00:47:07.561 --> 00:47:08.394
<v Speaker 1>people who watch the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of people would read my books in </v>

1020
00:47:09.991 --> 00:47:12.690
<v Speaker 1>the hopes that it will kind of spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>out from there.</v>

1021
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:13.950
<v Speaker 1>And we know it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1022
00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:14.853
<v Speaker 1>it's not that it can't happen there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are certain bad ideas that at one </v>

1023
00:47:18.841 --> 00:47:22.290
<v Speaker 1>point are taken seriously and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just drop off.</v>

1024
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one talks about when ever,</v>

1025
00:47:24.451 --> 00:47:27.750
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my lifetime when I was a kid,</v>

1026
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.770
<v Speaker 1>there was a debate over racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>segregation,</v>

1027
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>

1028
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.270
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should black students be admitted to the</v>

1029
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.900
<v Speaker 1>University of Mississippi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1030
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.910
<v Speaker 1>you just couldn't have that debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1031
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Even among the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the farthest right of the right.</v>

1032
00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.900
<v Speaker 1>That's just no longer an issue should </v>
<v Speaker 1>women be allowed to,</v>

1033
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:43.570
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1034
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:44.403
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>

1035
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1036
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.493
<v Speaker 1>in earlier decades and centuries it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery or women's suffrage and </v>

1037
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:53.800
<v Speaker 1>superstitions like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1038
00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:57.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alchemy a or a human sacrifice.</v>

1039
00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:58.383
<v Speaker 1>So it's not hopeless that sometimes what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is that at any given time </v>

1040
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a range of reasonableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

1041
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:06.343
<v Speaker 1>that center drifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that some things that were at the </v>

1042
00:48:09.281 --> 00:48:10.350
<v Speaker 1>tail end of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1043
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:11.343
<v Speaker 1>of ridiculousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the conspiracy theory mongers and </v>

1044
00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:18.670
<v Speaker 1>the most benighted can no longer take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

1045
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you,</v>

1046
00:48:19.991 --> 00:48:20.824
<v Speaker 1>this is just sort of are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the discussion around all this is </v>

1047
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.750
<v Speaker 1>just about our lack of patience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because actually when the,</v>

1048
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.510
<v Speaker 1>when the publisher sent me the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said Enlightenment now.</v>

1049
00:48:28.511 --> 00:48:29.344
<v Speaker 1>And as you think you guys had the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he's bigger than enlightenment </v>

1050
00:48:32.021 --> 00:48:35.620
<v Speaker 1>and I thought that was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because we live in a time of</v>

1051
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:36.454
<v Speaker 1>immediate reaction to everything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfies and likes and people just don't </v>

1052
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:42.040
<v Speaker 1>have patience anymore.</v>

1053
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:42.873
<v Speaker 1>Attention spans are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are incredibly short that we want more </v>

1054
00:48:47.681 --> 00:48:48.514
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of these things are just the </v>

1055
00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:51.350
<v Speaker 1>long game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1056
00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

1057
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.363
<v Speaker 1>We also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have Amnesia for how things were not </v>

1058
00:48:57.581 --> 00:48:58.960
<v Speaker 1>so long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1059
00:48:58.961 --> 00:49:01.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a point that I make a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly,</v>

1060
00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:03.250
<v Speaker 1>even though there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1061
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a horrific war going on now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>

1062
00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:08.500
<v Speaker 1>but we forget some of the horrific wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were going on in the,</v>

1063
00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:10.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the eighties and nineties.</v>

1064
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.213
<v Speaker 1>What can we do to stop that Amnesia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that's a big part of </v>

1065
00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:15.430
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1066
00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:17.770
<v Speaker 1>And I think the culture of journalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>

1067
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.130
<v Speaker 1>should put events of the day into some </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

1068
00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean going back hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1069
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.850
<v Speaker 1>the American revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even just,</v>

1070
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:25.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was like in the 19 nineties was </v>

1071
00:49:26.721 --> 00:49:29.230
<v Speaker 1>likely the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the likewise we'll be economy.</v>

1072
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:33.940
<v Speaker 1>People are so nostalgic for the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas with strong unions and predictable</v>

1073
00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:36.220
<v Speaker 1>wages and factory jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1074
00:49:36.221 --> 00:49:39.940
<v Speaker 1>that was also the era of a double digit </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation.</v>

1075
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen percent inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could pay the rent this year,</v>

1076
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:43.354
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know whether you could pay it</v>
<v Speaker 1>next year because rick could go up and </v>

1077
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:46.913
<v Speaker 1>kind of forget about those days long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lines around the block that had </v>

1078
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.823
<v Speaker 1>gasoline for fear that we'd run out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heating oil and fuel freeze in the </v>

1079
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:54.993
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A huge high rates of poverty among the </v>

1080
00:49:58.721 --> 00:49:59.554
<v Speaker 1>elderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that have been has been brought </v>

1081
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:03.460
<v Speaker 1>down by social security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so our just.</v>

1082
00:50:03.461 --> 00:50:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Our commentary should look back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not ancient history,</v>

1083
00:50:07.031 --> 00:50:08.650
<v Speaker 1>but recent history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.430
<v Speaker 1>What are some of the other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are that are hopeful right now?</v>

1085
00:50:12.431 --> 00:50:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Are there other markers in society or in</v>
<v Speaker 1>science or politics?</v>

1086
00:50:16.211 --> 00:50:17.044
<v Speaker 1>Are there any other trends that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing right now that you think are </v>

1087
00:50:19.061 --> 00:50:21.520
<v Speaker 1>leading us to some positive places?</v>

1088
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often you get pleasant surprises when </v>

1089
00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:26.680
<v Speaker 1>you actually look at trends instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>headlines,</v>

1090
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.950
<v Speaker 1>and you and I were talking off camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a,</v>

1091
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:30.853
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a recent survey that showed that </v>

1092
00:50:31.781 --> 00:50:32.614
<v Speaker 1>contrary to the fears of a millennial </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation being intolerant of free </v>

1093
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:39.830
<v Speaker 1>speech and the rep for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the society as a whole,</v>

1094
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 1>and especially university campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually,</v>

1095
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:45.920
<v Speaker 1>according to this new study anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually plot the data.</v>

1096
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:50.980
<v Speaker 1>We asked people should people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>espousing controversial beliefs at least</v>

1097
00:50:51.171 --> 00:50:53.900
<v Speaker 1>be able to say them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually been going up.</v>

1098
00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:55.143
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's higher among the college educated </v>

1099
00:50:57.021 --> 00:50:57.854
<v Speaker 1>than the less college educated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It spans a range of controversial </v>

1100
00:51:00.831 --> 00:51:01.664
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true for millennials as well as </v>

1101
00:51:03.651 --> 00:51:05.630
<v Speaker 1>baby boomers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

1102
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:06.913
<v Speaker 1>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself even experienced as a kind of </v>

1103
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:14.420
<v Speaker 1>dread and foreboding about a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation being intolerant of competing</v>

1104
00:51:14.421 --> 00:51:16.400
<v Speaker 1>views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be probably overblown.</v>

1105
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:19.610
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of examples like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other positive developments,</v>

1106
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:20.191
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1107
00:51:20.191 --> 00:51:23.090
<v Speaker 1>the high school students protesting are </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>

1108
00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:23.924
<v Speaker 1>gun safety laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of something that we couldn't </v>

1109
00:51:27.471 --> 00:51:28.350
<v Speaker 1>have predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1110
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.273
<v Speaker 1>so recently the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the me too movement has had a lot of </v>

1111
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:34.550
<v Speaker 1>excesses and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's much to criticize.</v>

1112
00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:35.613
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not okay for women to be preyed </v>

1113
00:51:37.431 --> 00:51:38.264
<v Speaker 1>upon by their bosses and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly becoming an issue and probably </v>

1114
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:44.540
<v Speaker 1>the society will on the whole change for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better because of it.</v>

1115
00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't planning on going here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but since you mentioned it,</v>

1116
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:52.420
<v Speaker 1>what would be a humanistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened way of looking at guns right</v>

1117
00:51:54.171 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1118
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it a lot.</v>

1119
00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:57.883
<v Speaker 1>It has to start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with good data because a lot of our </v>

1120
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.590
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1121
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.620
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1122
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe wrong on the right,</v>

1123
00:52:05.751 --> 00:52:06.584
<v Speaker 1>they believe you have concealed carry </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws then that will reduce crime on the </v>

1124
00:52:09.681 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

1125
00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:14.870
<v Speaker 1>There is if we control guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will reduce a homicide.</v>

1126
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:19.400
<v Speaker 1>So we've got to be humble and try to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>as many studies as possible to know what</v>

1127
00:52:19.401 --> 00:52:20.900
<v Speaker 1>will really make a difference in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't.</v>

1128
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 1>But in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that,</v>

1129
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're,</v>

1130
00:52:25.221 --> 00:52:28.790
<v Speaker 1>we're better off if we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we individually are not the,</v>

1131
00:52:28.791 --> 00:52:30.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of judged,</v>

1132
00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:32.570
<v Speaker 1>jury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jury and executioner,</v>

1133
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:34.303
<v Speaker 1>that one of the great advances of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization was that you outsource </v>

1134
00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:41.660
<v Speaker 1>justice to a disinterested third party </v>
<v Speaker 1>named with the court system.</v>

1135
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:43.483
<v Speaker 1>And that the idea that safety comes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals defending their interests </v>

1136
00:52:46.701 --> 00:52:50.390
<v Speaker 1>with guns is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will in fact almost certainly has led to</v>

1137
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:53.970
<v Speaker 1>high rates of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you fear though that we could,</v>

1138
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.170
<v Speaker 1>that we often give too much power to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state?</v>

1139
00:52:57.790 --> 00:52:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in,</v>

1140
00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:00.650
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some areas we do,</v>

1141
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:04.160
<v Speaker 1>but I think the idea that people should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have guns so that they should resist the</v>

1142
00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:04.994
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1143
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.990
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1144
00:53:05.991 --> 00:53:10.991
<v Speaker 1>the kind of David Koresh and Idaho a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cults,</v>

1145
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:15.020
<v Speaker 1>that is a terrible idea.</v>

1146
00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.720
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we should resist the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government with,</v>

1147
00:53:16.721 --> 00:53:17.900
<v Speaker 1>with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1148
00:53:17.901 --> 00:53:20.810
<v Speaker 1>that's what they do in Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somalia,</v>

1149
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:22.183
<v Speaker 1>we have this thing called democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the government becomes too </v>

1150
00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:26.340
<v Speaker 1>repressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we speak out against it.</v>

1151
00:53:26.341 --> 00:53:28.140
<v Speaker 1>We vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we petition,</v>

1152
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we form organizations.</v>

1153
00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:32.070
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that we're going to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>back at the police,</v>

1154
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nuts.</v>

1155
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.120
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of the state of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy in general?</v>

1156
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Because I think we're breaking off into </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different factions now where,</v>

1157
00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.113
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some people genuinely think </v>

1158
00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:43.201
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1159
00:53:43.201 --> 00:53:44.034
<v Speaker 1>this hashtag resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're under this horrific </v>

1160
00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:46.944
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian regime with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even have to get into trump </v>

1161
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.193
<v Speaker 1>specifically if you don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think of just sort of </v>

1162
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.963
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1163
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 1>the systems that are in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the branches of government,</v>

1164
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:56.634
<v Speaker 1>all of the documents that founded this </v>
<v Speaker 1>or are they doing all right at the </v>

1165
00:53:59.341 --> 00:54:00.174
<v Speaker 1>moment?</v>

1166
00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are a lot of,</v>

1167
00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:07.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by any standards of world history,</v>

1168
00:54:07.171 --> 00:54:11.250
<v Speaker 1>we live in fantastic freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know I could say that,</v>

1169
00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:11.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1170
00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.390
<v Speaker 1>trump is a moron and he's a fascist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to worry about being put in</v>

1171
00:54:15.391 --> 00:54:16.141
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1172
00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:17.670
<v Speaker 1>that's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something to take,</v>

1173
00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 1>not to take for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I sent the equivalent in Turkey,</v>

1174
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be put in jail or in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1175
00:54:22.701 --> 00:54:26.160
<v Speaker 1>in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a little bit of the short memory</v>

1176
00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:28.230
<v Speaker 1>on some of these things and why you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know history?</v>

1177
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that all the time I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys all over twitter medians.</v>

1178
00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:32.670
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:36.390
<v Speaker 1>You can say what ever you really can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should not take that for granted.</v>

1180
00:54:36.391 --> 00:54:37.224
<v Speaker 1>It's apartment history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also partly a comparisons across </v>

1181
00:54:40.201 --> 00:54:43.590
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then history remembering fascism and</v>

1182
00:54:43.591 --> 00:54:46.080
<v Speaker 1>communism and looking at regions today </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1183
00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.060
<v Speaker 1>like Turkey and Venezuela and Russia.</v>

1184
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:50.190
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1185
00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:51.363
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not so healthy is like </v>

1186
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:58.260
<v Speaker 1>gerrymandering that obviously super a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subversion of democracy,</v>

1187
00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.513
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects of lobbying and campaign </v>

1188
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.510
<v Speaker 1>contributions from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1189
00:55:03.511 --> 00:55:05.640
<v Speaker 1>the wealthiest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can't be a good idea.</v>

1190
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 1>The fact that our elections drag on for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and depends so much on,</v>

1191
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:13.550
<v Speaker 1>on a cash is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1192
00:55:13.551 --> 00:55:17.310
<v Speaker 1>and there are government bureaucracies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have gotten too big and too,</v>

1193
00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:21.060
<v Speaker 1>too many regulations that don't actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything beneficial.</v>

1194
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that means that's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>for just reducing regulation with,</v>

1195
00:55:26.681 --> 00:55:27.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1196
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:27.864
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meat cleaver because some regulations </v>

1197
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:30.960
<v Speaker 1>really have done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done good.</v>

1198
00:55:30.961 --> 00:55:33.450
<v Speaker 1>We've got cleaner air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got less poverty.</v>

1199
00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:34.383
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we should at least analyze what </v>

1200
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:38.630
<v Speaker 1>government programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1201
00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:39.493
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are cost effective and which ones are </v>

1202
00:55:40.471 --> 00:55:42.930
<v Speaker 1>just a nuisance and a drag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1203
00:55:42.931 --> 00:55:47.060
<v Speaker 1>And even having that conversation then </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets people crazy where I,</v>

1204
00:55:47.061 --> 00:55:47.894
<v Speaker 1>I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from it from a little more of a </v>

1205
00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:49.974
<v Speaker 1>libertarian perspective and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually say that these days we've got </v>

1206
00:55:52.381 --> 00:55:53.214
<v Speaker 1>people like Elon Musk that can get us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars and that can help clean the </v>

1207
00:55:56.641 --> 00:55:57.474
<v Speaker 1>environment and green energy and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things where I know there's just </v>

1208
00:55:59.671 --> 00:56:01.020
<v Speaker 1>another set of people that think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1209
00:56:01.021 --> 00:56:03.450
<v Speaker 1>we just can't leave it to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrialists.</v>

1210
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:04.283
<v Speaker 1>We have to leave it to the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's at least a place where we can </v>

1211
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.030
<v Speaker 1>have some respectful disagreement that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1212
00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:09.923
<v Speaker 1>that's a great place to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the conversation we should be </v>

1213
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:11.840
<v Speaker 1>having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1214
00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:12.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1215
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.033
<v Speaker 1>my view is that there has to be a mix of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a policy and regulation and a private </v>

1216
00:56:19.141 --> 00:56:22.740
<v Speaker 1>enterprise I and with all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity and,</v>

1217
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:24.243
<v Speaker 1>and bottom up a diversity that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an example would be one thing that </v>

1218
00:56:27.821 --> 00:56:31.720
<v Speaker 1>the government can do and that private </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry can do is put a price on carbon</v>

1219
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:34.780
<v Speaker 1>emissions and this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a position that both left wing and right</v>

1220
00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:37.330
<v Speaker 1>wing economists favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having done that,</v>

1221
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.193
<v Speaker 1>then the private sector can come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a technology to reduce CO2 and it </v>

1222
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:43.600
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be up to the government to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1223
00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.850
<v Speaker 1>this company is the one that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have support.</v>

1224
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the,</v>

1225
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:47.981
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1226
00:56:47.981 --> 00:56:48.814
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free market really does a better </v>

1227
00:56:49.481 --> 00:56:50.830
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having that,</v>

1228
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:51.723
<v Speaker 1>that discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think Libertarians deserve credit </v>

1229
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:59.350
<v Speaker 1>for raising an issue that people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left just don't even think of.</v>

1230
00:56:59.351 --> 00:57:00.184
<v Speaker 1>Like just because you have good </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions and you have a program with </v>

1231
00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 1>the goal of achieving some good doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean it's gonna work.</v>

1232
00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:06.663
<v Speaker 1>Total waste of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what I think so much of it </v>

1233
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:09.760
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds good.</v>

1234
00:57:09.761 --> 00:57:10.594
<v Speaker 1>It all sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want the government to do all these </v>

1235
00:57:13.091 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 1>things and then we know that in practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>

1236
00:57:15.971 --> 00:57:16.804
<v Speaker 1>although you've laid out a case for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these things that actually do work </v>

1237
00:57:18.611 --> 00:57:19.770
<v Speaker 1>cleaner air here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

1238
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:21.730
<v Speaker 1>we're in Los Angeles and air is cleaner </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really,</v>

1239
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:23.440
<v Speaker 1>it had a lot to do with the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1240
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.393
<v Speaker 1>So I absolutely acknowledge that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me it seems like so much of it </v>

1241
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 1>feels like it's.</v>

1242
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:28.943
<v Speaker 1>It sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just sort of hand it to the </v>

1243
00:57:30.941 --> 00:57:31.631
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:57:31.631 --> 00:57:32.464
<v Speaker 1>And then you end up creating a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>series of other problems that are from </v>

1245
00:57:35.741 --> 00:57:38.200
<v Speaker 1>fiscal things to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to all sorts of other things.</v>

1246
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I agree and I think actually in some</v>

1247
00:57:40.091 --> 00:57:44.110
<v Speaker 1>ways liberals had been their own worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy and not being willing to have that</v>

1248
00:57:44.111 --> 00:57:46.540
<v Speaker 1>conversation and almost like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform is,</v>

1249
00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:47.643
<v Speaker 1>if you support government programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a good person and if you post </v>

1250
00:57:49.511 --> 00:57:50.470
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad person.</v>

1251
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1252
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:55.690
<v Speaker 1>the discussion really should be which </v>
<v Speaker 1>government programs make us better off,</v>

1253
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.330
<v Speaker 1>repay their costs to clean up the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce poverty,</v>

1254
00:57:58.450 --> 00:57:59.500
<v Speaker 1>which ones are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1255
00:57:59.501 --> 00:58:00.334
<v Speaker 1>boondoggles are bureaucracies and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way even the people who are liberals </v>

1256
00:58:04.301 --> 00:58:06.970
<v Speaker 1>could at least have some ammunition and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1257
00:58:06.971 --> 00:58:07.511
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1258
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:09.550
<v Speaker 1>don't kill that program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually works.</v>

1259
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:10.973
<v Speaker 1>And I have in the book a graph of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental quality since the EPA was </v>

1260
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.220
<v Speaker 1>initiated in 1970 by Richard Nixon.</v>

1261
00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:21.053
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the population has increased by 40 </v>

1262
00:58:23.051 --> 00:58:26.910
<v Speaker 1>percent GDP increased by two and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1263
00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:31.180
<v Speaker 1>we've driven twice as many miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but air pollution has been reduced by 60</v>

1264
00:58:31.181 --> 00:58:32.530
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1265
00:58:32.531 --> 00:58:34.900
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that almost certainly wouldn't have just</v>

1266
00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:37.360
<v Speaker 1>happened with market innovation because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no,</v>

1267
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:40.150
<v Speaker 1>no one individually has an incentive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not pollute.</v>

1268
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of thing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments can make a difference.</v>

1269
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:44.433
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a poverty or there are certain </v>

1270
00:58:47.441 --> 00:58:49.540
<v Speaker 1>measures like the earned income tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit,</v>

1271
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:50.433
<v Speaker 1>which is a kind of negative income tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>where almost everyone who a right and </v>

1272
00:58:54.701 --> 00:58:55.534
<v Speaker 1>left two exams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a government program that </v>

1273
00:58:56.711 --> 00:58:58.030
<v Speaker 1>really worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cheap.</v>

1274
00:58:58.330 --> 00:58:59.163
<v Speaker 1>So automatic and it really did reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty and the lower middle class and </v>

1275
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:07.510
<v Speaker 1>working poor and we need to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion so that the liberals for that</v>

1276
00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:08.470
<v Speaker 1>matter can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1277
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.520
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this program works.</v>

1278
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Don't cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't pay.</v>

1279
00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:11.973
<v Speaker 1>But even they have kind of disarmed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the often on the evidentiary a debate </v>

1280
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.690
<v Speaker 1>and just made it more realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1281
00:59:19.691 --> 00:59:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what so many of us that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would include in this new group.</v>

1282
00:59:23.361 --> 00:59:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard this phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual dark web?</v>

1283
00:59:25.261 --> 00:59:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Has this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has this come across your desk?</v>

1284
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I googled it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1285
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 1>do you sort of catch what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1286
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's to say what it is or </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is in it or whatever,</v>

1287
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:38.180
<v Speaker 1>but it strikes me that you were sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the people that's right there.</v>

1288
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:39.063
<v Speaker 1>Just people that are all coming together</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're just trying to get a </v>

1289
00:59:42.471 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 1>little bit of the answers here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really is what this is about.</v>

1290
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1291
00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.860
<v Speaker 1>the way Jonathan Haidt calls it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his viewpoint diversity,</v>

1292
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:50.543
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1293
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:51.633
<v Speaker 1>it's not pushing a particular ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's getting a set of ideas out </v>

1294
00:59:55.671 --> 00:59:56.900
<v Speaker 1>there that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have to,</v>

1295
00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.040
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to struggle.</v>

1296
00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.520
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get a pass.</v>

1297
00:59:59.521 --> 01:00:02.030
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mentioning them is that,</v>

1298
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.380
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now now attack them,</v>

1299
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>see if they survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a piece of America right now or</v>

1300
01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I guess we can say this in the West in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

1301
01:00:10.221 --> 01:00:13.130
<v Speaker 1>that our freedoms have gotten so good </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1302
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>that we can't really figure out what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

1303
01:00:15.981 --> 01:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like during the,</v>

1304
01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:19.143
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole debate over the football </v>

1305
01:00:20.361 --> 01:00:21.194
<v Speaker 1>players kneeling for the anthem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching people and everyone's </v>

1306
01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:26.240
<v Speaker 1>just screaming about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And half the people hate trump.</v>

1307
01:00:26.241 --> 01:00:27.074
<v Speaker 1>Half the people say the football players</v>
<v Speaker 1>are anti American and half the people </v>

1308
01:00:29.241 --> 01:00:30.074
<v Speaker 1>turn it on the owners of the teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I tried to lay out a case that </v>

1309
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>actually the entire thing worked the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was supposed to do in a free society.</v>

1310
01:00:38.781 --> 01:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Trump said something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't.</v>

1311
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Whether you agree with what he said or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not about mocking the players,</v>

1312
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:45.283
<v Speaker 1>he didn't try to pass a law about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he has so he exercises his free </v>

1313
01:00:48.051 --> 01:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

1314
01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:51.380
<v Speaker 1>It's important to recognize that that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has that right to.</v>

1315
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:53.150
<v Speaker 1>If he had tried to pass a law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a different thing.</v>

1316
01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>The players could either neil or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>neil,</v>

1317
01:00:55.971 --> 01:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>they might have to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>repercussions of that.</v>

1318
01:00:58.701 --> 01:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>The owners could decide whether they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want it to keep those players on.</v>

1319
01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Their teams are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fans could decide if they want it to</v>

1320
01:01:04.611 --> 01:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>not buy jerseys or not or not attend </v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

1321
01:01:06.711 --> 01:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me it was actually like a puzzle</v>

1322
01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:11.593
<v Speaker 1>of freedom actually working and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day for months people were </v>

1323
01:01:15.351 --> 01:01:16.490
<v Speaker 1>screaming that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1324
01:01:16.491 --> 01:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>that this is tyrannical regime and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything so horrible.</v>

1325
01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:21.243
<v Speaker 1>Does that sort of jive with you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've gotten to a place where we </v>

1326
01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:24.314
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our freedoms are so great that we're </v>

1327
01:01:25.851 --> 01:01:26.684
<v Speaker 1>making these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these mountains out of things that are </v>

1328
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>important to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1329
01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.753
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good.</v>

1330
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>That's good analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1331
01:01:33.151 --> 01:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a way of appreciating what </v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries would would die for.</v>

1332
01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:38.893
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just couldn't have that football </v>

1333
01:01:40.101 --> 01:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>players or soccer players and the here </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Turkey protests,</v>

1334
01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>government policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

1335
01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>they'd be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>

1336
01:01:45.891 --> 01:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>one of our ally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1337
01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:47.683
<v Speaker 1>ally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends how you want to use air </v>

1338
01:01:49.911 --> 01:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1339
01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I think sort of a good point.</v>

1340
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:53.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1341
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.580
<v Speaker 1>So before we finish up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me it.</v>

1342
01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:55.423
<v Speaker 1>Give me a few more things to just feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopeful about because I think that </v>

1343
01:01:57.830 --> 01:01:58.663
<v Speaker 1>really is what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to show people that </v>

1344
01:02:00.711 --> 01:02:03.800
<v Speaker 1>there's so much goodness right now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not lose that.</v>

1345
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1346
01:02:04.311 --> 01:02:05.121
<v Speaker 1>here's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1347
01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heartening facts.</v>

1348
01:02:06.211 --> 01:02:07.044
<v Speaker 1>They have the flynn effect that Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>scores have been rising by three points </v>

1349
01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>a decade for almost a century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A something here.</v>

1350
01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible as it may sound really well.</v>

1351
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to dive into that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

1352
01:02:18.831 --> 01:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I spent much time on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1353
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>certainly the fact that extreme poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been plummeting,</v>

1354
01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I think is one of the greatest things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ever happened to me,</v>

1355
01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:27.923
<v Speaker 1>literally from 75 percent reduction just</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 30 years in global rate of extreme </v>

1356
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>poverty and the rise of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of literacy,</v>

1357
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.573
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of the world's population </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the age of 25 can read and write </v>

1358
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>and there's almost perfect parody now </v>
<v Speaker 1>between girls and boys,</v>

1359
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>but that's encouraging diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Infectious diseases are in decline.</v>

1360
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria,</v>

1361
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diarrhea,</v>

1362
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.513
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we vanquish smallpox just sent it off </v>

1363
01:02:53.761 --> 01:02:54.580
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1364
01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:55.413
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1365
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into ancient history.</v>

1366
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:01.110
<v Speaker 1>It's no longer a disease there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may do the same thing with polio with</v>

1367
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Guinea worm is terrific progress being </v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

1368
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1369
01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:10.230
<v Speaker 1>and values of toleration.</v>

1370
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1371
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:12.533
<v Speaker 1>what would I think we'd all agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or progressive values such as a </v>

1372
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.930
<v Speaker 1>toleration of homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of women's equality,</v>

1373
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:22.650
<v Speaker 1>have the right to get a divorce of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political participation.</v>

1374
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those have,</v>

1375
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.713
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all been in Ge in a gradual increase in </v>

1376
01:03:27.661 --> 01:03:28.494
<v Speaker 1>every part of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the most politically backward </v>

1377
01:03:31.831 --> 01:03:32.820
<v Speaker 1>part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Namely,</v>

1378
01:03:32.821 --> 01:03:36.330
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East and North Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been an increase with,</v>

1379
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:37.223
<v Speaker 1>especially when you compare generations </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the younger generations are much </v>

1380
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:41.360
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1381
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:42.533
<v Speaker 1>open and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sympathetic to liberal values than </v>

1382
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.740
<v Speaker 1>the older generation and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1383
01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.280
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a widespread illusion.</v>

1384
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Everyone thinks that everyone else is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more reactionary than they really are.</v>

1385
