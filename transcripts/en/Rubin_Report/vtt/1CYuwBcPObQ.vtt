1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.483
<v Speaker 2>hey everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be doing something a </v>

3
00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:04.624
<v Speaker 2>little different this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got my new eyes jumping on a skype </v>

4
00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:09.080
<v Speaker 2>call shortly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and Sam Harris or cough.</v>

5
00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:09.914
<v Speaker 2>There is a new book about Islam and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Maajid is a former Islamic extremist </v>

6
00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A ton of you guys have been asking us to</v>

7
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:16.840
<v Speaker 2>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he lives in London,</v>

8
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 2>so we thought we'd give the skype thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>a shot.</v>

9
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in New York at the moment.</v>

10
00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I saw a picture of him and Morgan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Freeman in a mosque yesterday,</v>

11
00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to ask him about that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more in a little bit,</v>

12
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 2>but first let's do a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>housekeeping.</v>

13
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.983
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles we laid out in the first </v>

14
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 2>episode and some of the reaction to last</v>
<v Speaker 2>week show.</v>

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 2>It seems that a bunch of you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrilled with my guest.</v>

16
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:36.214
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy is a hardcore lefty progressive </v>

17
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:42.100
<v Speaker 2>and uses some of the tactics I mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I wouldn't be using on the show.</v>

18
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.113
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just say that I can only hold </v>

19
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:44.824
<v Speaker 2>myself to the rules that I laid out if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped and mentioned saying every time </v>

20
00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:49.084
<v Speaker 2>a guest said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that goes against my personal </v>

21
00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:51.364
<v Speaker 2>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show would be incredibly slow and </v>

22
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 2>horrifically painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More importantly,</v>

23
00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:58.420
<v Speaker 2>as we build a community based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerance and other ideas,</v>

24
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:02.050
<v Speaker 2>it's important that we remain tolerant </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ideas we don't like.</v>

25
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy is a great friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've worked together on air for years.</v>

26
00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:06.184
<v Speaker 2>We've done standup gigs together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had him and his wife over for </v>

27
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 2>dinner numerous times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 2>we don't agree on everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including some pretty big issues,</v>

29
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.163
<v Speaker 2>but I think life is about more than just</v>
<v Speaker 2>scoring who is right on everything all </v>

30
00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most interesting part of last week's</v>

31
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.660
<v Speaker 2>response was that some people said the </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode was an echo chamber and I didn't</v>

32
00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:23.680
<v Speaker 2>push back enough.</v>

33
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Other people question why I even had </v>
<v Speaker 2>people I disagree with on at all,</v>

34
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.380
<v Speaker 2>and that's the beauty of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

35
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.273
<v Speaker 2>We can all be part of the same exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and still see it through </v>

36
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:36.820
<v Speaker 2>our individual prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good journalism is the search for truth.</v>

37
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.683
<v Speaker 2>This show will be a battle of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just having our own ideas </v>

38
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:41.530
<v Speaker 2>reinforced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:42.364
<v Speaker 2>there's so much intolerance of the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>on both sides and I think we can create </v>

40
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Speaker 2>something that's so much better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

41
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't just think it.</v>

42
00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 2>I know it because I see it already </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

43
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Last week I had a hardcore progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>lefty.</v>

44
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 2>This week I have a former Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremists turned moderate,</v>

45
00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:00.670
<v Speaker 2>trying to reform his religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next week I have a gay conservative from</v>

46
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Breitbart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milo Yiannopoulos.</v>

47
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 2>I won't agree with all of them all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

48
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 2>but I most likely won't shout them down </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

49
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I have enough faith in you guys that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an honest conversation here,</v>

50
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:11.920
<v Speaker 2>the truth will present itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This of course,</v>

51
00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:15.130
<v Speaker 2>reminds me of the Galactic Republic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the early days of the death star,</v>

52
00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:18.820
<v Speaker 2>grandma tarkin wanted to stifle debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had the most powerful super</v>

53
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:20.590
<v Speaker 2>laser in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

54
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:24.550
<v Speaker 2>let's not forget that darth vader said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the death star was nothing compared</v>

55
00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 2>to the power of the force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The force is on our side.</v>

56
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Let's use it wisely.</v>

57
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

58
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.210
<v Speaker 2>So much and thanks for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been going back and forth for,</v>

59
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 2>for months now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only had to show up for,</v>

60
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:37.914
<v Speaker 2>for three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've been going back and forth for </v>

61
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.150
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

62
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 2>you're in New York right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

63
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 2>you live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in London,</v>

64
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

65
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.663
<v Speaker 2>So you live in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're halfway between a Los Angeles </v>

67
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:52.520
<v Speaker 2>and London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I figured we'd do the skype because I</v>

68
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 2>don't know when you're gonna be out </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

69
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any La plans coming?</v>

70
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.393
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to come to La and I was good </v>

71
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:00.020
<v Speaker 2>friends in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

72
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 3>on the west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing fixed yet.</v>

73
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 3>So it's good to have this opportunity.</v>

74
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

75
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 2>so we'll do the skype thing with you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York and La.</v>

76
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:08.164
<v Speaker 2>So first off I saw a picture of you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tweeted yesterday you were hanging </v>

77
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.930
<v Speaker 2>out with Morgan Freeman in a mosque.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

78
00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 2>what was that about?</v>

79
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.423
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's brought me here to a New </v>

80
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.260
<v Speaker 3>York icon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Explain too much of it at the moment.</v>

81
00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:25.680
<v Speaker 3>All I can say is that I had a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with him in the,</v>

82
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Islamic center of,</v>

83
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of New York.</v>

84
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we spent a good hour or so having a chat</v>

85
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 3>about the distinctions between Islam and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamism and,</v>

86
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about my story and the work I do.</v>

87
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but beyond that we're just going to have</v>

88
00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:42.810
<v Speaker 3>to wait and see what else I'm to.</v>

89
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.730
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now he's played God.</v>

90
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.340
<v Speaker 2>So I guess he's the right guy to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that</v>

91
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.410
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the house of God.</v>

92
00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:52.050
<v Speaker 3>I was speaking to a man that played God </v>
<v Speaker 3>about God.</v>

93
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

94
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.011
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

95
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.844
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to you about some of the </v>

96
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 2>things that you probably did speak with </v>
<v Speaker 2>him that.</v>

97
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 2>So first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just start with your story because</v>

98
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your biography,</v>

99
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 2>what you've lived through to get to here</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really,</v>

100
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:08.010
<v Speaker 2>really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So can you just sort of sum that up in a</v>

101
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 2>couple minutes,</v>

102
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.890
<v Speaker 3>those who want the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

103
00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:12.680
<v Speaker 3>the full story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in my memoir called radical.</v>

104
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

105
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.140
<v Speaker 3>but in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a summarized form,</v>

106
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.480
<v Speaker 3>basically I joined a revolutionary Islam</v>
<v Speaker 3>is group at the age of 16 years old.</v>

107
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.883
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ended up on the leadership of this </v>

108
00:04:22.911 --> 00:04:23.744
<v Speaker 3>organization and spent 13 years with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and I played my role in exporting </v>

109
00:04:27.171 --> 00:04:28.004
<v Speaker 3>this organization from Britain to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan and then to Denmark and </v>

110
00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 3>eventually to Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The group's name was his,</v>

111
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.563
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the first among these limits </v>

112
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.560
<v Speaker 3>groups to popular reaction of </v>
<v Speaker 3>resurrecting a caliphate that would seek</v>

113
00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:47.150
<v Speaker 3>to conquer other countries and enforce </v>
<v Speaker 3>their version of Islam as low.</v>

114
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.440
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

115
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.580
<v Speaker 3>the method by which they aimed to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>to power was by a military coups.</v>

116
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.473
<v Speaker 3>So we are very much focused in </v>
<v Speaker 3>recruiting army officers to join our </v>

117
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:58.770
<v Speaker 3>organization and then inciting them </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards military coups.</v>

118
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.350
<v Speaker 3>And that's what took me to Pakistan is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what eventually took me to Egypt.</v>

119
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I arrived one day before the nine slash </v>
<v Speaker 3>11 attacks.</v>

120
00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:06.704
<v Speaker 3>And then 10 months later I found myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrested and detained and taken to the </v>

121
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:11.834
<v Speaker 3>torture dungeons of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stir state security headquarters in </v>

122
00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:15.254
<v Speaker 3>Cairo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then sentenced after four months in </v>

123
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.030
<v Speaker 3>solitary confinement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sentenced to five years in prison.</v>

124
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.463
<v Speaker 3>As a political prisoner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's at that point is when Amnesty </v>

125
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.680
<v Speaker 3>International adopted me as a prisoner </v>
<v Speaker 3>of conscience,</v>

126
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>began campaigning for my release because</v>

127
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:30.770
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

128
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 3>we had views that I now find repugnant </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what described as extreme,</v>

129
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.063
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were and we had a group still is non </v>

130
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.973
<v Speaker 3>non terrorist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why it's still illegal in </v>

131
00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:44.150
<v Speaker 3>America and across across Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

132
00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:44.984
<v Speaker 3>it's the distinction I draw between an </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamist group and a jihadist group is </v>

133
00:05:47.991 --> 00:05:48.824
<v Speaker 3>that if Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam is the desire to impose any </v>

134
00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:54.890
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of Islam over society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a jihadism is the use of force to spread</v>

135
00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam and uh,</v>

136
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.473
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and jihadist terrorism is the use of </v>

137
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 3>force to spread Islam Islam by targeting</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilians.</v>

138
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the group that I joined wasn't.</v>

139
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Islam is group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a jihadist group.</v>

140
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.663
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm glad you made that distinction </v>

141
00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:08.614
<v Speaker 2>because I do find that when we're having</v>
<v Speaker 2>this conversation and it's being had by </v>

142
00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:13.084
<v Speaker 2>so many different people in so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different forms that just the </v>

143
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:15.394
<v Speaker 2>definitions alone are lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know you've done a lot of work </v>

144
00:06:17.891 --> 00:06:18.724
<v Speaker 2>trying to just explain that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff to people so they're able to </v>

145
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.480
<v Speaker 2>understand what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

146
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive.</v>

147
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.860
<v Speaker 3>The problem is because this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon that we've never really dealt</v>

148
00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:26.694
<v Speaker 3>with before in terms of human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>have never really dealt with this </v>

149
00:06:29.101 --> 00:06:34.101
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ideological Islam seeking a,</v>

150
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very bolshevik form of control,</v>

151
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.080
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian control over society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We simply as,</v>

152
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.973
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as people didn't have the lexicon to </v>

153
00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:44.880
<v Speaker 3>have these conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So though I use the definitions,</v>

154
00:06:44.881 --> 00:06:49.560
<v Speaker 3>you won't find these definitions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolton universities or in academic tomes</v>

155
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.680
<v Speaker 3>because people will dealt with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem before.</v>

156
00:06:52.681 --> 00:06:56.910
<v Speaker 3>So part of the challenge that we faced </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in coming up with very crystal clear</v>

157
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.630
<v Speaker 3>logical definitions and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>popularizing them.</v>

158
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you often,</v>

159
00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:03.084
<v Speaker 3>you'll find that I repeat myself a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason I repeat myself is </v>

160
00:07:05.671 --> 00:07:06.750
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

161
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to popularize these terms into </v>

162
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.883
<v Speaker 3>popularize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These concepts can only come through </v>

163
00:07:12.391 --> 00:07:14.940
<v Speaker 3>repetition until everyone finally begins</v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand.</v>

164
00:07:14.941 --> 00:07:17.430
<v Speaker 3>And it got to a point where the prime </v>
<v Speaker 3>minister of the UK understood.</v>

165
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.990
<v Speaker 3>So we got somewhere.</v>

166
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.933
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you spent about five years in an </v>

167
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian prison now that was under </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mubarak at the time,</v>

168
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 2>who technically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose he was known as the president,</v>

169
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:31.160
<v Speaker 2>but he basically was a dictator that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>backed by the US for about 30 years.</v>

170
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.183
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that like being in an Egyptian </v>

171
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 2>prison?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine.</v>

172
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:36.783
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a pleasant experience at all </v>

173
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.710
<v Speaker 3>to the torture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

174
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.544
<v Speaker 3>for the first four days and then we will</v>
<v Speaker 3>put into solitary confinement for four </v>

175
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:49.630
<v Speaker 3>months and I was held in a cell as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of us are in that period of solitary</v>

176
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:52.420
<v Speaker 3>confinement cells where in which we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>no sanitation,</v>

177
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.590
<v Speaker 3>no lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

178
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.573
<v Speaker 3>no beds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had nothing but a bad concrete cell </v>

179
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.490
<v Speaker 3>in which to a English to try and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>through without,</v>

180
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.413
<v Speaker 3>without going insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I have with me actually I wanted </v>

181
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:08.791
<v Speaker 3>to show you this because I had a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was arrested I had a pocket sized</v>

182
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:12.040
<v Speaker 3>version of the Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is this in my hand here.</v>

183
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.303
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this particular Koran has been with me </v>

184
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.570
<v Speaker 3>from the day of my wrist all the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the torture dungeons through the</v>

185
00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:20.890
<v Speaker 3>solitary confinement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

186
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:21.863
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then through through the four years </v>

187
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:23.704
<v Speaker 3>in prison and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things I did is in the </v>

188
00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:27.160
<v Speaker 3>solitary confinement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have any.</v>

189
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.493
<v Speaker 3>I need light to read a or anything so </v>
<v Speaker 3>and obviously the mind can wander in </v>

190
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:35.470
<v Speaker 3>that sort of situation and you fear for </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own sanity.</v>

191
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:38.650
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things I would do is stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the,</v>

192
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.680
<v Speaker 3>by the door of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

193
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.523
<v Speaker 3>of the jail cell has looked for the wait</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the light to seep in through the </v>

194
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:45.610
<v Speaker 3>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I would stand there and read,</v>

195
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.850
<v Speaker 3>if you can see is a very small text is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually tiny now.</v>

196
00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

197
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I would read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ended up memorizing half of it.</v>

198
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of in my jail cell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

199
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:56.724
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was these sorts of things and it's </v>

200
00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:58.644
<v Speaker 3>why I've kept it seals these sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that kept me from going a not </v>

201
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:03.204
<v Speaker 3>during the solitary confinement period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And another thing I want to show you is </v>

202
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:06.871
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

203
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:11.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a radio which I had with me is,</v>

204
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:11.883
<v Speaker 3>is a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was given to me by the British </v>

205
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.460
<v Speaker 3>embassy and it was actually on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that I heard,</v>

206
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 3>first time that we'd been charged.</v>

207
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 3>We hadn't been informed officially by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the BBC World Service.</v>

208
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 3>I had reported it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was listening to it on this and</v>

209
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:28.884
<v Speaker 3>we found out that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact we'd been charged and then we </v>

210
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 3>would go to trial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

211
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and finally,</v>

212
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:34.254
<v Speaker 3>I think this picture is up on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet when I have the original with </v>

213
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 3>me and this is something I stole from </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>

214
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.243
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've kept it with me ever since </v>

215
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.503
<v Speaker 3>because it meant it means a lot to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a mug shot that was taken of me </v>

216
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.230
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the day,</v>

217
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 3>that's the very day we would drag from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the torture dungeon is to be thrown into</v>

218
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 3>solitary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's before I was actually,</v>

219
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 3>before I was actually put into solitary </v>
<v Speaker 3>confinement.</v>

220
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 3>That's me at 24 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now you see what you see is my,</v>

221
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my name in Arabic as you know,</v>

222
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.680
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there is a prison number and uh,</v>

223
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.583
<v Speaker 3>what I've done of course since then is </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've taken that number which is in </v>

224
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Arabic a two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

225
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:13.763
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

226
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.980
<v Speaker 3>and I have tattooed on my back as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a reminder for me actually have those</v>

227
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 3>days where I've come from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was your original question and the</v>

228
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:24.570
<v Speaker 3>journey that I've made to get to where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>am now.</v>

229
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such an incredible journey.</v>

230
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one other thing on the Gel thing,</v>

231
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:29.244
<v Speaker 2>I find that fascinating that they let </v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep a copy of the Qur'an with you </v>

232
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 2>because wasn't Mubarak basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that he was secular per se,</v>

233
00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:37.771
<v Speaker 2>but they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

234
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim Brotherhood was illegal under</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

235
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 2>You would think that he would want no </v>
<v Speaker 2>sign of religion to get the prisoners,</v>

236
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

237
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.520
<v Speaker 2>to apprise or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet he let you have it or they will</v>

238
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 3>on the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

239
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:52.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not about to defend Mubarak.</v>

240
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:52.883
<v Speaker 3>I cheered when he was overthrown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was held in the same cell that he </v>

241
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:57.460
<v Speaker 3>held me and afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not.</v>

242
00:10:57.461 --> 00:11:00.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm not here in any way to defend Hosni </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mubarak.</v>

243
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 3>What I would say is that the Egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 3>dictator and his regime,</v>

244
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.093
<v Speaker 3>I already understood the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I now make between Islam and </v>

245
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:09.894
<v Speaker 3>Islamism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their problem wasn't us holding copies </v>

246
00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:12.534
<v Speaker 3>of the Koran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem was the interpretation that </v>

247
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:15.960
<v Speaker 3>we and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

248
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.560
<v Speaker 3>and the ideology of Islam is that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>refer to,</v>

249
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:19.853
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would encourage us to study </v>

250
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.923
<v Speaker 3>traditional medieval Islam because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew that medieval Islam wasn't a Islam </v>

251
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.913
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would encourage us to be </v>

252
00:11:29.431 --> 00:11:30.264
<v Speaker 3>exposed to theologians from us how </v>
<v Speaker 3>university we were in prison and that </v>

253
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:35.004
<v Speaker 3>books so that we could read about Islam </v>
<v Speaker 3>from its medieval era and understand it </v>

254
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 3>wasn't this modern ideological form that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd come to adopt.</v>

255
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.920
<v Speaker 3>Now I say this and I say it with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>caveat that of course,</v>

256
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:47.843
<v Speaker 3>traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultra conservative medieval Islam also </v>

257
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Speaker 3>needs to be reformed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

258
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.650
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the pinnacle.</v>

259
00:11:52.651 --> 00:11:53.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not that of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

260
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the epitome of,</v>

261
00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of civil liberties.</v>

262
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we,</v>

263
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 3>what we have to accept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone who knows the basic,</v>

264
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.743
<v Speaker 3>the basic thing that most basic thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Islamic history and the </v>

265
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 3>development on Islamic theology will </v>
<v Speaker 3>know for all of its faults and there are</v>

266
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:11.134
<v Speaker 3>plenty of volts by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fundamentalism largely owes a debt </v>

267
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:16.470
<v Speaker 3>to sort of the fact that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

268
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.393
<v Speaker 3>we Muslims generally still revere that </v>
<v Speaker 3>medieval period of our theology and </v>

269
00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:21.754
<v Speaker 3>haven't developed it since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still very different to what </v>

270
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 3>the Islamists project is and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and an Egyptian authorities knew that.</v>

271
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:29.990
<v Speaker 3>So they would encourage us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

272
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:35.010
<v Speaker 3>they would rather we were a conservative</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious or fundamentalist Muslims than</v>

273
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Speaker 3>members of the Muslim Brotherhood.</v>

274
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so fascinating.</v>

275
00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:41.610
<v Speaker 2>And even if you think about what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on with Egypt now,</v>

276
00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:42.444
<v Speaker 2>where we sort of have another version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mubarak and CC and sort of controlling </v>

277
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:47.910
<v Speaker 2>things and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:50.460
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim Brotherhood was in charge for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year and we back them too.</v>

279
00:12:50.461 --> 00:12:50.961
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

280
00:12:50.961 --> 00:12:51.794
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before we move on to some of the </v>

281
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:56.490
<v Speaker 2>other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a clip where you were on real time</v>

282
00:12:56.491 --> 00:12:57.324
<v Speaker 2>with Bill Maher from about a year ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>and on the overtime segment you </v>

283
00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:02.970
<v Speaker 2>recounted a story about a bomb maker </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you met in jail.</v>

284
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.983
<v Speaker 2>And I was hoping you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just sum that up real quick </v>

285
00:13:05.341 --> 00:13:07.110
<v Speaker 2>because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was fascinating and it goes</v>

286
00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:09.150
<v Speaker 2>to very much what you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

287
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

288
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in prison that was a,</v>

289
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.083
<v Speaker 3>I mean we were imprisoned with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's who of the John Seeing at the </v>

290
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.780
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had the assassins of.</v>

291
00:13:18.781 --> 00:13:23.781
<v Speaker 3>I'm the oldest of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anwar Sadat who was killed in 1981 group</v>

292
00:13:24.391 --> 00:13:25.580
<v Speaker 3>was known as Tom Freeman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jihad.</v>

293
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Those who want to execute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that case were with us in prison.</v>

294
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.990
<v Speaker 3>We have a leader of the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brotherhood,</v>

295
00:13:30.991 --> 00:13:34.200
<v Speaker 3>Dr Muhammad and but here has since been </v>
<v Speaker 3>reincarcerated as you mentioned.</v>

296
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:35.483
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't the leader of the Brotherhood </v>

297
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.670
<v Speaker 3>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He became the leader of the Brotherhood,</v>

298
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:41.370
<v Speaker 3>but he and his entire leadership were </v>
<v Speaker 3>with me in prison.</v>

299
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:46.200
<v Speaker 3>We have a leadership of his mctivia and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we also had people that came from abroad</v>

300
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.500
<v Speaker 3>and the bomb maker that you refer to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular was from doggystyle next door</v>

301
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:53.490
<v Speaker 3>to Chechnya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

302
00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:54.090
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

303
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:54.923
<v Speaker 3>he came via Afghanistan to Egypt and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempt to cross that off our crossing </v>

304
00:13:58.201 --> 00:13:59.034
<v Speaker 3>into Gaza to teach us how to make bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was caught by the Egyptian </v>

305
00:14:02.581 --> 00:14:04.440
<v Speaker 3>authorities and they imprison them.</v>

306
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.440
<v Speaker 3>They sentenced him to 17 years and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>became friendly with this band and had a</v>

307
00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:12.390
<v Speaker 3>long conversation with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

308
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.480
<v Speaker 3>due to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the London bombings because,</v>

309
00:14:14.481 --> 00:14:16.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the invasion of Iraq happened when I was</v>

310
00:14:16.621 --> 00:14:17.454
<v Speaker 3>in prison and the London seven slash </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven attacks in London bombings and </v>

311
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.983
<v Speaker 3>sort of the buses and the tubes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>London also happened when I was in </v>

312
00:14:23.881 --> 00:14:25.710
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I locked it.</v>

313
00:14:25.711 --> 00:14:27.930
<v Speaker 3>I kind of got locked into a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with this,</v>

314
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.070
<v Speaker 3>with this man about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his view then legitimacy of attacking</v>

315
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.933
<v Speaker 3>London.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was attempting to convince him </v>

316
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.140
<v Speaker 3>that it wasn't legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now again,</v>

317
00:14:37.141 --> 00:14:40.050
<v Speaker 3>because I used to belong to a non </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorist yet revolution,</v>

318
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.433
<v Speaker 3>extreme Islamic group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't believe in jihad isn't input </v>

319
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.893
<v Speaker 3>to come to power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we were arguing with jihadists that </v>

320
00:14:47.251 --> 00:14:49.400
<v Speaker 3>actually what they should be focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a minute recoup.</v>

321
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I was opposing him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not I hadn't yet left.</v>

322
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.030
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't yet left Islam is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's because my form of Islam,</v>

323
00:14:55.031 --> 00:14:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Islam in its method have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

324
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.590
<v Speaker 3>it was very different to his and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of how it seeks to come to power.</v>

325
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.750
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one thing I,</v>

326
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:05.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really proud of is that here's a man</v>

327
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.340
<v Speaker 3>who was trained who was fully capable </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

328
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of making bombs and then causing mayhem,</v>

329
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.910
<v Speaker 3>mayhem and havoc yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

330
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:14.803
<v Speaker 3>when I put it to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the justification he uses to say </v>

331
00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:21.980
<v Speaker 3>that it's legitimate to target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just citizens in that they voted for</v>

332
00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:26.160
<v Speaker 3>their government would be the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>justification one could use for Tux.</v>

333
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.143
<v Speaker 3>So voted for their government in Turkey </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a member of NATO and NATO as an </v>

334
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:33.500
<v Speaker 3>alliance was involved in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

335
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 3>and so why wouldn't he be bumping </v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey?</v>

336
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his answer that he,</v>

337
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 3>the answer he gave me was a pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

338
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:41.324
<v Speaker 3>Not a religious one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at which point I called him out and I </v>

339
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:43.821
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>

340
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:44.654
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is you're playing </v>

341
00:15:45.201 --> 00:15:47.750
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're giving me a pragmatic answer,</v>

342
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 3>which is the very thing when Bush does </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

343
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:51.770
<v Speaker 3>you criticize Bush for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

344
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.960
<v Speaker 3>the upshot of that conversation was by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of it,</v>

345
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took him a couple of days or </v>

346
00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knocked on my,</v>

347
00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.260
<v Speaker 3>on my jail cell and he came back looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>really sheepish and he said,</v>

348
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:01.094
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about what you said </v>

349
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.751
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

350
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:05.240
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think I agree with you.</v>

351
00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:06.074
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not justifying to attack a British </v>

352
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:08.903
<v Speaker 3>civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that really swung </v>

353
00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:14.420
<v Speaker 3>him was the fact that so many in the UK </v>
<v Speaker 3>protested against the Iraq war.</v>

354
00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 3>So my argument to him was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you be attacking these people?</v>

355
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:18.891
<v Speaker 3>But I'm happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

356
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:19.724
<v Speaker 3>he changed his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where he is and what he's </v>

357
00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 3>doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

358
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:23.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

359
00:16:23.171 --> 00:16:26.180
<v Speaker 3>it's a small incremental step towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>peace and reconciliation.</v>

360
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:30.260
<v Speaker 3>And it was one of the first examples </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I felt sent me on the path that I'm</v>

361
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:30.840
<v Speaker 3>now on.</v>

362
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

363
00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:33.120
<v Speaker 2>that's why I wanted to ask you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because I,</v>

364
00:16:33.121 --> 00:16:33.954
<v Speaker 2>I love the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful story in it and it's </v>

365
00:16:35.551 --> 00:16:38.490
<v Speaker 2>about what I think your whole life now </v>
<v Speaker 2>is about,</v>

366
00:16:38.491 --> 00:16:39.324
<v Speaker 2>which is trying to explain all this to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and actually get people to </v>

367
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:43.704
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the problems we're </v>

368
00:16:44.881 --> 00:16:45.714
<v Speaker 2>really having here is that I see both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides on this or however many sides do </v>

369
00:16:49.051 --> 00:16:49.884
<v Speaker 2>you want to say there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see everybody sort of getting </v>

370
00:16:51.601 --> 00:16:54.810
<v Speaker 2>entrenched and the dialogue sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappearing.</v>

371
00:16:54.811 --> 00:16:55.644
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's a perfect segue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just coauthored a book with Sam </v>

372
00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.573
<v Speaker 2>Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Sam on the show a couple of weeks </v>

373
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:00.820
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

374
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.360
<v Speaker 2>it's called Islam and the future of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerance.</v>

375
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so first off,</v>

376
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.760
<v Speaker 2>I think people would love to know a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more about the nature of your</v>

377
00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.850
<v Speaker 2>relationship with Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you guys came together.</v>

378
00:17:11.851 --> 00:17:12.571
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

379
00:17:12.571 --> 00:17:14.610
<v Speaker 2>is a devout atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

380
00:17:14.611 --> 00:17:15.211
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

381
00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:16.620
<v Speaker 2>you're a practicing Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

382
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't call myself religious or devout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Muslim,</v>

383
00:17:20.371 --> 00:17:21.204
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't want to hold myself up as</v>
<v Speaker 3>any standard for anyone to judge the </v>

384
00:17:24.301 --> 00:17:25.560
<v Speaker 3>religion by or anything else.</v>

385
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:26.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

386
00:17:26.281 --> 00:17:27.114
<v Speaker 2>So that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me a little bit about how you got </v>

387
00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:29.814
<v Speaker 2>connected with Sam and what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought you two together to really go </v>

388
00:17:33.031 --> 00:17:34.260
<v Speaker 2>ahead and start doing things like this.</v>

389
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.030
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

390
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:36.863
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I first met a few years ago when I came </v>

391
00:17:39.761 --> 00:17:44.080
<v Speaker 3>to New York where I am right now to </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate a Ayaan Hirsi Ali.</v>

392
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.070
<v Speaker 3>And the motion of the debate was Islam </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a religion of peace.</v>

393
00:17:48.071 --> 00:17:48.904
<v Speaker 3>And there's something I need to clarify </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that debate is that I've never </v>

394
00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:53.334
<v Speaker 3>believed it's saying never sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my current incarnation off believing </v>

395
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his area,</v>

396
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I've not believed that Islam is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion of war or peace.</v>

397
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 3>And this is something I've been ending </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my dialogue with Sam.</v>

398
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.933
<v Speaker 3>I chose the side of that motion that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam is a religion of peace because </v>

399
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:09.324
<v Speaker 3>there was emotion and I had to choose </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was a religion of war or </v>

400
00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:12.654
<v Speaker 3>peace and pick a side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the emotion was worded </v>

401
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:16.400
<v Speaker 3>incorrectly frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

402
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.570
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

403
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.850
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

404
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:19.763
<v Speaker 3>there a religion of peace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a religion and religion's are </v>

405
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:23.830
<v Speaker 3>interpreted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

406
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.773
<v Speaker 3>but nevertheless I sat on the side that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a religion of peace because I </v>

407
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:28.014
<v Speaker 3>logically reason in my mind that if the </v>
<v Speaker 3>majority of Muslims today aren't </v>

408
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 3>jihadist or be at many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

409
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:33.504
<v Speaker 3>many Muslims are not liberal in the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to certainly not jihadist </v>

410
00:18:37.681 --> 00:18:38.400
<v Speaker 3>terrorists.</v>

411
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.140
<v Speaker 3>And so if religion is what people make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

412
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 3>if Islam is what Muslims interpret it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

413
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.220
<v Speaker 3>then by definition it's a religion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>peace simply because Muslims that are by</v>

414
00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 3>the overwhelming majority are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists.</v>

415
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.790
<v Speaker 3>So I sat on that side of the debate </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

416
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.800
<v Speaker 3>I debated him afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We ended up in the dinner afterwards and</v>

417
00:18:57.121 --> 00:18:57.954
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Sam who happened to be there and I </v>

418
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:01.020
<v Speaker 3>hadn't mentioned before and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

419
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:01.854
<v Speaker 3>he was called upon by a ions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will asked me a question and he asked </v>

420
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

421
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.760
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

422
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.593
<v Speaker 3>it's all good and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you being out there and needing to </v>

423
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:10.470
<v Speaker 3>present this view to the public about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam being this or that.</v>

424
00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:11.304
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

425
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.430
<v Speaker 3>here between us in the privacy of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this dinner,</v>

426
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:17.040
<v Speaker 3>can't you just be honest with us and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell us that,</v>

427
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.893
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you really think about Islam is a </v>

428
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:20.723
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>

429
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 3>So I want immediate reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was to say to him,</v>

430
00:19:23.971 --> 00:19:25.880
<v Speaker 3>are you accusing me of lying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

431
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.020
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I not be honest with you?</v>

432
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.000
<v Speaker 3>Are you implying that I wasn't honest </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside,</v>

433
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.760
<v Speaker 3>they're on the platform and it became a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

434
00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:33.603
<v Speaker 3>a hostile exchange which ended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it didn't go any further and </v>

435
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:38.320
<v Speaker 3>everyone was a bit embarrassed around </v>
<v Speaker 3>the table.</v>

436
00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:39.154
<v Speaker 3>We didn't really develop beyond that </v>
<v Speaker 3>point and then we didn't speak for a </v>

437
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 3>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

438
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.450
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then Sam reached out to me when I</v>

439
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:48.610
<v Speaker 3>think he'd watched me at the Richmond </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

440
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.083
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was reunited again where they on </v>

441
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.210
<v Speaker 3>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The good thing was,</v>

442
00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:56.970
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a conversation.</v>

443
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.970
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually the richmond </v>
<v Speaker 3>parameter.</v>

444
00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.843
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people from the Richmond form of </v>

445
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:01.434
<v Speaker 3>watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to thank them because the format </v>

446
00:20:03.361 --> 00:20:04.194
<v Speaker 3>that they got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same moderator John Donvan </v>

447
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 3>moderating the debate at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence squared,</v>

448
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.070
<v Speaker 3>a exhaust earlier on occasion.</v>

449
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:11.303
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

450
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.210
<v Speaker 3>but instead they got a on myself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Emam Ralph who had been the,</v>

451
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.353
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the email or the main Manhattan mosque </v>

452
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.860
<v Speaker 3>and instead of having a motion to </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate,</v>

453
00:20:19.861 --> 00:20:22.230
<v Speaker 3>they just said it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We only have to have a conversation.</v>

454
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.083
<v Speaker 3>So that really allowed for me to be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle because he was arguing Islam </v>

455
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:29.364
<v Speaker 3>as a religion of peace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost arguing it's not that it's a </v>

456
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:34.380
<v Speaker 3>religion of war instead and allowed me </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the center to say,</v>

457
00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:34.861
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

458
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:37.530
<v Speaker 3>actually I yarns got something right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got something right.</v>

459
00:20:37.531 --> 00:20:38.790
<v Speaker 3>And there's actually something in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle here.</v>

460
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:40.431
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

461
00:20:40.431 --> 00:20:44.040
<v Speaker 3>that I think that conversation really </v>
<v Speaker 3>set the precedent for what happened with</v>

462
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Santa me afterwards because I think he </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw that.</v>

463
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I think almost really impressed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

464
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.491
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

465
00:20:49.491 --> 00:20:49.971
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

466
00:20:49.971 --> 00:20:52.150
<v Speaker 3>the tone that I talked with her in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

467
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.150
<v Speaker 3>And I was really happy with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>research,</v>

468
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.053
<v Speaker 3>with the way in which we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she reciprocated my overtures to have </v>

469
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.110
<v Speaker 3>because I think that really laid the </v>
<v Speaker 3>foundations for what happened next.</v>

470
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:03.670
<v Speaker 3>And then Sam reached out to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

471
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.830
<v Speaker 3>can we kind of have that type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation for my blog?</v>

472
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:08.231
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

473
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 3>he interviews people on his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he publishes it on his blog.</v>

474
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.293
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

475
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

476
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:13.900
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

477
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.640
<v Speaker 3>we sort of had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

478
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.793
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exchange over the phone and he </v>

479
00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:19.780
<v Speaker 3>transcribed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

480
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is actually really good.</v>

481
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:22.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should put it on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>blog.</v>

482
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I actually sensed this is a book that </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets,</v>

483
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:24.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could really influence a lot of </v>

484
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:26.690
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

485
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.640
<v Speaker 3>and so then he approached a Harvard and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

486
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.980
<v Speaker 3>I called the editor in chief at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

487
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.910
<v Speaker 3>agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

488
00:21:32.911 --> 00:21:33.744
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the story of the book which hits </v>

489
00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:35.554
<v Speaker 3>the shelves in a week.</v>

490
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

491
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.180
<v Speaker 2>so we'll talk about more about Sam in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

492
00:21:38.181 --> 00:21:41.090
<v Speaker 2>But I think something interesting that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you said about Ian is that,</v>

493
00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:41.924
<v Speaker 2>so I think a lot of your critics are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the people that are critical of </v>

494
00:21:45.021 --> 00:21:48.250
<v Speaker 2>everyone on your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your side of this is that,</v>

495
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.930
<v Speaker 2>that you guys all think exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

496
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.580
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm fascinated that.</v>

497
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.780
<v Speaker 2>So you and I actually don't agree on </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain elements of this.</v>

498
00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.081
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>

499
00:21:58.081 --> 00:22:01.650
<v Speaker 3>that's the laziness and the knee jerk </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction,</v>

500
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.350
<v Speaker 3>the emotional reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is born of fear,</v>

501
00:22:04.351 --> 00:22:05.184
<v Speaker 3>the fear of dialogue and a fear of </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually having conversations with </v>

502
00:22:07.231 --> 00:22:08.080
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

503
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.173
<v Speaker 3>that we may disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that actually the best way to ignore </v>

504
00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:15.770
<v Speaker 3>the consequences that dialogue can work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tiny share,</v>

505
00:22:15.771 --> 00:22:18.330
<v Speaker 3>everyone with the same brush and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

506
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.373
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

507
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 3>effectively slander everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

508
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.260
<v Speaker 3>and that way that we are justifying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves and those who are listening to</v>

509
00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:28.950
<v Speaker 3>us why dialogue isn't a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is that,</v>

510
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even after this dial this,</v>

511
00:22:31.091 --> 00:22:31.924
<v Speaker 3>and there are probably many things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he and I don't see eye to eye on him </v>

512
00:22:34.651 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 3>with a on as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

513
00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.123
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the important thing is in </v>

514
00:22:38.491 --> 00:22:41.710
<v Speaker 3>recognizing that dialogue is a process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>

515
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.541
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

516
00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:44.610
<v Speaker 3>you don't just snap your fingers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody agrees with you.</v>

517
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and democracy itself,</v>

518
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:47.574
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal democracies weren't born in a </v>

519
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.773
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why we use the word mature </v>

520
00:22:53.281 --> 00:22:55.650
<v Speaker 3>democracies will be referred to </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries like United States.</v>

521
00:22:55.651 --> 00:22:56.484
<v Speaker 3>The United Kingdom is because they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>had centuries over which time they've </v>

522
00:22:59.371 --> 00:23:02.150
<v Speaker 3>matured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the kids use.</v>

523
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.993
<v Speaker 3>That analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what a dialogue with </v>

524
00:23:03.961 --> 00:23:06.420
<v Speaker 3>people you disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they hadn't matures over time.</v>

525
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.363
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's been a bunch of people you </v>

526
00:23:08.751 --> 00:23:09.584
<v Speaker 2>can name them if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about them a lot here and </v>

527
00:23:10.941 --> 00:23:11.774
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost tired of talking about them </v>

528
00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:17.090
<v Speaker 2>at this point who are writing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty horrific things about you,</v>

529
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.081
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

530
00:23:18.081 --> 00:23:18.914
<v Speaker 2>the worst kind of slanderous stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling you names that if anyone on the </v>

531
00:23:22.491 --> 00:23:24.860
<v Speaker 2>right called you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be condemned.</v>

532
00:23:24.861 --> 00:23:26.240
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rightfully so,</v>

533
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.373
<v Speaker 2>and I'm seeing so much of this coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the left and these are the people </v>

534
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.693
<v Speaker 2>who I thought would be the one standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up for all the things that you're </v>

535
00:23:34.791 --> 00:23:36.440
<v Speaker 2>talking about here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the words that you're talking about,</v>

536
00:23:36.441 --> 00:23:38.360
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalism,</v>

537
00:23:38.361 --> 00:23:40.520
<v Speaker 2>all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

538
00:23:40.521 --> 00:23:42.140
<v Speaker 2>and you're getting it from the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

539
00:23:42.141 --> 00:23:43.190
<v Speaker 2>what do you make about that?</v>

540
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.390
<v Speaker 3>So let's away from the individuals and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at the movement and,</v>

541
00:23:48.391 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

542
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.120
<v Speaker 3>the individuals at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

543
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.013
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever they say about me and wherever </v>

544
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:55.350
<v Speaker 3>they are and have used a certainly one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

545
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.203
<v Speaker 3>as bad as I was when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary Islam is so I hope they </v>

546
00:23:58.431 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 3>can change you're a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I believe in change and I hope that</v>

547
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.510
<v Speaker 3>people adapt turned into phase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they do change their views,</v>

548
00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I'd be perfectly happy to continue being</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with them.</v>

549
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:08.534
<v Speaker 3>And Reza Aslan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who used to sit on my organization's </v>

550
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:15.380
<v Speaker 3>board in London as a member of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>advisory council and we disbanded it,</v>

551
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years into a founding organization.</v>

552
00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:20.780
<v Speaker 3>So it hasn't existed for about five </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

553
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:21.530
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

554
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.311
<v Speaker 3>we used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another guy,</v>

555
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 3>we invited him to London for a foot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's spoken at my offices in London,</v>

556
00:24:26.571 --> 00:24:26.990
<v Speaker 3>acquit him.</v>

557
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.771
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

558
00:24:27.771 --> 00:24:28.604
<v Speaker 3>people change and I'm hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm hoping that we can resume of </v>

559
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.100
<v Speaker 3>accordion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a form of relationship with all of these</v>

560
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:34.934
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

561
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.833
<v Speaker 3>I just think that if I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can be a go from where I was to </v>

562
00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.700
<v Speaker 3>where I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have faith in humanity.</v>

563
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.343
<v Speaker 3>But it is important to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>concepts because that's the only way </v>

564
00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 3>people do change by the way is when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as happened with me,</v>

565
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.970
<v Speaker 3>is when those ideas are challenged and </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that tries.</v>

566
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:54.680
<v Speaker 3>And it's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all human beings.</v>

567
00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:57.200
<v Speaker 3>We all have emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will have egos,</v>

568
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.160
<v Speaker 3>but in a way to challenge those ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>without making about the ego because,</v>

569
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:04.520
<v Speaker 3>but actually just really making it about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the concepts themselves.</v>

570
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.533
<v Speaker 3>And so what you've referred to is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've come to refer to as the regressive </v>

571
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:09.240
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

572
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.870
<v Speaker 3>and what I mean by the regressive left </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because they're,</v>

573
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all of the people on the left wing,</v>

574
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.620
<v Speaker 3>progressive leftists are just like not </v>
<v Speaker 3>all Muslims are Islamists.</v>

575
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:23.420
<v Speaker 3>And so what I mean by the regressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>left Aba is this phenomenon of people on</v>

576
00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:28.421
<v Speaker 3>the left wing of the debate who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who see between their duty,</v>

577
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.880
<v Speaker 3>their ideological duty to challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

578
00:25:32.881 --> 00:25:35.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy mistakes,</v>

579
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.280
<v Speaker 3>American and British foreign policy </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistakes.</v>

580
00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:38.114
<v Speaker 3>So what they interpret as colonialism </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the color and they conservativism </v>

581
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.780
<v Speaker 3>they see it as their duty is challenged </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

582
00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:49.520
<v Speaker 3>And then they see another challenge </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is theocracies and uh,</v>

583
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.800
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Islamist ideology and they,</v>

584
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.050
<v Speaker 3>they have come to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've come to the,</v>

585
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:54.923
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the view that you can't challenge </v>

586
00:25:56.331 --> 00:25:59.870
<v Speaker 3>both of these together because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were to challenge his limits theocracy,</v>

587
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.990
<v Speaker 3>your are your supporting neoconservative</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy.</v>

588
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.490
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their minds,</v>

589
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.860
<v Speaker 3>they prioritized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've said,</v>

590
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neoconservative foreign policies and </v>

591
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.073
<v Speaker 3>bigger evil organized violence and chaos</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the form of military invasions is </v>

592
00:26:14.511 --> 00:26:17.660
<v Speaker 3>worse than randomized nonstate act of </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence and chaos.</v>

593
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:18.883
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to go after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they believe they're engaged in a </v>

594
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:22.910
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go after the,</v>

595
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.773
<v Speaker 3>this is their mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go after the organized </v>

596
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.143
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why sometimes you see </v>

597
00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:29.024
<v Speaker 3>duplicity in their statements is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they genuinely believe it's an </v>

598
00:26:31.371 --> 00:26:32.204
<v Speaker 3>ideological war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's necessary to even engage in </v>

599
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:39.230
<v Speaker 3>propaganda to defeat this bigger evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we believe in which is the organized</v>

600
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:42.320
<v Speaker 3>violence and war now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so why I call them aggressive.</v>

601
00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.053
<v Speaker 3>It was because in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make alliances with some of the </v>

602
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:48.840
<v Speaker 3>most regressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>theocratic,</v>

603
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.460
<v Speaker 3>fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian,</v>

604
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.860
<v Speaker 3>barbaric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>murdering,</v>

605
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 3>and justifies of murderous regimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the world,</v>

606
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

607
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.433
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Hezbollah terrorist </v>

608
00:27:00.571 --> 00:27:03.950
<v Speaker 3>organization that's county fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>alongside the dictator asset and,</v>

609
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.273
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fight with a against the Syrian </v>

610
00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:07.884
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I use the example of his </v>

611
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.960
<v Speaker 3>mom because the man has just been </v>
<v Speaker 3>elected to the,</v>

612
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 3>to the Labour party leadership in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United Kingdom,</v>

613
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.270
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

614
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.150
<v Speaker 3>who's actually born on this regressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>left phenomenon has,</v>

615
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.013
<v Speaker 3>has been a historically has been very </v>
<v Speaker 3>close to groups such as support groups </v>

616
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.710
<v Speaker 3>such as his Blah [inaudible].</v>

617
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.240
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I'm siting in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>

618
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.890
<v Speaker 3>So when was his beloved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Hummus,</v>

619
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the one hand I can see the </v>

620
00:27:32.191 --> 00:27:33.024
<v Speaker 3>frustration of people who want a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a two state solution which includes a </v>

621
00:27:37.851 --> 00:27:38.684
<v Speaker 3>secure free and independent Israel and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>secure and free and independent </v>

622
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:42.894
<v Speaker 3>Palestine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that frustration shouldn't </v>

623
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 3>legitimize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

624
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.793
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>supporting an organization that has at </v>

625
00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:49.734
<v Speaker 3>the heart of its policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the legitimization of targeting </v>

626
00:27:52.381 --> 00:27:53.214
<v Speaker 3>civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what's happened is when I called </v>

627
00:27:55.251 --> 00:27:56.084
<v Speaker 3>the regressive is that they've allied in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are anti colonial prioritization </v>

628
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.073
<v Speaker 3>with some of the most regressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>theocratic organizations that are out </v>

629
00:28:03.841 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 3>there in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

630
00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.740
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they feel it,</v>

631
00:28:06.741 --> 00:28:08.530
<v Speaker 3>they feel that anyone who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

632
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.473
<v Speaker 3>who criticizes those organizations is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is by definition with the </v>

633
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:14.550
<v Speaker 3>neoconservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they must attack them.</v>

634
00:28:14.551 --> 00:28:16.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I take the view,</v>

635
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:17.403
<v Speaker 3>actually you can criticize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I opposed the Iraq war and the invasion </v>

636
00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:21.234
<v Speaker 3>of Iraq from my jail cell in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have never supported the invasion of </v>

637
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never supported a conservativism on</v>

638
00:28:27.631 --> 00:28:29.460
<v Speaker 3>a member of the Liberal Democrats in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>UK.</v>

639
00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:31.950
<v Speaker 3>I've never been a member of any </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative party,</v>

640
00:28:31.951 --> 00:28:33.700
<v Speaker 3>I've never been a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

641
00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.760
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or supporter of wars in that sense in my</v>

642
00:28:35.761 --> 00:28:36.510
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

643
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.210
<v Speaker 3>so you can oppose those things at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>

644
00:28:39.211 --> 00:28:40.044
<v Speaker 3>You can oppose a theocratic fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can haul two thoughts at the same </v>

645
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.670
<v Speaker 3>time and it's not impossible to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I encourage everyone to try it.</v>

646
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love how you wrap that together </v>

647
00:28:49.421 --> 00:28:52.280
<v Speaker 2>because you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's two thoughts at the same time.</v>

648
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.370
<v Speaker 2>And when I talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're Sam,</v>

649
00:28:54.371 --> 00:28:55.204
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was saying that they want to find </v>

650
00:28:55.841 --> 00:29:00.340
<v Speaker 2>this nugget in you and once they find </v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing that they say you have,</v>

651
00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.860
<v Speaker 2>not that you say you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that they say you have,</v>

652
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:07.060
<v Speaker 2>then it's somehow discounts every other </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal principle that you have,</v>

653
00:29:07.061 --> 00:29:07.894
<v Speaker 2>which is why suddenly I'm hearing from </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that they'll call Bill Maher is </v>

654
00:29:10.931 --> 00:29:11.764
<v Speaker 2>suddenly a neo-con Bill Maher who has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think stood for every liberal </v>

655
00:29:14.951 --> 00:29:18.160
<v Speaker 2>principle been against every war that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can possibly think of.</v>

656
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.223
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have a suspicion that </v>

657
00:29:21.611 --> 00:29:23.740
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what these guys are doing,</v>

658
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I think for the reasons that you laid </v>
<v Speaker 2>out very well,</v>

659
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I think they're actually strengthening </v>
<v Speaker 2>the extremists on both sides,</v>

660
00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:33.843
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they are strengthening the </v>

661
00:29:35.141 --> 00:29:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Islamist extremists because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging them.</v>

662
00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.570
<v Speaker 2>And then they're strengthening the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

663
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.840
<v Speaker 2>the extremists because they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making it seem like there's this</v>

664
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 2>one set of ideas that can't be talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

665
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 2>And secular people want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>all ideas,</v>

666
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:49.864
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

667
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.941
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>

668
00:29:50.941 --> 00:29:54.780
<v Speaker 3>if we have come to refer to this as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>voldemort effect,</v>

669
00:29:54.781 --> 00:29:55.830
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

670
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.680
<v Speaker 3>it's the Harry Potter books in which I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>a j,</v>

671
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.820
<v Speaker 3>a k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she devices really clever mechanism.</v>

672
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 3>The people in the story are so fearful </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the evil of voldemort that two things</v>

673
00:30:09.061 --> 00:30:09.894
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

674
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.170
<v Speaker 3>they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't read,</v>

675
00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.980
<v Speaker 3>they don't believe ultimately is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually alive.</v>

676
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.903
<v Speaker 3>They think he's dead and they refuse to </v>
<v Speaker 3>admit accept anyone that's telling them </v>

677
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.650
<v Speaker 3>to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One still lives on.</v>

678
00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:24.270
<v Speaker 3>The second is that they're so petrified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or this photo who they believe is dead,</v>

679
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can't even name him.</v>

680
00:30:26.071 --> 00:30:28.020
<v Speaker 3>So they refer to him as he who must not </v>
<v Speaker 3>be named.</v>

681
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:29.523
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's what I mean is the votable </v>

682
00:30:31.621 --> 00:30:32.940
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that leads to,</v>

683
00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:33.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you can't name something that </v>

684
00:30:34.651 --> 00:30:38.790
<v Speaker 3>actually is staring at you in the face </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're so scared of it,</v>

685
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.850
<v Speaker 3>but you deny exists and you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to name it.</v>

686
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.390
<v Speaker 3>That increases the hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

687
00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when president trump says we must defeat</v>

688
00:30:47.911 --> 00:30:50.750
<v Speaker 3>the evil ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well which evil ideology,</v>

689
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

690
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:52.363
<v Speaker 3>and so then you mean the average dude </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stands up in Donald Trump's rally </v>

691
00:30:54.871 --> 00:30:57.030
<v Speaker 3>and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when are we going to deal with America's</v>

692
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Muslim problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or Carson who says,</v>

693
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.333
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't want a Muslim president when </v>

694
00:31:01.411 --> 00:31:03.570
<v Speaker 3>they say these things because the evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology,</v>

695
00:31:03.571 --> 00:31:06.300
<v Speaker 3>when they hear that word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they mean by that is Islam.</v>

696
00:31:06.301 --> 00:31:09.300
<v Speaker 3>And by default,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every Muslim who identifies with Islam,</v>

697
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.460
<v Speaker 3>which is why they don't want to Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

698
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.890
<v Speaker 3>So what we're doing is by blurring those</v>
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>

699
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:14.933
<v Speaker 3>we're increasing that hysteria and </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually the fee and the bigotry that </v>

700
00:31:18.601 --> 00:31:19.434
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I argue is for those two </v>

701
00:31:21.781 --> 00:31:25.560
<v Speaker 3>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually more importantly to empower</v>

702
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:30.120
<v Speaker 3>a reforming Muslim voices within Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities because the first victims of</v>

703
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.330
<v Speaker 3>theocratic fascism will be those Muslims</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

704
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.040
<v Speaker 3>It will be the Muslim women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be the,</v>

705
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the minorities.</v>

706
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.103
<v Speaker 3>So the Yazidi women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be the Coptic Christians in </v>

707
00:31:39.301 --> 00:31:41.160
<v Speaker 3>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be the liberal Muslims,</v>

708
00:31:41.161 --> 00:31:42.750
<v Speaker 3>it'll be the apostates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ex Muslims,</v>

709
00:31:42.751 --> 00:31:45.420
<v Speaker 3>there'll be the game Muslims and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lesbian Muslims.</v>

710
00:31:45.421 --> 00:31:47.000
<v Speaker 3>These are the ones who first suffer </v>
<v Speaker 3>under,</v>

711
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.843
<v Speaker 3>under the yoke of the aquatic fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to also provide them with a </v>

712
00:31:50.991 --> 00:31:54.750
<v Speaker 3>lexicon that they can deploy it in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>own internal reform debates.</v>

713
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.060
<v Speaker 3>So if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't recognize Islam,</v>

714
00:31:57.061 --> 00:31:58.050
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they going to say?</v>

715
00:31:58.051 --> 00:32:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Is the problem when they're having these</v>
<v Speaker 3>debates within their communities,</v>

716
00:32:00.391 --> 00:32:01.224
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the religion that's going to get them </v>

717
00:32:02.161 --> 00:32:05.070
<v Speaker 3>killed immediately in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aside from the,</v>

718
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intellectual point that.</v>

719
00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:07.224
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by Islam and religion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interpreted in a million different </v>

720
00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:09.894
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

721
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

722
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.133
<v Speaker 2>That that's such a good handle on why </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so difficult because we're </v>

723
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.100
<v Speaker 2>talking about ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about people,</v>

724
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:16.934
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a political </v>

725
00:32:18.021 --> 00:32:21.520
<v Speaker 2>movements is just so much at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

726
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.440
<v Speaker 2>so just to sort of re,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

727
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.640
<v Speaker 2>just to bring around this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this part of it,</v>

728
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of dealing with these people,</v>

729
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.300
<v Speaker 2>the people that have been writing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things and all that.</v>

730
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.960
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how personally exhausting is it for you?</v>

731
00:32:35.961 --> 00:32:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Because I see and I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

732
00:32:37.461 --> 00:32:38.390
<v Speaker 2>where Sam has said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

733
00:32:38.391 --> 00:32:40.550
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said to me,</v>

734
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:41.384
<v Speaker 2>even that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then suddenly it's like he has to say </v>

735
00:32:42.981 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 2>something because it's not fun being </v>
<v Speaker 2>lied about or slandered or smeared.</v>

736
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as I said before you and away get it</v>

737
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:49.334
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tweet by one of these guys just this </v>

738
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 2>week to you was about how he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>report you to the Department of Homeland</v>

739
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.223
<v Speaker 2>Security when you come to the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States because he doesn't want an x </v>

740
00:32:58.881 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 2>terrorist here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is really horrible.</v>

741
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:03.950
<v Speaker 2>So how do you just deal with it on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the personal level?</v>

742
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Speaker 2>It's exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

743
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.913
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing with this tweet is really </v>

744
00:33:07.931 --> 00:33:09.970
<v Speaker 3>raises an interesting insight and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

745
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.520
<v Speaker 3>I hope this guy changes his approach to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

746
00:33:12.521 --> 00:33:16.240
<v Speaker 3>but the interesting thing this raises </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

747
00:33:16.241 --> 00:33:20.320
<v Speaker 3>is a liberal guy who extensively opposes</v>
<v Speaker 3>profiling at airports,</v>

748
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.330
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always done,</v>

749
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I've always been a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

750
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.310
<v Speaker 3>you can find more that I've done against</v>
<v Speaker 3>profiling then any of these voices,</v>

751
00:33:27.311 --> 00:33:28.144
<v Speaker 3>if you Google Google on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole debate on that on BBC </v>

752
00:33:31.031 --> 00:33:31.864
<v Speaker 3>news night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the flagship news show in the </v>

753
00:33:32.861 --> 00:33:37.300
<v Speaker 3>UK against the left wing Labor policy </v>
<v Speaker 3>member of parliament who also happens to</v>

754
00:33:37.301 --> 00:33:40.090
<v Speaker 3>be Muslim who was advocating profiling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

755
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.700
<v Speaker 3>five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was debating him on that.</v>

756
00:33:42.701 --> 00:33:43.091
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

757
00:33:43.091 --> 00:33:46.390
<v Speaker 3>this is a city idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've always been against profiling.</v>

758
00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:49.810
<v Speaker 3>But so was this guy who sent the tweet </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just referred to get.</v>

759
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.123
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting is suddenly when </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody is breaking out of the group </v>

760
00:33:55.931 --> 00:33:59.500
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think and disassociating themselves with</v>

761
00:33:59.501 --> 00:34:01.090
<v Speaker 3>the tribal identity that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

762
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:03.570
<v Speaker 3>that we use to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

763
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 3>to have this us and them kind of gaining</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

764
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.540
<v Speaker 3>that we referred to earlier that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

765
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:09.280
<v Speaker 3>you're either with the neocons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you with us,</v>

766
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.433
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of awesome them relies on </v>

767
00:34:12.491 --> 00:34:13.324
<v Speaker 3>this tribal identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When someone breaks free from that </v>

768
00:34:16.301 --> 00:34:19.180
<v Speaker 3>tribal identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>refuses to belong here or there,</v>

769
00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:20.403
<v Speaker 3>suddenly you find that it's open season,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all the principles that we use to </v>

770
00:34:24.131 --> 00:34:28.390
<v Speaker 3>actually tarnish the neocons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neocons who want to profile Muslims,</v>

771
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.343
<v Speaker 3>it's the neocons who are racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're using that same racism against </v>

772
00:34:32.741 --> 00:34:35.110
<v Speaker 3>those dissenting voices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was called a porch monkey,</v>

773
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was called a native informant.</v>

774
00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:41.200
<v Speaker 3>I was called a Muslim by white non </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslims in this instance,</v>

775
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:42.893
<v Speaker 2>really reputable people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just random eggs on twitter </v>

776
00:34:44.821 --> 00:34:45.471
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

777
00:34:45.471 --> 00:34:45.600
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

778
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:45.901
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

779
00:34:45.901 --> 00:34:46.734
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are journeys that worked for </v>

780
00:34:47.401 --> 00:34:48.234
<v Speaker 3>established,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

781
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.670
<v Speaker 3>organizations with lightfoot established</v>
<v Speaker 3>blogs.</v>

782
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.430
<v Speaker 3>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've just mentioned somebody saying,</v>

783
00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.353
<v Speaker 3>I hope dhs reads that department phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It reads your book before you come to </v>

784
00:34:57.961 --> 00:34:58.794
<v Speaker 3>the states because I don't want an x </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists coming into the into the </v>

785
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.520
<v Speaker 3>United States and put aside the fact I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was never a terrorist.</v>

786
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.773
<v Speaker 3>That's advocating profiling by somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>who a literally a day earlier had been </v>

787
00:35:11.911 --> 00:35:15.600
<v Speaker 3>on CNN accusing Sam Harris of advocating</v>
<v Speaker 3>profiling.</v>

788
00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:16.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

789
00:35:16.891 --> 00:35:20.200
<v Speaker 3>so it's suddenly what happens is when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you break away from that group,</v>

790
00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.053
<v Speaker 3>a kind of tribal group think it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>open season and that's why I said </v>

791
00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:26.124
<v Speaker 3>earlier that I think what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>here is they genuinely believe they're </v>

792
00:35:28.981 --> 00:35:29.814
<v Speaker 3>engaged in a war and so in a war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these tactics become legitimate </v>

793
00:35:33.241 --> 00:35:35.730
<v Speaker 3>because the objective is to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not to find the truth,</v>

794
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.710
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's of the problem.</v>

795
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.543
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think this dialogue and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this conversation is so important </v>

796
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.050
<v Speaker 3>because what we do is we break down that</v>
<v Speaker 3>hostility,</v>

797
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.033
<v Speaker 3>so I keep referring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why actually it's a lesson to </v>

798
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:46.494
<v Speaker 3>myself as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so important to remain polite with </v>

799
00:35:48.061 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 3>these guys because whenever they say to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

800
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:52.163
<v Speaker 3>if I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I reinforce that notion that they've </v>

801
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 3>somehow managed to convince themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is a war,</v>

802
00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.193
<v Speaker 3>and if I respond in that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will double down and they will </v>

803
00:36:00.481 --> 00:36:03.540
<v Speaker 3>continue to act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a war and that anything is,</v>

804
00:36:03.541 --> 00:36:03.991
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

805
00:36:03.991 --> 00:36:05.400
<v Speaker 3>is permissible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

806
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I try and,</v>

807
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:09.420
<v Speaker 3>and deescalated and I fail sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

808
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:10.830
<v Speaker 3>it's important for me to keep trying.</v>

809
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel the same way I,</v>

810
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:13.314
<v Speaker 2>I try as well from the little piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this that I'm part of and I've tried to </v>

811
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:19.680
<v Speaker 2>engage some of these people in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>respectful way and unfortunately,</v>

812
00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:21.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Sam as illustrated quite well,</v>

813
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.613
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to debate when you have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts and then the person you're </v>

814
00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:28.680
<v Speaker 2>debating is debating what they think you</v>
<v Speaker 2>say or what they want you to say.</v>

815
00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not what you,</v>

816
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.250
<v Speaker 2>what you actually say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

817
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a little bit of this also is </v>

818
00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:39.141
<v Speaker 2>what Bill Maher refers to as the bigotry</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the soft bigotry of low expectations.</v>

819
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that somehow these people,</v>

820
00:36:43.381 --> 00:36:46.530
<v Speaker 2>and again I'm talking about the white </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals in this group,</v>

821
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.633
<v Speaker 2>that they think because you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently than they want you to think </v>

822
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:54.330
<v Speaker 2>that that shows racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

823
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.320
<v Speaker 3>You could call right now into your show </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

824
00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.700
<v Speaker 3>when you do your production,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

825
00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:05.060
<v Speaker 3>an image of me talking me talking to Sam</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris and,</v>

826
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.990
<v Speaker 3>and being quarter porch monkey for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

827
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to Morgan Freeman now.</v>

828
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.380
<v Speaker 3>Now the question I ask is why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would none of these guys in and they</v>

829
00:37:14.381 --> 00:37:15.214
<v Speaker 3>haven't done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why would any of these guys not </v>

830
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.650
<v Speaker 3>cormier porch monkey for talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Morgan Freeman?</v>

831
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:22.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not call me his native informant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

832
00:37:22.571 --> 00:37:25.720
<v Speaker 3>Call me his porch monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet when I'm talking to a white man,</v>

833
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.470
<v Speaker 3>his porch monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call me his native informant.</v>

834
00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the racism of low expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the assumption is that when a brown</v>

835
00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:36.370
<v Speaker 3>man is talking to a brown man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a meeting of equals.</v>

836
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.570
<v Speaker 3>But when a brown man is talking to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white land,</v>

837
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.423
<v Speaker 3>the Brown man suddenly loses all agency </v>
<v Speaker 3>and can't think for himself and his </v>

838
00:37:42.131 --> 00:37:43.450
<v Speaker 3>following the white man's thoughts.</v>

839
00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.673
<v Speaker 3>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the irony is that I don't even use that </v>

840
00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:48.220
<v Speaker 3>form of identity politics to describe </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

841
00:37:48.221 --> 00:37:51.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't see people as white people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown people I see effectively I use,</v>

842
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.100
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like people to look at people as their</v>

843
00:37:54.101 --> 00:37:54.671
<v Speaker 3>values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

844
00:37:54.671 --> 00:37:56.560
<v Speaker 3>if someone's liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone's Islamist,</v>

845
00:37:56.561 --> 00:37:59.860
<v Speaker 3>if someone's a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I look at people.</v>

846
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it,</v>

847
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.870
<v Speaker 3>it tells me where I stand with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a much more than skin color does,</v>

848
00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:08.830
<v Speaker 3>but these are the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are ostensibly anti racist,</v>

849
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.740
<v Speaker 3>deploying that full of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you will find that,</v>

850
00:38:11.741 --> 00:38:12.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted the,</v>

851
00:38:12.521 --> 00:38:15.250
<v Speaker 3>an image of Morgan Freeman and nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday.</v>

852
00:38:15.251 --> 00:38:16.084
<v Speaker 3>I'm putting it on my facebook page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not once heard any reaction from </v>

853
00:38:19.181 --> 00:38:21.460
<v Speaker 3>any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a regressive left phenomenon,</v>

854
00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:22.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

855
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:23.860
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sense of being cold,</v>

856
00:38:23.861 --> 00:38:27.250
<v Speaker 3>his native informant or his house or his</v>
<v Speaker 3>porch monkey.</v>

857
00:38:27.251 --> 00:38:28.084
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't simply hasn't happened and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is a best example of the </v>

858
00:38:31.151 --> 00:38:32.860
<v Speaker 3>reverse racism of low expectations.</v>

859
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had been using the regressive left </v>

860
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:37.920
<v Speaker 2>also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just started using it in,</v>

861
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 2>in the last few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a few of my friends that are in this</v>

862
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 2>space aren't thrilled with me because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

863
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:47.740
<v Speaker 2>but I think what you're exposing there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fatal flaw of progressivism because</v>

864
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:51.100
<v Speaker 2>they view things in the prism of </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity politics.</v>

865
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:52.143
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to extricate someone with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a separate idea or someone that doesn't </v>

866
00:38:56.471 --> 00:39:00.880
<v Speaker 2>fit the cliche and you're literally a </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking,</v>

867
00:39:00.881 --> 00:39:03.950
<v Speaker 2>breathing example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is explains why you get the,</v>

868
00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.020
<v Speaker 2>the shit that you do.</v>

869
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.513
<v Speaker 3>And it's important to mention at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time when I'm sitting there on a </v>

870
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.050
<v Speaker 3>tweet out that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

871
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.530
<v Speaker 3>I was Morgan Freeman in the mosque </v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining,</v>

872
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a conversation about the </v>

873
00:39:16.731 --> 00:39:19.280
<v Speaker 3>difference between Islam and Islamism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is important to mentioned.</v>

874
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.610
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time I got lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction from people saying,</v>

875
00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:24.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between Islam and Islam.</v>

876
00:39:24.561 --> 00:39:28.220
<v Speaker 3>Islam is in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually in the same thing.</v>

877
00:39:28.221 --> 00:39:30.110
<v Speaker 3>So there's also that side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction,</v>

878
00:39:30.111 --> 00:39:31.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd get it from that side too.</v>

879
00:39:31.311 --> 00:39:35.090
<v Speaker 3>People insisting that Islam is what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it to be,</v>

880
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.133
<v Speaker 3>which is what are kind of in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm just engaged myself in a </v>

881
00:39:39.441 --> 00:39:41.600
<v Speaker 3>form of apology for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for what Islam is.</v>

882
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:42.640
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

883
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.870
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult to try and strike this </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance where,</v>

884
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.741
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

885
00:39:45.741 --> 00:39:50.080
<v Speaker 3>we need honesty in this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need people to accept that there's a,</v>

886
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.063
<v Speaker 3>a problem with Islamist extremism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also in fact a challenge in </v>

887
00:39:55.221 --> 00:39:56.190
<v Speaker 3>dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

888
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.133
<v Speaker 3>taking Islam out of its medieval heyday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the paradigms and the theological </v>

889
00:40:00.171 --> 00:40:01.004
<v Speaker 3>paradigms that were developed in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier that we simply haven't moved on </v>

890
00:40:03.081 --> 00:40:03.914
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

891
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.113
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually that means that a whole </v>

892
00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:09.830
<v Speaker 3>bunch of Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Islam is obviously don't write me</v>

893
00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.813
<v Speaker 3>a whole bunch of traditionalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>non Islamist conservative Muslims don't </v>

894
00:40:14.091 --> 00:40:14.924
<v Speaker 3>like me because I talk about reforming </v>
<v Speaker 3>the interpretation and then a whole </v>

895
00:40:17.331 --> 00:40:18.164
<v Speaker 3>bunch of anti Muslim people on the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>side who want me to apostasizes don't </v>

896
00:40:20.661 --> 00:40:23.590
<v Speaker 3>write me because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I say Islam can be interpreted a</v>

897
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.400
<v Speaker 3>and they want me to say that Islam is </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil.</v>

898
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:26.331
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

899
00:40:26.331 --> 00:40:27.164
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ended up getting kind of stuck in </v>

900
00:40:27.711 --> 00:40:29.690
<v Speaker 3>this middle of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It requires a lot of patients.</v>

901
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

902
00:40:30.431 --> 00:40:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I guess if you have a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>hating,</v>

903
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 2>you might be telling the truth.</v>

904
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:37.240
<v Speaker 3>How about you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to be a believer in Islam</v>

905
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.343
<v Speaker 3>to concede the point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the point I was making with </v>

906
00:40:40.391 --> 00:40:41.224
<v Speaker 3>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I think has since shifted in his </v>

907
00:40:42.221 --> 00:40:45.430
<v Speaker 3>view and he's accepted that he's feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>has changed somewhat on this point.</v>

908
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:46.653
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to be a believer in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion of Islam to concede that texts </v>

909
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:53.230
<v Speaker 3>can be interpreted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not as simple as saying,</v>

910
00:40:53.231 --> 00:40:54.064
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to a restaurant and </v>
<v Speaker 3>order a lobster and if you bring me a </v>

911
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.333
<v Speaker 3>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did you bring the chicken when I </v>

912
00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.850
<v Speaker 3>wanted a lobster?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's got the menu says mobster.</v>

913
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.983
<v Speaker 3>You're ordering one thing that what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about is a Amandla bit </v>

914
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.213
<v Speaker 3>like a car manual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When something's gone wrong in the </v>

915
00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:11.140
<v Speaker 3>engine and reading the whole thing or </v>
<v Speaker 3>working out what the diagnosis is,</v>

916
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 3>you know where the particular relevant </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts are,</v>

917
00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:14.560
<v Speaker 3>how you put them together.</v>

918
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.870
<v Speaker 3>When you're talking about complex ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

919
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.590
<v Speaker 3>like interpreting scripture and adapting</v>
<v Speaker 3>them to the time and space,</v>

920
00:41:20.591 --> 00:41:22.120
<v Speaker 3>we find ourselves in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

921
00:41:22.121 --> 00:41:22.954
<v Speaker 3>by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an exercise in interpretation and </v>

922
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:26.620
<v Speaker 3>that's why even with the US </v>
<v Speaker 3>Constitution,</v>

923
00:41:26.621 --> 00:41:27.454
<v Speaker 3>you've got the same document being used </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a source for pro choice and pro life </v>

924
00:41:31.151 --> 00:41:31.984
<v Speaker 3>people or pro gun laws and gun </v>
<v Speaker 3>restriction people using the very same </v>

925
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:36.524
<v Speaker 3>document to make their arguments because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dispute is over what that document </v>

926
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:40.970
<v Speaker 3>means in this day and age in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

927
00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:42.323
<v Speaker 3>And so you don't really need to believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the scripture to concede that there </v>

928
00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:46.970
<v Speaker 3>is no one definitive reading of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shakespeare.</v>

929
00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:47.804
<v Speaker 3>There's no one definitive reading of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible and there's no one definitive </v>

930
00:41:49.911 --> 00:41:50.744
<v Speaker 3>reading of the Koran.</v>

931
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

932
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.930
<v Speaker 2>So one more piece on this portion of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

933
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.210
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of the term </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia?</v>

934
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:57.303
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because to me the term itself has a lot </v>

935
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:01.694
<v Speaker 2>of problems with it because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think people fear Islam as in the </v>

936
00:42:05.091 --> 00:42:07.310
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fear if there,</v>

937
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 2>if there is a fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some people it's the actions.</v>

938
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:14.000
<v Speaker 2>They fear the actions that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking in the name of the religion,</v>

939
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:14.834
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I know that can be confusing for </v>

940
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 2>people because that's the idea verse the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

941
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:22.070
<v Speaker 2>but I do see this meme of calling </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone in Islamophobia and it goes,</v>

942
00:42:22.071 --> 00:42:24.290
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a lot of things we've talked about so</v>

943
00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:25.470
<v Speaker 2>far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I fear that,</v>

944
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:30.170
<v Speaker 2>that their use of that word also is </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating a real,</v>

945
00:42:30.171 --> 00:42:31.004
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real backlash to what they want to </v>

946
00:42:32.991 --> 00:42:33.824
<v Speaker 2>accomplish.</v>

947
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sea,</v>

948
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:37.030
<v Speaker 3>often this word is deployed to silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

949
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:37.873
<v Speaker 3>it's used to kind of muzzle the debate </v>
<v Speaker 3>when people have every right to </v>

950
00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:46.240
<v Speaker 3>criticize and scrutinize and satirize </v>
<v Speaker 3>any idea whether it's Christianity,</v>

951
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.940
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's religion,</v>

952
00:42:48.941 --> 00:42:51.040
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any idea,</v>

953
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is open to scrutiny in the patent.</v>

954
00:42:53.101 --> 00:42:53.970
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

955
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.833
<v Speaker 3>the essence of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how all societies have ended up </v>

956
00:42:56.651 --> 00:42:58.090
<v Speaker 3>where they are today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

957
00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.460
<v Speaker 3>every innovator for their day was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>blast.</v>

958
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:01.303
<v Speaker 3>Fema,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Galileo questioned things that he was </v>

959
00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:08.710
<v Speaker 3>called a heretic for what's considered a</v>
<v Speaker 3>heretic for theory of evolution.</v>

960
00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

961
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:10.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even profits were heritage acts </v>

962
00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.250
<v Speaker 3>against the old religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

963
00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether that's Mohammed,</v>

964
00:43:16.181 --> 00:43:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moses,</v>

965
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:20.110
<v Speaker 3>so at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't for blast for me,</v>

966
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.550
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

967
00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.220
<v Speaker 3>questioning established norms and </v>
<v Speaker 3>heresy,</v>

968
00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:27.520
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to use the word Islamophobia,</v>

969
00:43:27.521 --> 00:43:28.354
<v Speaker 3>to silence any scrutiny of an idea would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be to hinder this debate and the </v>

970
00:43:32.681 --> 00:43:34.300
<v Speaker 3>progress that is needed in this debate.</v>

971
00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.373
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the term for that reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's deployed to often </v>

972
00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.630
<v Speaker 3>against people who are simply </v>
<v Speaker 3>questioning whether the,</v>

973
00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.780
<v Speaker 3>whether Islam needs to be reformed or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

974
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:46.660
<v Speaker 3>or whether Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam has a relationship to Islam,</v>

975
00:43:46.661 --> 00:43:48.460
<v Speaker 3>which of course it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

976
00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam is an offshoot of Islam.</v>

977
00:43:50.021 --> 00:43:50.854
<v Speaker 3>It's wrong to say it's got nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Islam and so people don't have in </v>

978
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.980
<v Speaker 3>asking these questions to deal with some</v>
<v Speaker 3>very real problems in the world.</v>

979
00:43:56.981 --> 00:43:59.080
<v Speaker 3>I've been called Islamophobes and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually unfair.</v>

980
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:03.130
<v Speaker 3>I prefer the word anti Muslim bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is such a thing as our anti Muslim</v>

981
00:44:03.131 --> 00:44:07.270
<v Speaker 3>bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people who like Carson,</v>

982
00:44:07.271 --> 00:44:11.020
<v Speaker 3>who don't believe in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in perhaps don't believe in evolution,</v>

983
00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.480
<v Speaker 3>but they also don't want Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>presidents of the United States.</v>

984
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with a neuroscientist who</v>

985
00:44:15.121 --> 00:44:17.910
<v Speaker 2>doesn't believe in evolution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things don't seem like they should</v>

986
00:44:17.911 --> 00:44:18.350
<v Speaker 2>add up,</v>

987
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 3>but it kind of indicates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

988
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.270
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

989
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.250
<v Speaker 3>So there is something about people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>

990
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.213
<v Speaker 3>they want to discriminate against people</v>
<v Speaker 3>like me because of the religion I was </v>

991
00:44:25.671 --> 00:44:26.361
<v Speaker 3>born into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

992
00:44:26.361 --> 00:44:27.170
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

993
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:28.003
<v Speaker 3>that's anti Muslim bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's very different to </v>

994
00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.920
<v Speaker 3>scrutinizing the idea and that's why I </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed this maximum,</v>

995
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 3>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the dialogue with Sam and that isn't</v>

996
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:37.920
<v Speaker 3>no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

997
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.783
<v Speaker 3>should be or is ever above scrutiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No idea is above screws and even though </v>

998
00:44:41.641 --> 00:44:42.474
<v Speaker 3>people have been a dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that really nicely </v>

999
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 3>summarizes where we should stand on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate.</v>

1000
00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:47.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a great segue for my </v>

1001
00:44:48.621 --> 00:44:50.330
<v Speaker 2>next question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1002
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.433
<v Speaker 2>what has the reaction from just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream Muslim community in </v>

1003
00:44:56.091 --> 00:44:58.250
<v Speaker 2>England been to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when I,</v>

1004
00:44:58.251 --> 00:45:00.830
<v Speaker 2>even when I tweeted out that we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to sit down and do this,</v>

1005
00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.173
<v Speaker 2>the majority of it was positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously we have a certain amount </v>

1006
00:45:04.341 --> 00:45:05.174
<v Speaker 2>of people that follow both of us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what we think about things that </v>

1007
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.110
<v Speaker 2>enjoy what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's expected.</v>

1008
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.090
<v Speaker 2>But I did get some people that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1009
00:45:11.091 --> 00:45:11.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1010
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.820
<v Speaker 2>it was this porch monkey mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1011
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.840
<v Speaker 2>he's just doing this for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for money and affection of white people.</v>

1012
00:45:17.841 --> 00:45:20.630
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think is pure nonsense.</v>

1013
00:45:20.631 --> 00:45:21.464
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the mainstream Muslim </v>

1014
00:45:22.761 --> 00:45:23.960
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1015
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.130
<v Speaker 2>that you're around every day?</v>

1016
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:26.731
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1017
00:45:26.731 --> 00:45:29.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream Muslims on Islamists,</v>

1018
00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:29.913
<v Speaker 3>they are conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not Islamists and there's </v>

1019
00:45:31.491 --> 00:45:33.420
<v Speaker 3>certainly not jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1020
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.530
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1021
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:36.820
<v Speaker 3>while they're not going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they disagreed with me,</v>

1022
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:37.990
<v Speaker 3>is they're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1023
00:45:37.991 --> 00:45:41.280
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to basically attack me</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it or,</v>

1024
00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.130
<v Speaker 3>or launch into a tirade at home with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them even if they disagreed.</v>

1025
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:46.263
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very realistic about where I stand </v>

1026
00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.173
<v Speaker 3>among my own religious communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's because if I had just </v>

1027
00:45:52.511 --> 00:45:54.460
<v Speaker 3>restricted myself to challenging </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamism,</v>

1028
00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:58.030
<v Speaker 3>I probably would have had the support of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other welding majority,</v>

1029
00:45:58.031 --> 00:45:58.864
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream of Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other alarming mainstream also </v>

1030
00:46:02.081 --> 00:46:04.900
<v Speaker 3>happened to be in social and religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>matters,</v>

1031
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.823
<v Speaker 3>conservative with a small seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I challenged that to I call for </v>

1032
00:46:09.371 --> 00:46:12.700
<v Speaker 3>reform in our approach and </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of the scripture.</v>

1033
00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:15.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm a liberal socially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1034
00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.413
<v Speaker 3>as well as politically and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mentioned I'm a member of the </v>

1035
00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the centrist party there.</v>

1036
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1037
00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:23.793
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have very openly supported a lot of </v>

1038
00:46:26.711 --> 00:46:29.490
<v Speaker 3>social reform on these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that,</v>

1039
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:33.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have some acid Quilliam who advocated</v>

1040
00:46:33.281 --> 00:46:34.114
<v Speaker 3>for the reconciliation of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic create these granite creed that </v>

1041
00:46:37.541 --> 00:46:39.540
<v Speaker 3>was incredibly controversial when he did</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1042
00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:41.470
<v Speaker 3>he was kicked out of his mosque,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1043
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.470
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not an Islamic mosque,</v>

1044
00:46:43.471 --> 00:46:47.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a conservative mosque.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the reason that,</v>

1045
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:47.681
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1046
00:46:47.681 --> 00:46:48.514
<v Speaker 3>that you will sense a lot of backlash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because we take on the twin </v>

1047
00:46:51.911 --> 00:46:53.540
<v Speaker 3>challenges of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1048
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:54.543
<v Speaker 3>wanting to again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another sort of maximum is that what we </v>

1049
00:46:57.101 --> 00:46:59.890
<v Speaker 3>want to do is that Islam is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>must be intellectually terminated,</v>

1050
00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas Islam needs to be reformed.</v>

1051
00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.350
<v Speaker 3>But that's the twin challenge that faces</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1052
00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:08.920
<v Speaker 3>And it means that obviously because no </v>
<v Speaker 3>change is seamless,</v>

1053
00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:13.750
<v Speaker 3>all change is painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people get upset when they kind</v>

1054
00:47:13.751 --> 00:47:15.850
<v Speaker 3>of hear some of the things we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the nature of change.</v>

1055
00:47:15.851 --> 00:47:16.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1056
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.020
<v Speaker 3>that's how society has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1057
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.480
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1058
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.300
<v Speaker 3>it's normal.</v>

1059
00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you might be slightly hesitant to</v>

1060
00:47:21.131 --> 00:47:21.964
<v Speaker 2>talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but can I ask you just in terms of your </v>

1061
00:47:23.291 --> 00:47:25.590
<v Speaker 2>own personal safety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you are.</v>

1062
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.400
<v Speaker 2>You are threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>

1063
00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.640
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of the other people in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>from bill to Sam,</v>

1064
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:33.850
<v Speaker 2>too many others have a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>threats that they deal with from,</v>

1065
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:35.140
<v Speaker 2>from all fronts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1066
00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:36.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think from someone like Sam,</v>

1067
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:38.980
<v Speaker 2>it comes from people from radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians too.</v>

1068
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:39.814
<v Speaker 2>So I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to make this about </v>

1069
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Islam or Muslims particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1070
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:45.423
<v Speaker 2>but people I think need to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you put yourself at great risk to </v>

1071
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:50.710
<v Speaker 2>talk about the things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

1072
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:51.544
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1073
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to dwell on this,</v>

1074
00:47:53.671 --> 00:47:57.170
<v Speaker 3>but it's not exactly the safest </v>
<v Speaker 3>occupation in the world.</v>

1075
00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.433
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot going on in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in England politically right now in </v>

1076
00:48:00.871 --> 00:48:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Corbyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you mentioned earlier,</v>

1077
00:48:02.851 --> 00:48:03.684
<v Speaker 2>is now head of the Labor Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the general sense of the </v>

1078
00:48:05.911 --> 00:48:08.250
<v Speaker 2>political atmosphere in England right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

1079
00:48:08.251 --> 00:48:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Because in America we get very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very little.</v>

1080
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Even if I just flick on BBC for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

1081
00:48:12.901 --> 00:48:15.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very little of what's going on with,</v>

1082
00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.160
<v Speaker 2>with basically our biggest ally in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1083
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because we are facing </v>

1084
00:48:20.341 --> 00:48:21.174
<v Speaker 3>the inlaws on what's happening here with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the phenomenon of the rise of Donald </v>

1085
00:48:24.571 --> 00:48:25.404
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got Jeremy Corbyn who is populist </v>

1086
00:48:30.451 --> 00:48:31.284
<v Speaker 3>in the way that trump is on the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>wing of politics and it's the same </v>

1087
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:36.383
<v Speaker 3>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually that's why you have the </v>

1088
00:48:37.621 --> 00:48:41.950
<v Speaker 3>horse horseshoe theory of politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that actually ultimately you're</v>

1089
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.833
<v Speaker 3>left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They come and they end up when they go </v>

1090
00:48:44.281 --> 00:48:46.020
<v Speaker 3>to the extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that meeting in the middle anyway.</v>

1091
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mussolini's Fascist,</v>

1092
00:48:48.151 --> 00:48:50.490
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not calling a fascist by any </v>
<v Speaker 3>means,</v>

1093
00:48:50.491 --> 00:48:51.324
<v Speaker 3>but mostly in his fascism was a left </v>
<v Speaker 3>wing phenomenon that emerged into </v>

1094
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:57.090
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they ended up meeting.</v>

1095
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.880
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you look at corbion and trump,</v>

1096
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:03.750
<v Speaker 3>what they both have in common is they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>antiestablishment approach.</v>

1097
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a total disdain for politics and</v>

1098
00:49:07.321 --> 00:49:08.670
<v Speaker 3>the way that things have been going on?</v>

1099
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1100
00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:12.600
<v Speaker 3>they want to change the status quo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that playing on popular anger,</v>

1101
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.120
<v Speaker 3>which in many instances is there for </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimate reasons.</v>

1102
00:49:15.121 --> 00:49:17.610
<v Speaker 3>But in other instances it's playing up </v>
<v Speaker 3>the identity politics.</v>

1103
00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.610
<v Speaker 3>They identify the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in trump's case,</v>

1104
00:49:20.611 --> 00:49:24.330
<v Speaker 3>the Mexicans and the wall that the city </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of building a wall that he wants,</v>

1105
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identifying the other and allying with </v>

1106
00:49:27.001 --> 00:49:31.260
<v Speaker 3>some unsavory people to achieve that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all part of the parcel of,</v>

1107
00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.453
<v Speaker 3>of the politics of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our times and across Europe were </v>

1108
00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:39.450
<v Speaker 3>witnessing this phenomenon with the rise</v>
<v Speaker 3>of far right populist parties.</v>

1109
00:49:39.451 --> 00:49:42.810
<v Speaker 3>And in Greece we had golden dawn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we got series series a,</v>

1110
00:49:42.811 --> 00:49:45.590
<v Speaker 3>which is a far left populist party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1111
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:46.463
<v Speaker 3>in Scotland we had the Scottish </v>
<v Speaker 3>nationalists who wanted to break away </v>

1112
00:49:48.631 --> 00:49:51.060
<v Speaker 3>from the United Kingdom and the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>for them where the English.</v>

1113
00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.290
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1114
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.403
<v Speaker 3>because for whatever reason people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling particularly vulnerable and </v>

1115
00:49:56.581 --> 00:49:57.414
<v Speaker 3>insecure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are rallying around identity </v>

1116
00:49:59.101 --> 00:50:01.650
<v Speaker 3>politics and defining themselves against</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody else.</v>

1117
00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:04.800
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very unhelpful,</v>

1118
00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.610
<v Speaker 3>unhealthy way to engage in politics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it leads to more division,</v>

1119
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.410
<v Speaker 3>which is what we see playing out across </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

1120
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only do we see it playing out across</v>

1121
00:50:12.141 --> 00:50:12.971
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you know,</v>

1122
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:13.804
<v Speaker 2>we have this massive refugee crisis </v>
<v Speaker 2>which you guys in Europe or are having </v>

1123
00:50:16.641 --> 00:50:19.970
<v Speaker 2>to deal with much more than we are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the states now.</v>

1124
00:50:19.971 --> 00:50:20.804
<v Speaker 2>Europe already has a huge problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrating their immigrants as a </v>

1125
00:50:24.261 --> 00:50:27.080
<v Speaker 2>general rule a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in Muslim.</v>

1126
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

1127
00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.333
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of what England or what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the EU should be doing or </v>

1128
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:35.930
<v Speaker 2>can be doing with the refugee situation?</v>

1129
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.820
<v Speaker 3>I think the important thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>integration.</v>

1130
00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:44.080
<v Speaker 3>I would caution people and they will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the United Kingdom.</v>

1131
00:50:44.081 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 3>We are overdue isis attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not if,</v>

1132
00:50:47.271 --> 00:50:51.940
<v Speaker 3>but when Isis chooses and decides it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of striking in the UK,</v>

1133
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:54.970
<v Speaker 3>I would urge people not to blame the </v>
<v Speaker 3>refugees.</v>

1134
00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.520
<v Speaker 3>These are people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1135
00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:58.383
<v Speaker 3>in some cases who have fought isis in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Syria and Iraq and then a flat since </v>

1136
00:51:01.781 --> 00:51:02.614
<v Speaker 3>then or in other cases were fleeing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives because they disagree with </v>

1137
00:51:05.831 --> 00:51:10.360
<v Speaker 3>everything that Isis is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course among them there may be one or</v>

1138
00:51:10.361 --> 00:51:11.194
<v Speaker 3>two fighters and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's neither here nor there </v>

1139
00:51:13.941 --> 00:51:18.310
<v Speaker 3>because 1000 born and raised British </v>
<v Speaker 3>citizens of concert joined isis anyway.</v>

1140
00:51:18.311 --> 00:51:19.300
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1141
00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:22.540
<v Speaker 3>they're finding it easy enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>recruit from UK born citizens,</v>

1142
00:51:22.541 --> 00:51:24.460
<v Speaker 3>let alone having to sneak them in with </v>
<v Speaker 3>refugees.</v>

1143
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:25.503
<v Speaker 3>So if there are attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would urge people not to blame these </v>

1144
00:51:27.161 --> 00:51:29.440
<v Speaker 3>poor desperate refugees who need our </v>
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>

1145
00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.273
<v Speaker 3>And our sympathy and our understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what I would consider what I would </v>

1146
00:51:33.521 --> 00:51:34.930
<v Speaker 3>say is important to consider for </v>
<v Speaker 3>governments.</v>

1147
00:51:34.931 --> 00:51:36.640
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not to repeat the,</v>

1148
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:38.303
<v Speaker 3>is when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you mentioned integration wasn't </v>

1149
00:51:41.561 --> 00:51:42.394
<v Speaker 3>seen as important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what we ended up developing in </v>

1150
00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:48.910
<v Speaker 3>Europe and in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can speak to what he's self segregated</v>

1151
00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.400
<v Speaker 3>communities that didn't mix with one </v>
<v Speaker 3>another and they,</v>

1152
00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:53.283
<v Speaker 3>they grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1153
00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.153
<v Speaker 3>it's possible in 2015 to be born and </v>
<v Speaker 3>raised in London as a Muslim teenager </v>

1154
00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:01.420
<v Speaker 3>and not have a single mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim friend,</v>

1155
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:03.610
<v Speaker 3>nor a single friend from the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>

1156
00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.780
<v Speaker 3>And I just think that's not a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological state to be in.</v>

1157
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.700
<v Speaker 3>So I would encourage governments to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1158
00:52:09.701 --> 00:52:11.770
<v Speaker 3>really robust and strong integration </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies.</v>

1159
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1160
00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.840
<v Speaker 2>do you think that that's even possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're already dealing with the</v>

1161
00:52:16.841 --> 00:52:20.260
<v Speaker 2>integration problem that exists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that the conversation has</v>

1162
00:52:20.261 --> 00:52:22.690
<v Speaker 2>been dumbed down to the point where if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say anything,</v>

1163
00:52:22.691 --> 00:52:25.420
<v Speaker 2>if you were to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we shouldn't bring in more refugees</v>

1164
00:52:25.421 --> 00:52:28.390
<v Speaker 2>right now that people would immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>call you racist,</v>

1165
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.660
<v Speaker 2>which the truth probably is somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>

1166
00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:32.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's obviously a certain amount of </v>

1167
00:52:32.981 --> 00:52:34.870
<v Speaker 2>people that are going to be xenophobic </v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what.</v>

1168
00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:37.840
<v Speaker 2>And then there are also some legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerns about what the,</v>

1169
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:41.350
<v Speaker 2>what this can do to societies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we so rarely have this conversation,</v>

1170
00:52:41.351 --> 00:52:42.184
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1171
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:43.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

1172
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:45.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day I'm,</v>

1173
00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:46.803
<v Speaker 3>the immigration conversation is a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Islam isn't conversation then </v>

1174
00:52:49.361 --> 00:52:52.480
<v Speaker 3>it's immediately shot down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>accusations of bigotry.</v>

1175
00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:53.950
<v Speaker 3>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1176
00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.930
<v Speaker 3>a lead costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>

1177
00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.970
<v Speaker 3>of those who want to shut that </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation down.</v>

1178
00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.293
<v Speaker 3>It is important that these conversations</v>
<v Speaker 3>are in fact thrown open in the recent </v>

1179
00:53:03.431 --> 00:53:04.264
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the political history of the United </v>

1180
00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.333
<v Speaker 3>Kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen the consequences of not </v>

1181
00:53:06.941 --> 00:53:11.050
<v Speaker 3>having these conversations because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>these debates were shut down by the,</v>

1182
00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:11.450
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1183
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:15.520
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream parties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened as a result is the rise of</v>

1184
00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.653
<v Speaker 3>a two groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is street protest movement and the </v>

1185
00:53:19.001 --> 00:53:19.834
<v Speaker 3>other political party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ukip United Kingdom Independence </v>

1186
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.360
<v Speaker 3>Party that wants to break away from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>union and monster and all immigration.</v>

1187
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.710
<v Speaker 3>That party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1188
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:29.603
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which started taking a chunk out of a </v>

1189
00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 3>conservative support base arose at </v>
<v Speaker 3>lightening speed in the UK.</v>

1190
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:36.990
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by Nigel farage,</v>

1191
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:38.003
<v Speaker 3>precisely because the main political </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties didn't want to talk about </v>

1192
00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:41.604
<v Speaker 3>racism.</v>

1193
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:42.390
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1194
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:43.223
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an uglier version of that conversation </v>

1195
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.630
<v Speaker 3>happened on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the fringes of the mainstream because</v>

1196
00:53:48.631 --> 00:53:49.464
<v Speaker 3>we didn't want to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that happened was </v>

1197
00:53:51.391 --> 00:53:53.490
<v Speaker 3>the rise of the English Defense League,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the EDL.</v>

1198
00:53:53.491 --> 00:53:54.270
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1199
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.670
<v Speaker 3>what have been Europe's largest street </v>
<v Speaker 3>protest movement.</v>

1200
00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:57.973
<v Speaker 3>I began organizing rallies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrations up and down the country </v>

1201
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.750
<v Speaker 3>because conversation about Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>

1202
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.860
<v Speaker 3>So what I advocate and the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so a,</v>

1203
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:08.703
<v Speaker 3>so a so heavily for having these </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations is we don't have them in </v>

1204
00:54:12.841 --> 00:54:14.940
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream in a responsible way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fringes,</v>

1205
00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:15.774
<v Speaker 3>we'll have them in an irresponsible way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the danger of the voldemort </v>

1206
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:19.783
<v Speaker 3>effect that I refer to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's very much what I'm trying to </v>

1207
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:22.464
<v Speaker 3>do with this show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I'm going to have people </v>

1208
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:26.970
<v Speaker 3>from all over the political spectrum </v>
<v Speaker 3>here because we need,</v>

1209
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:27.930
<v Speaker 3>we need these conversations.</v>

1210
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.520
<v Speaker 3>So just one more thing on the refugee </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1211
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:30.563
<v Speaker 3>What do you make of the Arab countries </v>
<v Speaker 3>that basically aren't taking in their </v>

1212
00:54:34.711 --> 00:54:35.790
<v Speaker 3>brothers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1213
00:54:35.791 --> 00:54:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I think Saudi Arabia has led in maybe 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>families or something.</v>

1214
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:39.923
<v Speaker 3>All these countries we're seeing Egypt's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not letting anyone in Turkey has done a </v>

1215
00:54:42.361 --> 00:54:43.194
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey's not in our country but all but </v>

1216
00:54:44.161 --> 00:54:45.630
<v Speaker 3>all of these countries that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1217
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:48.000
<v Speaker 3>What do you make of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1218
00:54:48.001 --> 00:54:48.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1219
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:49.543
<v Speaker 3>to we have a caveat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the Gulf Arab countries that had </v>

1220
00:54:51.851 --> 00:54:55.860
<v Speaker 3>let in zero refugees whereas Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lebanon,</v>

1221
00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:56.731
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1222
00:54:56.731 --> 00:54:57.564
<v Speaker 3>and these surrounding countries that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't Gulf Arabs have millions of </v>

1223
00:55:00.841 --> 00:55:01.674
<v Speaker 3>refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there is that distinction to be </v>

1224
00:55:03.031 --> 00:55:05.200
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan is overflowing with refugee camps</v>

1225
00:55:05.201 --> 00:55:08.220
<v Speaker 3>and tents and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the Gulf Arabs,</v>

1226
00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:08.941
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1227
00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:10.740
<v Speaker 3>the Emirates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>

1228
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:12.450
<v Speaker 3>these countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kuwait,</v>

1229
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.680
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1230
00:55:13.681 --> 00:55:14.431
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1231
00:55:14.431 --> 00:55:17.820
<v Speaker 3>they think that actually they think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>their responsibilities,</v>

1232
00:55:17.821 --> 00:55:22.590
<v Speaker 3>I've been met simply by providing funds </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the refugee camps.</v>

1233
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.590
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting point there too,</v>

1234
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.670
<v Speaker 3>to look at it as to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1235
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:30.180
<v Speaker 3>just with like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as with the Syria conflict,</v>

1236
00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:31.763
<v Speaker 3>there are certain responsibilities that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the regional powers have to deal with </v>

1237
00:55:34.711 --> 00:55:37.410
<v Speaker 3>conflict in their own back gardens and </v>
<v Speaker 3>in their own region.</v>

1238
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:39.840
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately that hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

1239
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.153
<v Speaker 3>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we complain when the international </v>

1240
00:55:44.131 --> 00:55:44.964
<v Speaker 3>community led by the United States of </v>
<v Speaker 3>America intervenes and you're on the </v>

1241
00:55:48.451 --> 00:55:51.330
<v Speaker 3>other hand when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when no intervention is forthcoming,</v>

1242
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.433
<v Speaker 3>we complain because we're saying that no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one cares about all the women and </v>

1243
00:55:54.781 --> 00:55:57.600
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent men who are dying.</v>

1244
00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:00.690
<v Speaker 3>And actually the only way around this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>

1245
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:01.524
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't want international </v>

1246
00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:02.994
<v Speaker 3>intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then take responsibility for your own </v>

1247
00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:06.630
<v Speaker 3>region and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and intervene yourselves.</v>

1248
00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.673
<v Speaker 3>And that applies to refugees and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>applies to the war in Syria and dealing </v>

1249
00:56:10.561 --> 00:56:13.380
<v Speaker 3>with that through political and </v>
<v Speaker 3>diplomatic and military needs.</v>

1250
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.161
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1251
00:56:14.161 --> 00:56:15.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very critical.</v>

1252
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:16.164
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately I don't think these Gulf </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries have been doing even nearly </v>

1253
00:56:18.901 --> 00:56:20.490
<v Speaker 3>enough regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

1254
00:56:20.491 --> 00:56:21.324
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to just blame the Gulf </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries or any of the Arab states </v>

1255
00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>because we</v>

1256
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.560
<v Speaker 2>just saw at the UN in these last couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of days,</v>

1257
00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:27.394
<v Speaker 2>there seems to be now be this new </v>
<v Speaker 2>alliance between Iraq and Iran and </v>

1258
00:56:30.251 --> 00:56:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1259
00:56:31.451 --> 00:56:33.760
<v Speaker 2>as to what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more the US pulls out,</v>

1260
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 2>it seems as though the worse it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every time we go in,</v>

1261
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:37.260
<v Speaker 2>we seem to make it worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1262
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.430
<v Speaker 2>so there are no easy answers here I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is the,</v>

1263
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.300
<v Speaker 2>is the ultimate conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1264
00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.173
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one more thing for you because </v>

1265
00:56:43.241 --> 00:56:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to end all my </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews on,</v>

1266
00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:45.723
<v Speaker 2>on some sort of feeling of hope and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually you've done a nice job of </v>

1267
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:50.410
<v Speaker 2>giving us some hope that this whole way </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

1268
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.633
<v Speaker 2>But I really sensed that there has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last couple of months a real </v>

1269
00:56:56.171 --> 00:56:58.600
<v Speaker 2>secular awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sense it in,</v>

1270
00:56:58.601 --> 00:57:00.760
<v Speaker 2>in the response I'm getting to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>

1271
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:03.130
<v Speaker 2>the facebook messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are sending me emails,</v>

1272
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:05.530
<v Speaker 2>the tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing that people that secular</v>

1273
00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:10.531
<v Speaker 2>people that want to base their values on</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanism and not on,</v>

1274
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:11.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>magical sky gods and all of that stuff </v>

1275
00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:15.620
<v Speaker 2>that they're really waking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1276
00:57:15.621 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I think you've had a part to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Sam,</v>

1277
00:57:17.441 --> 00:57:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I think many other people do you sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that too?</v>

1278
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Please tell me you do or I'm in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>

1279
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:23.543
<v Speaker 3>I said it's particularly that more </v>
<v Speaker 3>voices that I call them minorities </v>

1280
00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:28.774
<v Speaker 3>within the minority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the left that we've spoken </v>

1281
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:33.070
<v Speaker 3>about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They traditional care about the minority</v>

1282
00:57:33.071 --> 00:57:33.904
<v Speaker 3>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually I'd say to them that if </v>

1283
00:57:35.291 --> 00:57:37.780
<v Speaker 3>they really worth their salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they really want to test their metal,</v>

1284
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:38.943
<v Speaker 3>what they should be caring about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other minorities within those minority </v>

1285
00:57:41.351 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 3>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gay Muslims,</v>

1286
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:44.650
<v Speaker 3>the lesbian Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Muslims,</v>

1287
00:57:44.651 --> 00:57:45.291
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1288
00:57:45.291 --> 00:57:49.360
<v Speaker 3>the liberal Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Muslims and the minorities such as the</v>

1289
00:57:49.361 --> 00:57:50.194
<v Speaker 3>Christians in Egypt of the CDS in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those minorities within minority </v>

1290
00:57:54.821 --> 00:57:57.190
<v Speaker 3>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I since have been rallying and waking up</v>

1291
00:57:57.191 --> 00:57:58.024
<v Speaker 3>and galvanizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I sense more and more Muslim </v>

1292
00:58:01.181 --> 00:58:03.700
<v Speaker 3>voices coming out to speak against not </v>
<v Speaker 3>just Islam,</v>

1293
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:04.543
<v Speaker 3>Islam from also a Islamic religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatism and we get messages every </v>

1294
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.873
<v Speaker 3>single day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get people asking to join our </v>

1295
00:58:10.421 --> 00:58:11.254
<v Speaker 3>organization to help us to work with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's really fantastic </v>

1296
00:58:14.951 --> 00:58:19.840
<v Speaker 3>because if we're going to really defeat </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the scourge of theocratic fascism and</v>

1297
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:23.740
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to help reform the way in</v>
<v Speaker 3>which Islam is interpreted the today and</v>

1298
00:58:23.741 --> 00:58:26.440
<v Speaker 3>those voices are really the crucial </v>
<v Speaker 3>voices that we need to hear from.</v>

1299
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you've been a huge part of that.</v>
