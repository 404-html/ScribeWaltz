00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I think you know exactly when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so before I even let you say anything </v>

15
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>we're throwing to the clip.</v>

16
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 2>We only take care of freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>preserve it to the next generation,</v>

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 2>and I am doing my part as an American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a brave American and the home of the </v>

18
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:05.731
<v Speaker 2>brave to make sure I follow in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>footsteps of our founding fathers and do</v>

19
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 2>my part as they entrusted me with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>which they have created.</v>

20
00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I feel it is my duty to make sure to </v>
<v Speaker 2>preserve it,</v>

21
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:19.291
<v Speaker 2>to pass it to my children and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>American children and many generations </v>

22
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 2>to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we fight.</v>

23
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 2>And I am so fortunate that through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 2>and it is a fight for freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for liberty,</v>

25
00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 2>for democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for security,</v>

26
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 2>for human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am privileged to meet the most amazing</v>

27
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:35.110
<v Speaker 2>people that I would never otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet,</v>

28
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.260
<v Speaker 2>like sitting here with you today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 2>and meet friends that have become </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifelong friends,</v>

30
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 2>literally like family to me that I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>never have otherwise met if it wasn't </v>

31
00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker 2>doing for what I do.</v>

32
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 2>So do I get depressed doing what I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking about terrorism and national </v>

33
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 2>security?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I do.</v>

34
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everybody.</v>

35
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'm completely depressed over </v>

36
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.271
<v Speaker 2>things that are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I hurt deeply by people who </v>

37
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:06.421
<v Speaker 2>stabbed me in the back or say bad things</v>
<v Speaker 2>about me or even reading my wikipedia </v>

38
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.601
<v Speaker 2>profile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what keeps me so energized is the </v>

39
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 2>American people and the American spirit </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing that we are making a difference.</v>

40
00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 2>We are growing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are changing our country,</v>

41
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 2>we are fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a purpose.</v>

42
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.010
<v Speaker 2>So when you and I die on our deathbed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can look back and we can say,</v>

43
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I made a difference as we take our last </v>
<v Speaker 2>breath and that's enough for me.</v>

44
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>That is how you end an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's it right there.</v>

45
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like your opus right there.</v>

46
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I spoke from the heart and when </v>

47
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.991
<v Speaker 2>you speak from the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your message resonates with people and </v>

48
00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:44.831
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly why people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a you and me are having such traction </v>

49
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:48.821
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are saying we love what </v>

50
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:51.761
<v Speaker 2>you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about time that somebody will say </v>

51
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:54.491
<v Speaker 2>the things that you are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our message is resonating and you know </v>

52
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 2>why people want something genuine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can tell,</v>

53
00:02:55.971 --> 00:03:00.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always tell my children the one thing </v>

54
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.341
<v Speaker 2>you can never love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can never fight club because people </v>

55
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:07.231
<v Speaker 2>can tell when you're genuine and in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that we live in today where </v>

56
00:03:07.231 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>everything is fake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is about social media and how</v>

57
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:11.130
<v Speaker 2>things appear before the camera and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

<v Speaker 2>be your friend because I'm going to get </v>

59
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.171
<v Speaker 2>something out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people look you and I put our life </v>

60
00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>on the line because of the conviction </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have about the truth that we are</v>

61
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:26.821
<v Speaker 2>speaking and why we are willing to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>great extent to just fight for that </v>

62
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It resonates with people.</v>

63
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.730
<v Speaker 2>So I go to wait to be with you today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is great.</v>

65
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.590
<v Speaker 1>did you always have this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>passion?</v>

66
00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were on last time we told her,</v>

67
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:44.601
<v Speaker 1>you told your whole life story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely fascinating and if </v>

68
00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:47.931
<v Speaker 1>you want to give me a just like a two </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute recap and we'll link to it down </v>

69
00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:47.940
<v Speaker 1>below so people can watch the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing if they haven't.</v>

70
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.740
<v Speaker 1>So if you wanna give me a little recap </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that,</v>

71
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.080
<v Speaker 1>but I also want to know where your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

72
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.790
<v Speaker 1>that smile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that joy,</v>

73
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:56.370
<v Speaker 1>that presence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does that come from within you and</v>

74
00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:57.360
<v Speaker 1>did you always have that?</v>

75
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I love life and I am so passionate about</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is because I lived from the age of </v>

76
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:09.420
<v Speaker 2>10 till the age of 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting to die every single day.</v>

77
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>So every single day in my formula,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years when I opened my eyes and I </v>

78
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:20.031
<v Speaker 2>saw sunshine outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know if I'm gonna live to see </v>

79
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.440
<v Speaker 2>the sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So living in a bomb shelter,</v>

80
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people ask me where the specimen comes </v>

81
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.181
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My nine slash 11 happened to me in 1975 </v>

82
00:04:29.181 --> 00:04:30.570
<v Speaker 2>when radical Islam is to blow up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

83
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.000
<v Speaker 2>bringing it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring me under the rubble,</v>

84
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:38.001
<v Speaker 2>wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up in a hospital for two and a </v>

85
00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 2>half months and later when I came back </v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

86
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.020
<v Speaker 2>my home was no longer the home I left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up living in this bomb shelter,</v>

87
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:46.200
<v Speaker 2>eight by 10 room underground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no electricity,</v>

88
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.450
<v Speaker 2>no water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and very little food.</v>

89
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's where I lived for seven years</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my life,</v>

90
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 2>robbed of my youth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely interacting with people,</v>

91
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.500
<v Speaker 2>barely interacting with people my age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived with my parents who were an </v>

92
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 2>elderly couple and that bomb shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all this,</v>

93
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

94
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.810

<v Speaker 2>Now I tell people I'm making up for lost</v>

95
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I love life.</v>

96
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I am so grateful for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so grateful for the people I meet,</v>

97
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.190
<v Speaker 2>the places I go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought I'd live the day beyond </v>

98
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.101
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I never thought I'd live with </v>

99
00:05:22.101 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 2>day beyond 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's loving life.</v>

100

<v Speaker 1>sit down and your whole story about </v>

<v Speaker 1>And all that.</v>

117
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:10.091
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm really past that part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I just want to do what I think is </v>

118
00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:13.211
<v Speaker 1>right and I want to sit down with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people like you and have those </v>

119
00:06:13.211 --> 00:06:13.211
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

120
00:06:13.211 --> 00:06:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but are you shocked at the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushback you get for defending the west </v>

121
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>and defending Judeo Christian values?</v>

122
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I am no longer shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the beginning.</v>

123
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.590
<v Speaker 2>I was very hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very disappointed.</v>

124
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 2>I thought my message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course the west is going to resonate.</v>

125
00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:36.351
<v Speaker 2>It's going to resonate in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are going to appreciate why it's </v>

126
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:36.720
<v Speaker 2>important to fight for freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

127
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 2>I was born and raised in Lebanon in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>country where if you stand up against </v>

128
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.840
<v Speaker 2>the status quo and you speak against the</v>
<v Speaker 2>regime,</v>

129
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 2>you are killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come take you in the middle of the </v>

130
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed you.</v>

131
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.540
<v Speaker 2>You will disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll never hear from you again.</v>

132
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.180
<v Speaker 2>I still have friends who disappeared 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

133
00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Their parents don't even know if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are alive or dead.</v>

134
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Journalist and my country of birth in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lebanon get killed for writing the wrong</v>

135
00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:02.601
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I came to the West and when I </v>

136
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:04.761
<v Speaker 2>started speaking in defense of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedoms and our values and our way of </v>

137
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:07.320
<v Speaker 2>life and the American values of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

138
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up for the truth and speaking </v>

139
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.590
<v Speaker 2>the truth without having to be worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about somebody killing you,</v>

140
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I could not believe people will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will come against me like that.</v>

141
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.030
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't stand for something,</v>

142
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know</v>

143
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.400
<v Speaker 2>you have to stand up for what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

144
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Those are the people that make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference and usually people that make </v>

145
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 2>a difference in this world are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular.</v>

146
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.570
<v Speaker 2>The most hated people in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at Churchill.</v>

147
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.030
<v Speaker 2>when he was alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.470
<v Speaker 2>people hated him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought,</v>

150
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.730
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 2>look at them today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People call people call people that has </v>

152
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 2>spoken such words of wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people left at the Monday.</v>

153
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.610
<v Speaker 2>We're saying them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so here we are today.</v>

154
00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:52.611
<v Speaker 2>We stand up and we fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't matter what people say </v>

155
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:55.581
<v Speaker 2>about me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it what I believe is right because </v>

156
00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I believe we are on a mission to save </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western civilization,</v>

157
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.750
<v Speaker 2>which is under attack right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm wanting to do my part to make it</v>

158
00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:01.170
<v Speaker 2>happen</v>

159
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>is part of the problem of the West now </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we don't have enough stories </v>

160
00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:11.010
<v Speaker 1>like yours because we've had it pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>good in the West for the last,</v>

161
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 some odd years.</v>

162
00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Certainly in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had a pretty good here,</v>

163
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.670
<v Speaker 1>so we've sort of gotten fat and lazy on </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

164
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:22.671
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what we're fighting for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what are the generations </v>

165
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:23.970
<v Speaker 1>before us lived through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lived through something,</v>

166
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:27.150
<v Speaker 1>so then you come here and then you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people that are slowly eroding</v>

167
00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:28.560
<v Speaker 1>their freedoms and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

168
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I know what this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where this leads.</v>

169
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My past is America's future.</v>

170
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Unless America wakes up today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see I am the end.</v>

171
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:43.581
<v Speaker 2>Frank who lived to tell about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if Anne Frank was alive </v>

172
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.920
<v Speaker 2>and the Nazis were spreading worldwide </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she just escaped the concentration </v>

173
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.331
<v Speaker 2>camps and she came to the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not csm was started rising in the </v>

174
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:57.440
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would be saying the same words that </v>

175
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 2>you when she was alive and well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my case.</v>

176
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 2>I started speaking after the attacks on </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 on the United States.</v>

177
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:06.831
<v Speaker 2>I started speaking about the threat of </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical Islam to world peace in our </v>

178
00:09:06.831 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 2>national security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because Americans had it so easy,</v>

179
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 2>they cannot fathom that some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>could hate us so much.</v>

180
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Even though radical Islamic terrorists </v>
<v Speaker 2>hijacked airplanes and use them as a </v>

181
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:22.101
<v Speaker 2>human missiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flying them into skyscrapers with the </v>

182
00:09:22.101 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 2>intention of killing not 3000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe 50,000</v>

183
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.160
<v Speaker 2>that worked in that building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

184
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 2>if they were late only 15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have killed tens of thousands</v>

185
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 2>of Americans.</v>

186
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so this is what I was talking about,</v>

187
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.540
<v Speaker 2>but Americans are such good people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who have never experienced the </v>

188
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.101
<v Speaker 2>type of terrorism that I lived under </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot relate and think that somebody </v>

189
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:48.111
<v Speaker 2>could be that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually that's the real intention </v>

190
00:09:48.111 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 2>to kill as many people as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you wake people up to that then?</v>

191
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because not everyone can have the lived </v>

192
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.041
<v Speaker 2>experience that you've had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to wake all the people </v>

193
00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to wake some of the people</v>

194
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:05.571
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to wake up the passionate </v>

195
00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:05.571
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 2>and my book rise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say two percent of the passionate will</v>

197
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:11.901
<v Speaker 2>always rule the 98 percent in different </v>
<v Speaker 2>and doesn't take money to change the </v>

198
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:16.461
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't percent of the passionate will </v>

199
00:10:16.461 --> 00:10:19.011
<v Speaker 2>always rule the 98 percent in different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just need to get people who are </v>

200
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:19.350
<v Speaker 2>fired up for your cause.</v>

201
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.470
<v Speaker 2>You need to get people who actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the problem and get the </v>

202
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.230
<v Speaker 2>problem and want to do something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change the world.</v>

203
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Those are the people you need to rally </v>
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>

204
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Those are the people who are gonna make </v>
<v Speaker 2>a difference in this world and those are</v>

205
00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 2>the people that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I try to communicate with.</v>

206
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 2>And because of that I was able to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>an organization,</v>

207
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:41.450
<v Speaker 2>act for America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud to tell you that we are now </v>

208
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 2>over 1 million members and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>

209
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 2>We have chapters nationwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have passed bills,</v>

210
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 2>$100 bills on the federal level as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the state level to protect America.</v>

211
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 2>So when people tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you worry about the names.</v>

212
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean people call you names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

213
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

214
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.800
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

215
00:10:57.801 --> 00:10:59.370
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will make you look bad.</v>

216
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:04.371
<v Speaker 2>They were on the list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The SLPC SPLC has called me and white </v>

217
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:04.890
<v Speaker 2>supremacy.</v>

218
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.350
<v Speaker 2>How do you like those white supremacists</v>
<v Speaker 2>clips and the white supremacists skin?</v>

219
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.650
<v Speaker 2>And this white supremacist hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

220
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.100
<v Speaker 2>but I tell people when people slap </v>
<v Speaker 2>labels on you,</v>

221
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 2>it's because they cannot argue with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>

222
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 2>That's why the only thing they can do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>call you names.</v>

223
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.080
<v Speaker 2>They cannot debate you on the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

224
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell people all the time,</v>

225
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.460
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about the labels and don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about the haters than New York </v>

226
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my last book,</v>

227
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:37.100
<v Speaker 2>they must be stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book came out in September of 2008 </v>

228
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.060
<v Speaker 2>that York Times interviewed me and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't find one quote and my article.</v>

229
00:11:42.031 --> 00:11:47.031
<v Speaker 2>So what did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They titled the Article Radical </v>

230
00:11:47.031 --> 00:11:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just an Islamophobe.</v>

231
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I am a radical Islamophobe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if I would have let that</v>

232
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 2>stop me because I was hurt that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like me.</v>

233
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 2>And that will be a radical Islamophobia </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of hiding under a table.</v>

234
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to kind of pat my emotions.</v>

235
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.200
<v Speaker 2>I went there and continue doing exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do best since 2008 till today.</v>

236
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 2>My organization has helped pass $100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bills.</v>

237
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:16.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let the naysayers and those to </v>

238
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:16.650
<v Speaker 2>slap labels on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop you,</v>

239
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.560
<v Speaker 2>keep on moving forward.</v>

240
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.490
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of these leftist </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations,</v>

241
00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:24.570
<v Speaker 1>whether it's SPLC or the ato or now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the media,</v>

242
00:12:24.571 --> 00:12:29.571
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times that are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>empowering the very ideologies that </v>

243
00:12:30.181 --> 00:12:32.520
<v Speaker 1>would love to take away all of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedoms.</v>

244
00:12:32.521 --> 00:12:33.420
<v Speaker 1>And in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

245
00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:38.421
<v Speaker 1>you've got this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the progressive's basically </v>

246
00:12:38.421 --> 00:12:40.320
<v Speaker 1>in bed with the Islamists and to me it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're just sort of willful idiots</v>

247
00:12:40.321 --> 00:12:42.410
<v Speaker 1>or there's probably some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>pejorative.</v>

248
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

249
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.920
<v Speaker 2>and my book cries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a whole chapter titled the </v>

250
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.471
<v Speaker 2>leftists Islamists Coalition Because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what we are seeing right </v>

251
00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:51.900
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coming together.</v>

252
00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:56.901
<v Speaker 2>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we are seeing two people that do not </v>

253
00:12:56.901 --> 00:13:00.981
<v Speaker 2>agree with anything that we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not believe in American </v>

254
00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:05.300
<v Speaker 2>exceptionalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do not believe that America shouldn't </v>

255
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:05.730
<v Speaker 2>have strong borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do not believe that we know that we need</v>

256
00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:07.580
<v Speaker 2>to have a national identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to.</v>

257
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>securing our border,</v>

258
00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:12.000
<v Speaker 2>meaning securing and protecting our </v>
<v Speaker 2>national identity.</v>

259
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.610
<v Speaker 2>They did not believe in borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do not believe in language.</v>

260
00:13:14.611 --> 00:13:17.460
<v Speaker 2>They want to bring America down to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the rest of the world.</v>

261
00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:19.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America is equaled was Venezuela.</v>

262
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:24.300
<v Speaker 2>No one is better than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All societies are created equal uni that</v>

263
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.960
<v Speaker 2>even though people are created equal in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the eyes of God,</v>

264
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.200
<v Speaker 2>societies are not created equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what we are seeing right now is </v>

265
00:13:33.571 --> 00:13:35.790
<v Speaker 2>leftist organizations working with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic.</v>

266
00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:38.330
<v Speaker 2>So you've got organizations like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hclu,</v>

267
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:43.370
<v Speaker 2>the southern poverty law center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planned parenthood a move on that or </v>

268
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:47.220
<v Speaker 2>working with people like Linda Sarsour </v>
<v Speaker 2>who is a devout Islamist,</v>

269
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.440
<v Speaker 2>a proponent of Sharia law and working </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people like her or with care </v>

270
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:57.570
<v Speaker 2>counsel on American Islamic Relations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The acl is basically the legal arm of </v>

271
00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.370
<v Speaker 2>the council on American Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Relations.</v>

272
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 1>So do you think they realize what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on here?</v>

273
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:06.931
<v Speaker 1>This is the part that I'm always sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't like impugning people's </v>

274
00:14:06.931 --> 00:14:06.931
<v Speaker 1>motives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

275
00:14:06.931 --> 00:14:11.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they realize that they're working </v>

276
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.530
<v Speaker 1>with people who once they have the power</v>
<v Speaker 1>will gladly cut them out?</v>

277
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

278
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:16.860
<v Speaker 2>They just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

279
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Because people that work for the ACL,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you people that work for a,</v>

280
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.640
<v Speaker 2>a different leftist organizations have </v>
<v Speaker 2>good hearts,</v>

281
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.910
<v Speaker 2>they love America and they cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that people couldn't be bad or </v>

282
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.050
<v Speaker 2>people couldn't use them for their end </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>

283
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I talk about the Muslim Brotherhood</v>

284
00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:41.211
<v Speaker 2>project and you and I have talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim Brotherhood project and our </v>

285
00:14:41.211 --> 00:14:43.761
<v Speaker 2>previous interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to go watch that interview </v>

286
00:14:43.761 --> 00:14:45.120
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody watching us right now,</v>

287
00:14:45.121 --> 00:14:47.040
<v Speaker 2>they need to go back and watch that </v>
<v Speaker 2>previous interview.</v>

288
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim Brotherhood wrote a plan and </v>

289
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.131
<v Speaker 2>100 year plan for radical Islam to </v>
<v Speaker 2>infiltrate and dominate the west and </v>

290
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 2>established a stomach government on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

291
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.600
<v Speaker 2>What makes the plan so unique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the plan for the United </v>

292
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:01.610
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the destruction of America.</v>

293
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.880
<v Speaker 2>The last page of the plan for America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's 29 front Islamic organizations set</v>

294
00:15:07.751 --> 00:15:12.751
<v Speaker 2>up in the United States with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific purpose of sabotage in America </v>

295
00:15:12.751 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 2>and destroying it from within.</v>

296
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Many of these organizations that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,</v>

297
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Isna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic Society of North America,</v>

298
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.900
<v Speaker 2>the MSA Muslim Students Association </v>
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>

299
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.080
<v Speaker 2>which started as iap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic Association for Palestine later </v>

300
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.731
<v Speaker 2>became care because they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create another name because the FBI was </v>

301
00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 2>on their tail knowing that they are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamas in the United States.</v>

302
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Those are the names mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we're seeing right now is people</v>

303
00:15:37.071 --> 00:15:42.071
<v Speaker 2>like the Hclu move on.org.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The southern poverty law center are </v>

304
00:15:42.071 --> 00:15:45.590
<v Speaker 2>basically used as the useful idiots at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands of an Islamist with an agenda.</v>

305
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:50.890
<v Speaker 2>So while I am very upset at how the Adl </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the SPLC or the acl EU is taking the </v>

306
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:58.280
<v Speaker 2>side of Islam as the against people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

307
00:15:58.281 --> 00:16:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what they say about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know they hate my guts.</v>

308
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I see that and it's sad to </v>

309
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.651
<v Speaker 2>realize that their good intentions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being used to do something better at the</v>

310
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't realize it at this point.</v>

311
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working with the Islam is </v>

312
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.750
<v Speaker 2>against people like me who basically are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to warn against the same people </v>

313
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.900
<v Speaker 2>are going to destroy them at the end and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why</v>

314
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:29.190
<v Speaker 1>the question that way because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like attacking people's motives and I </v>

315
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.460
<v Speaker 1>believed that if we were to sit down </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of the people at the Acl,</v>

316
00:16:30.461 --> 00:16:35.461
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the vast majority of them are </v>

317
00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:38.820
<v Speaker 1>totally doing all of these things for </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they believe to be the the right </v>

318
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.211
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet they've been just sort of </v>

319
00:16:42.211 --> 00:16:42.670
<v Speaker 1>tricked into having some really unholy </v>
<v Speaker 1>alliance.</v>

320
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the southern poverty law center,</v>

321
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

322
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.990
<v Speaker 2>They started as a good organization </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting the Klu Klux Klan doing </v>

323
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.260
<v Speaker 2>something good that was a result of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

324
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.440
<v Speaker 2>They raised money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found the Ku Klux Klan and the </v>

325
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.410
<v Speaker 2>client deserves to be in a whole because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we in America will never ever tolerate </v>

326
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 2>such true hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for them right now to slap the </v>

327
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.281
<v Speaker 2>label,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate on anybody speaks the truth or do </v>

328
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:13.490
<v Speaker 2>not agree with their point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What my heart is the.</v>

329
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.900
<v Speaker 2>I never judge anybody's heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the same way.</v>

330
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.140
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would ask me about a Barack </v>

331
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he's a Muslim?</v>

332
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.050
<v Speaker 2>You know I cannot judge anybody's heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who he prays for.</v>

333
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what's between him and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is God.</v>

334
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what he does and the privacy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his own home and I will never judge </v>

335
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.700
<v Speaker 2>where he stands and a lot of people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>

336
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.680
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even like me saying those </v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

337
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 2>but that's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will never judge what's in somebody's </v>

338
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.670
<v Speaker 2>heart or what's in somebody's mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I judged them by their actions.</v>

339
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.340
<v Speaker 2>So now when people slept labels on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

340
00:17:44.341 --> 00:17:46.950
<v Speaker 2>she's a hater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know me.</v>

341
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.410
<v Speaker 2>You have never even sat down with me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked me.</v>

342
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:54.530
<v Speaker 2>How can you slap a label and emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>label on somebody that you don't even </v>

343
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:54.530
<v Speaker 2>know</v>

344
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 1>if you're a hater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seriously much better actress </v>

345
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:58.480
<v Speaker 1>than hater because you got me fooled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady.</v>

346
00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.840
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you.</v>

347
00:17:59.841 --> 00:18:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

348
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:06.190
<v Speaker 2>sad to see that coming from them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not listening to whatever </v>

349
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.420
<v Speaker 2>explanation or even when we reach out to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

350
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.690
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to talk to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to hear our side of the,</v>

351
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.130
<v Speaker 2>of the view is like they judged us in </v>
<v Speaker 2>antia and that is that,</v>

352
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of judging and obscenity,</v>

353
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:19.670
<v Speaker 2>yet they are no better than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists in Lebanon.</v>

354
00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Israel this year and a visit </v>

355
00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.040
<v Speaker 2>with my parents' grave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not know if you know,</v>

356
00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:27.650
<v Speaker 2>my parents are bird with Oscar Schindler</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mount Zion.</v>

357
00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.680
<v Speaker 2>And so this was the first time.</v>

358
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Tell people how you ended up in Israel </v>
<v Speaker 1>after leaving Lebanon.</v>

359
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left Lebanon.</v>

360
00:18:34.731 --> 00:18:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I ended up moving to Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming these anchor for world news and</v>

361
00:18:37.731 --> 00:18:41.180
<v Speaker 2>working in Jerusalem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when my parents died,</v>

362
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.640
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to make sure that I burned them</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Israel because I wanted to make sure </v>

363
00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:50.930
<v Speaker 2>that my children yet unborn will always </v>
<v Speaker 2>know where my loyalty lies.</v>

364
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.910
<v Speaker 2>And because I'm a firm believer that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions speak louder than words.</v>

365
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.590
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to make sure I honor my </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents because I adore my parents.</v>

366
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.400
<v Speaker 2>This is a very sensitive subject with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

367
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an only child.</v>

368
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.460
<v Speaker 2>I worship my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live every single day of my life doing</v>

369
00:19:10.461 --> 00:19:13.910
<v Speaker 2>everything I do to honor them and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>legacy and you know,</v>

370
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.920
<v Speaker 2>speaking of hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some former employer did me wrong when I</v>

371
00:19:18.921 --> 00:19:23.921
<v Speaker 2>was 22 years old and I remember sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>on my father's lap and he's wheelchair </v>

372
00:19:23.921 --> 00:19:25.250
<v Speaker 2>hugging him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was crying and I said,</v>

373
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just hate them.</v>

374
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.540
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe they did this to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my father said to me,</v>

375
00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:30.890
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

376
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.620
<v Speaker 2>ever want to hear that word coming out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your mouth.</v>

377
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.800
<v Speaker 2>I never raised you to hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if for nothing else because of the </v>

378
00:19:39.171 --> 00:19:42.920
<v Speaker 2>way I adore my father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that day,</v>

379
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.640
<v Speaker 2>at 22 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I vowed I will never hate somebody.</v>

380
00:19:46.641 --> 00:19:49.670
<v Speaker 2>My father died like two weeks later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will never,</v>

381
00:19:49.671 --> 00:19:52.130
<v Speaker 2>ever allow hate to enter my heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards my enemies,</v>

382
00:19:52.131 --> 00:19:54.380
<v Speaker 2>towards anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate anybody.</v>

383
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.340
<v Speaker 2>So when my parents died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I buried them in Jerusalem.</v>

384
00:19:58.341 --> 00:20:00.590
<v Speaker 2>They are buried with Oscar Schindler and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mount Zion.</v>

385
00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.740
<v Speaker 2>We're actually later he was brought in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and buried next to them.</v>

386
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.580
<v Speaker 2>So this year I went back to Lebanon to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel,</v>

387
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.610
<v Speaker 2>and because I cannot go to Lebanon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hezbollah wants me dead.</v>

388
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.460
<v Speaker 2>So I go to Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I visited Israel,</v>

389
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:18.490
<v Speaker 2>I meet with the idea of I actually was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first Lebanese person to ever make </v>

390
00:20:19.191 --> 00:20:22.040
<v Speaker 2>it to the rooftop of the IDF </v>
<v Speaker 2>headquarters in Tel Aviv,</v>

391
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.460
<v Speaker 2>and I recorded videos with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spokesperson of the IDF and with the top</v>

392
00:20:25.461 --> 00:20:28.640
<v Speaker 2>generals were recorded videos to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast to the United Nations,</v>

393
00:20:28.641 --> 00:20:32.810
<v Speaker 2>to the international community video to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be broadcast to Lebanon about how,</v>

394
00:20:32.811 --> 00:20:35.330
<v Speaker 2>why we need to work together towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>peace,</v>

395
00:20:35.331 --> 00:20:36.770
<v Speaker 2>why we need to love each other.</v>

396
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Potato aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget what you're thought about the </v>

397
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.351
<v Speaker 2>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel doesn't want anything but peace </v>

398
00:20:44.351 --> 00:20:44.351
<v Speaker 2>with its neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's work together on peace.</v>

399
00:20:44.351 --> 00:20:49.000
<v Speaker 2>And for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hezbollah aired that on Lebanese </v>

400
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.771
<v Speaker 2>television they charged me with treason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I am wanted that in Lebanon and </v>

401
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:59.041
<v Speaker 2>sentenced to death by hanging in to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here we have a group of terrorists in</v>

402
00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:04.450
<v Speaker 2>my home country of Lebanon who judged me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who I am,</v>

403
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:09.451
<v Speaker 2>and I deserve to be sentenced to death </v>
<v Speaker 2>by hanging because they did not agree </v>

404
00:21:09.451 --> 00:21:12.370
<v Speaker 2>with me preaching a message of love </v>
<v Speaker 2>about being friends with the Jews.</v>

405
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.380
<v Speaker 2>So here we have them calling me haters </v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet I have the leftist in America,</v>

406
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:22.381
<v Speaker 2>the southern poverty law center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these people calling me haters </v>

407
00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:23.350
<v Speaker 2>simply because I'm warning about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic terrorist threat.</v>

408
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:28.390
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you've got too much good in you to </v>

409
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.981
<v Speaker 1>focus on the haters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do have one other question about </v>

410
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:29.981
<v Speaker 1>the haters and then we're gonna just put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it behind us,</v>

411
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 1>which is when marginalized sued the </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern poverty law center.</v>

412
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Now he's been removed from their anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim extremists list.</v>

413
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.140
<v Speaker 1>And you were on there still as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

414
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Is I on still on there?</v>

415
00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Actually that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

416
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still a over there.</v>

417
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding?</v>

418
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Linda Sarsour.</v>

419
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Once you're A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

420
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Well once my private parts removed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot women's feminist movement,</v>

421
00:21:54.771 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

422
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.430
<v Speaker 2>but that the world is turned upside </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

423
00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.790
<v Speaker 2>So we are still on that list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

424
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.400
<v Speaker 1>sitter or a lawsuit or anything because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not generally for lawsuits in these </v>

425
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.481
<v Speaker 1>cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it magic proved that if they've </v>

426
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:13.670
<v Speaker 1>really wronged you and you can get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backing to get the lawyers to do it,</v>

427
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.280
<v Speaker 1>that ultimately justice does prevail.</v>

428
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:22.100
<v Speaker 2>We talk to our attorneys to sue them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cost a lot of money and </v>

429
00:22:23.251 --> 00:22:28.251
<v Speaker 2>they can drag it for years and years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>years have gotten onto 90 attorneys on </v>

430
00:22:28.251 --> 00:22:28.251
<v Speaker 2>staff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

431
00:22:28.251 --> 00:22:30.510
<v Speaker 2>we have to depend on the generosity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attorneys to do with pro bono.</v>

432
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.230
<v Speaker 2>They get dragged out forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus because I'm a public person and the</v>

433
00:22:34.231 --> 00:22:38.070
<v Speaker 2>head of an organization that will get us</v>
<v Speaker 2>into discovery,</v>

434
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.240
<v Speaker 2>which means they not only can't subpoena</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

435
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.370
<v Speaker 2>which I don't say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not worried,</v>

436
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:49.670
<v Speaker 2>but they can go after my chapters and </v>
<v Speaker 2>any communications our chapters have </v>

437
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.391
<v Speaker 2>done with their friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now our chapters are completely </v>

438
00:22:53.391 --> 00:22:56.901
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their members are completely </v>

439
00:22:56.901 --> 00:22:56.901
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know who they are.</v>

440
00:22:56.901 --> 00:23:01.190
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody sent a personal email to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a third party mentioning any worried </v>

441
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.530
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

442
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.560
<v Speaker 2>which we are completely not responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for because they don't speak about </v>

443
00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:06.560
<v Speaker 2>headquarters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can say,</v>

444
00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.181
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we told you they've got people that </v>

445
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:11.181
<v Speaker 2>tight.</v>

446
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:11.940
<v Speaker 2>And so because I do not know three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four levels down,</v>

447
00:23:11.941 --> 00:23:16.290
<v Speaker 2>see Nash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have a national organization.</v>

448
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not was chapters and members </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the way we do.</v>

449
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.300
<v Speaker 2>So he's only responsible for what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says.</v>

450
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:26.450
<v Speaker 2>I can fight and defend what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I cannot fight and defend what </v>

451
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.480
<v Speaker 2>people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

452
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.910
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the SPLC went after us and they said,</v>

453
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.140
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got white supremacist.</v>

454
00:23:31.141 --> 00:23:35.130
<v Speaker 2>You know who show up to our rallies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Round is on the side street corner.</v>

455
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.720
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can stand on the side street </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner or you know the.</v>

456
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.100
<v Speaker 2>You cannot say that these members belong</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my organization,</v>

457
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 2>but they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the tactic of the left right </v>

458
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

459
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 1>let's focus on</v>

460
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.100
<v Speaker 2>the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the subtitle is in Defensive Judeo </v>

461
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Christian values and freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just most simply,</v>

462
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:56.330
<v Speaker 2>if someone said to you what our Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian values,</v>

463
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.550
<v Speaker 2>what are they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the most fundamental,</v>

464
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Judeo Christian values that we need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

465
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they have Christian values are the </v>

466
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.241
<v Speaker 2>bedrock of Western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are the foundation of what we have </v>

467
00:24:10.151 --> 00:24:14.980
<v Speaker 2>today in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is not a religious book at all.</v>

468
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.810
<v Speaker 2>You read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you endorsed it.</v>

469
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:22.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not a religious one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental freedoms.</v>

470
00:24:22.171 --> 00:24:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of speech.</v>

471
00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.860
<v Speaker 2>People don't realize where that freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from.</v>

472
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Israel,</v>

473
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.810
<v Speaker 2>the Hasidic Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they debate the Bible.</v>

474
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.150
<v Speaker 2>They 24 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all they do.</v>

475
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.610
<v Speaker 2>They debate the Bible and what does that</v>
<v Speaker 2>come from?</v>

476
00:24:36.611 --> 00:24:37.510
<v Speaker 2>The Bible says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come,</v>

477
00:24:37.511 --> 00:24:40.810
<v Speaker 2>let us reason together means let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate ideas.</v>

478
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.310
<v Speaker 2>I may not like your idea.</v>

479
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:47.310
<v Speaker 2>You may not like mine and we could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>five other people who make look at the </v>

480
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.031
<v Speaker 2>same verse completely differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason why we debate ideas is </v>

481
00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:53.650
<v Speaker 2>because we can learn from each other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>butter.</v>

482
00:24:53.651 --> 00:24:58.651
<v Speaker 2>Understand what statements mean were the</v>
<v Speaker 2>author who wrote that statement meant by</v>

483
00:24:59.381 --> 00:25:04.381
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know that God didn't write the </v>

484
00:25:04.381 --> 00:25:04.381
<v Speaker 2>Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People wrote the Bible,</v>

485
00:25:04.381 --> 00:25:06.010
<v Speaker 2>so part of our fundamental way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

486
00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:11.220
<v Speaker 2>the freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to come together and debate </v>

487
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:11.800
<v Speaker 2>ideas and passionately debate these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

488
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.580
<v Speaker 2>yet agreed to respectfully disagree and </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk away.</v>

489
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.420
<v Speaker 2>People don't realize that comes from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation of today,</v>

490
00:25:19.421 --> 00:25:21.900
<v Speaker 2>a Christian Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

491
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.580
<v Speaker 2>even people who are not religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

492
00:25:24.581 --> 00:25:27.280
<v Speaker 2>That's so uniquely Western.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

493
00:25:27.281 --> 00:25:28.950
<v Speaker 2>they don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

494
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.150
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Islamic world for example,</v>

495
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.460
<v Speaker 2>you don't debate ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

496
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Because in the car and the Qur'an was </v>
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>

497
00:25:36.521 --> 00:25:37.480
<v Speaker 2>it's the word of God.</v>

498
00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not negotiable.</v>

499
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.580
<v Speaker 2>You can not look back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can add change versus you don't even</v>

500
00:25:42.581 --> 00:25:47.581
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can even question it very different </v>

501
00:25:47.581 --> 00:25:48.010
<v Speaker 2>than the way we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I write in the book about,</v>

502
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 2>and I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a chapter titled The deaths of </v>

503
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Free Speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

504
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:58.141
<v Speaker 2>I talk about how we are losing our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to speak the truth because then </v>

505
00:25:58.241 --> 00:26:00.160
<v Speaker 2>your label,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your biggest people are afraid.</v>

506
00:26:00.161 --> 00:26:05.161
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to be blackmailed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to be boycotted the by going </v>

507
00:26:05.161 --> 00:26:05.161
<v Speaker 2>to lose my job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

508
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.710
<v Speaker 2>and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're silencing ourselves and that's why</v>

509
00:26:08.711 --> 00:26:12.140
<v Speaker 2>I titled the Book Rise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rise in defensive,</v>

510
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Judeo Christian values and freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're losing those freedoms,</v>

511
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.730
<v Speaker 2>those American values before our very </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>

512
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Are you watching this chip away more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe than in the United States right </v>

513
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.030
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For All our problems around this.</v>

514
00:26:24.031 --> 00:26:29.031
<v Speaker 1>And I agree it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bigger problem right now is that </v>

515
00:26:29.031 --> 00:26:29.150
<v Speaker 1>we're silencing ourselves rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government coming to silence us.</v>

516
00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Although that could potentially be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem in the future.</v>

517
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge problem right now.</v>

518
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Europe has a whole other set of problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>around free speech.</v>

519
00:26:36.631 --> 00:26:41.631
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they're more suited to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose faster because they don't have a </v>

520
00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:42.900
<v Speaker 1>first amendment the way we do?</v>

521
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That are far</v>

522
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.220
<v Speaker 1>more advanced than losing their rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their freedoms than we are.</v>

523
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.440
<v Speaker 1>And they did it by self censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

524
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I landed the lung than I will speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>in London in 2007.</v>

525
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:58.490
<v Speaker 1>So I land in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a standing there waiting for my </v>

526
00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.430
<v Speaker 1>luggage with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pilot and the hostess is,</v>

527
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:06.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in a private section and they </v>

528
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:06.700
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

529
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:06.700
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

530
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just here for like three days.</v>

531
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving a speech and parliament that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was speaking to the,</v>

532
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British parliament.</v>

533
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

534
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to be talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

535
00:27:13.741 --> 00:27:18.600
<v Speaker 1>the threat of radical Islam to world </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace and national security and all of a</v>

536
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 1>sudden silence for 30 seconds you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear a pin drop.</v>

537
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.840
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know how to react to what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

538
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.370
<v Speaker 1>They were so afraid to react less.</v>

539
00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Somebody hears something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That backseat driver,</v>

540
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 1>my driver picked me up to drive me to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel and we were talking in the car and</v>

541
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked me again,</v>

542
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:37.080
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said the same thing.</v>

543
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bridgette,</v>

544
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:44.090
<v Speaker 1>in 10 years I believe we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have blood on the streets of London by </v>

545
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.650
<v Speaker 1>radical Islamists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are at war.</v>

546
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:52.460
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't even take 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within five years we're already started </v>

547
00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 1>seeing stabbing on the streets of London</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

548
00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.680
<v Speaker 1>So in Europe they are afraid to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and they do not have the </v>

549
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.401
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech that we have and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's so important to defend </v>

550
00:28:04.401 --> 00:28:05.550
<v Speaker 1>the freedom of speech that we have and </v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless them.</v>

551
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Our founding fathers would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was them,</v>

552
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 1>they knew exactly what they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

553
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:10.770
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember they came from Europe,</v>

554
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:15.830
<v Speaker 1>so when they wrote us what they gave us </v>
<v Speaker 1>the constitution and our bill of rights </v>

555
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.401
<v Speaker 1>and all of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew exactly why they put some of </v>

556
00:28:19.401 --> 00:28:19.401
<v Speaker 1>these amendments at there.</v>

557
00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.420
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

558
00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.430
<v Speaker 1>so let's just put a Europe aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since we're in the United States,</v>

559
00:28:24.431 --> 00:28:26.530
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll deal with it here.</v>

560
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

561
00:28:27.851 --> 00:28:31.390
<v Speaker 1>We can get people to rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what else do we have to do to have a</v>

562
00:28:31.391 --> 00:28:36.391
<v Speaker 1>discussion about this that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop the people that are going to use </v>

563
00:28:36.391 --> 00:28:40.171
<v Speaker 1>all of those labels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know even in the book you make a </v>

564
00:28:40.171 --> 00:28:42.511
<v Speaker 1>point of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course this is not all Muslims and </v>

565
00:28:42.511 --> 00:28:45.220
<v Speaker 1>don't be bigoted towards Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were talking about an ideology,</v>

566
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.130
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have been doing that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of years,</v>

567
00:28:48.131 --> 00:28:53.131
<v Speaker 1>tried to separate people from ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that and still get all the labels </v>

568
00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:54.010
<v Speaker 1>thrown at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are some of the other techniques we</v>

569
00:28:54.011 --> 00:28:58.300
<v Speaker 1>can use to talk about these things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be crushed by by all the labor.</v>

570
00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Don't waste your breath because there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing you can say at this point.</v>

571
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.930
<v Speaker 2>No matter what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enemy,</v>

572
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.970
<v Speaker 2>the SPLC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Adl,</v>

573
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.110
<v Speaker 2>move on that or organizing for action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the progressive organizations,</v>

574
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.740
<v Speaker 2>they're not willing to listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to listen to you.</v>

575
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we organized a march against sharia,</v>

576
00:29:18.351 --> 00:29:21.470
<v Speaker 2>March for human rights last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year and a half ago,</v>

577
00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:26.850
<v Speaker 2>and we had rallies in 29 cities in 21 </v>
<v Speaker 2>states and we timed put the pulse </v>

578
00:29:27.591 --> 00:29:31.250
<v Speaker 2>nightclub bombing and Florida because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was June 10th.</v>

579
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:36.460
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to shine a light about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred of this ideology against gays.</v>

580
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.140
<v Speaker 2>What they do to gays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

581
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:43.190
<v Speaker 2>look at the pulse nightclub bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people organize our rallies in New </v>

582
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:48.000
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was organized and headed by two gay </v>

583
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.341
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rally in Atlanta was headed by a </v>

584
00:29:50.341 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Muslim man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we had an emom speaking in Seattle.</v>

585
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.850
<v Speaker 2>We had Miriam Abrahim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so then he's survivors.</v>

586
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Speak at that rally in Virginia beach as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as an Iranian Muslim leader of the </v>

587
00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Iranian movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

588
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:00.250
<v Speaker 2>to to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

589
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.280
<v Speaker 2>to avoid from the mullahs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you think any of the media covered </v>

590
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:05.280
<v Speaker 2>any of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All they did.</v>

591
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 2>They show up on the street corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say no.</v>

592
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.940
<v Speaker 2>It's say no to say no to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even bother understand what </v>

593
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.890
<v Speaker 2>we were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't waste your breath right now.</v>

594
00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:16.570
<v Speaker 2>People tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you speaking to the choir?</v>

595
00:30:16.571 --> 00:30:21.571
<v Speaker 2>Bridget?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to talk to other people at this </v>

596
00:30:21.571 --> 00:30:24.331
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to mobilize the choir because </v>

597
00:30:24.331 --> 00:30:26.230
<v Speaker 2>when you need your house cleaned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the choir that shows up.</v>

598
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 2>It is the choir that brings you food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're sick,</v>

599
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.350
<v Speaker 2>it is the choir that mops the church or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the temple when it needs cleaning.</v>

600
00:30:32.351 --> 00:30:36.340
<v Speaker 2>It's the choir that brings the flowers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's all that matters to keep your</v>

601
00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:40.270
<v Speaker 2>house up and keep it protected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why right now,</v>

602
00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 2>don't waste your breath on the labels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you fight.</v>

603
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you lobby our elected </v>
<v Speaker 2>officials.</v>

604
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you understand the power of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gavel,</v>

605
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.780
<v Speaker 2>why it is important to call your elected</v>
<v Speaker 2>officials.</v>

606
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.960
<v Speaker 2>You know in my book what makes this book</v>
<v Speaker 2>so unique is at the end of every </v>

607
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.220
<v Speaker 2>chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a section titled Dries Up and act</v>

608
00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.050
<v Speaker 2>where I give people ideas,</v>

609
00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:01.000
<v Speaker 1>so I want to do all that at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want all.</v>

610
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I want all of your absolute advice on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

611
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:05.270
<v Speaker 1>but what you hit on something that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is really interesting there.</v>

612
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:09.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a connection to all of this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the media reports.</v>

613
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

614
00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 1>that when they cover your events or when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cover,</v>

615
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:17.791
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that I'm friends with that I </v>

616
00:31:17.791 --> 00:31:17.791
<v Speaker 1>have on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they say,</v>

617
00:31:17.791 --> 00:31:22.350
<v Speaker 1>it's like they only focus on the haters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only focus on the one little </v>

618
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:27.450
<v Speaker 1>outsider that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's doing something that's bad and </v>

619
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:27.450
<v Speaker 1>not on all the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

620
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:32.020
<v Speaker 1>how do you think this happened to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media or is there a way that it can be </v>

621
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 1>fixed or does it need to burn to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground or what?</v>

622
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Because the progressive media is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in dialogue.</v>

623
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.370
<v Speaker 2>They are interested in winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

624
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.220
<v Speaker 2>we are on the conservative side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

625
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:48.230
<v Speaker 2>and it's such a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought of myself as a </v>

626
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.230
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

627
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:50.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I voted for Al Gore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a proud democrat.</v>

628
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

629
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.450
<v Speaker 2>conservative as they call us </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>

630
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is where we are in our nation </v>

631
00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.701
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They consider people like you </v>

632
00:32:01.701 --> 00:32:01.701
<v Speaker 2>conservative because you speak about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

633
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.890
<v Speaker 2>important issues that are now known as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

634
00:32:04.891 --> 00:32:06.540
<v Speaker 2>that's what the conservatives talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

635
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.960
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we are seeing right now is the </v>

636
00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:11.960
<v Speaker 2>media is interested in winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

637
00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.880
<v Speaker 2>we are interested in having a dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can we get through to them?</v>

638
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.950
<v Speaker 2>How can we speak with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.750
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and find the bridge where we can talk to</v>

640
00:32:18.751 --> 00:32:20.940
<v Speaker 2>them about that they're not interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in talking to us.</v>

641
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:26.210
<v Speaker 2>They're interesting in silencing our </v>
<v Speaker 2>voices and the sooner we know that the </v>

642
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.250
<v Speaker 2>better we are in fighting our battle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning how to win our battle.</v>

643
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.420
<v Speaker 2>And you add to that funders like </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorrows,</v>

644
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my book,</v>

645
00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:38.151
<v Speaker 2>I have a whole section about Soros and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't funding the media source right </v>

646
00:32:38.151 --> 00:32:39.520
<v Speaker 2>now has spent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that mean,</v>

647
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.600
<v Speaker 1>do you have an anti Semite if you talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Soros,</v>

648
00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:42.560
<v Speaker 1>that's their new meme.</v>

649
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.390
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know he was Jewish until </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a year ago.</v>

650
00:32:46.391 --> 00:32:51.391
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everything he does is usually </v>

651
00:32:51.391 --> 00:32:53.401
<v Speaker 2>against Israel and the height of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupidity.</v>

652
00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

653
00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think he sounds like an anti </v>

654
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.430
<v Speaker 2>semite much more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

655
00:33:00.431 --> 00:33:01.840
<v Speaker 2>he is the one who works with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors,</v>

656
00:33:01.841 --> 00:33:03.430
<v Speaker 2>with the Nazis on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

657
00:33:03.431 --> 00:33:04.210
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

658
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.370
<v Speaker 2>actually had a smile when people ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

659
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:11.520
<v Speaker 2>how did you feel about going in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>working with the Nazis against your own </v>

660
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:11.520
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

661
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:11.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

662
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.940
<v Speaker 2>somebody had to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know I to say any problem with it,</v>

663
00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not making that up either way.</v>

664
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:16.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

665
00:33:16.931 --> 00:33:21.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched his interview because I was </v>

666
00:33:21.931 --> 00:33:21.931
<v Speaker 2>very interested on what makes this man </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he is.</v>

667
00:33:21.931 --> 00:33:23.540
<v Speaker 2>I studied my enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

668
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.890
<v Speaker 2>I spend a lot of hours actually studying</v>
<v Speaker 2>my enemies,</v>

669
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand how they think,</v>

670
00:33:29.141 --> 00:33:30.730
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do they behave,</v>

671
00:33:30.731 --> 00:33:32.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to pick up on cues.</v>

672
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.300
<v Speaker 2>So you look at somebody like George </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soros,</v>

673
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:39.250
<v Speaker 2>who is interested in transforming </v>
<v Speaker 2>America into his vision of how the world</v>

674
00:33:39.251 --> 00:33:44.251
<v Speaker 2>should be and he has the billions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's willing to spend that $43 billion </v>

675
00:33:44.251 --> 00:33:46.900
<v Speaker 2>has already been spent on the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Soros funded media,</v>

676
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the teas from,</v>

677
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:49.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since 2002.</v>

678
00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:55.080
<v Speaker 2>And so when you look today at Soros has </v>
<v Speaker 2>tentacles that extend to a 33 media </v>

679
00:33:55.901 --> 00:33:57.790
<v Speaker 2>outlets including ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NBC,</v>

680
00:33:57.791 --> 00:33:59.110
<v Speaker 2>CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC,</v>

681
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.830
<v Speaker 2>the Washington Post Associated Press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I detail in my book.</v>

682
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the,</v>

683
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.220
<v Speaker 2>to give you an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I thought that the book,</v>

684
00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Columbia School of Journalism gave them </v>
<v Speaker 2>$600,000</v>

685
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:15.630
<v Speaker 2>to their journalism school because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to impact the reporting on how </v>

686
00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.680
<v Speaker 2>reporters report on the media issues in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>

687
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.620
<v Speaker 2>So nobody was paying attention to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

688
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:25.000
<v Speaker 2>But this is exactly how we ended up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>reporters who are no longer reporters.</v>

689
00:34:25.001 --> 00:34:29.050
<v Speaker 2>They are activists with a national </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform media platform.</v>

690
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get on television every night and </v>

691
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.200
<v Speaker 2>basically pure the same pocket political</v>
<v Speaker 2>points approved by Soros and they all </v>

692
00:34:36.371 --> 00:34:38.250
<v Speaker 2>say the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the Huffington Post,</v>

693
00:34:38.251 --> 00:34:40.270
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Associated Press,</v>

694
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Reuters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC,</v>

695
00:34:42.251 --> 00:34:43.420
<v Speaker 2>CNBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ABC,</v>

696
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.300
<v Speaker 2>the same buzzword and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>coordinated.</v>

697
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:51.470
<v Speaker 1>How concerned are you that on the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media front where people like you have </v>

698
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.510
<v Speaker 1>been able to make gains?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

699
00:34:51.511 --> 00:34:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll see every now and again you'll talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

700
00:34:53.101 --> 00:34:54.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just suddenly lost 5,000</v>

701
00:34:54.721 --> 00:34:56.550
<v Speaker 1>followers on twitter or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

702
00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.060
<v Speaker 1>That we're fighting a losing battle on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that front.</v>

703
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately because these companies are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are a lot of political </v>

704
00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:06.810
<v Speaker 1>connections and who knows what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on behind the scenes,</v>

705
00:35:06.811 --> 00:35:11.811
<v Speaker 1>but be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've basically embraced the leftist </v>

706
00:35:11.811 --> 00:35:15.951
<v Speaker 1>ideology and they're not really around </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that bridgette Gabriel's </v>

707
00:35:15.951 --> 00:35:16.170
<v Speaker 1>voice can be heard.</v>

708
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lose followers by the tens of </v>

709
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.790
<v Speaker 2>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands,</v>

710
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 2>and we are seeing that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially now at a dramatic pace.</v>

711
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you continue on doing what you are </v>

712
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:29.920
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

713
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.080
<v Speaker 2>there is nothing you can do to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

714
00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just continue pushing.</v>

715
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:37.120
<v Speaker 2>We are working with members of Congress </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make sure that there's fairness and </v>

716
00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.751
<v Speaker 2>reporting and that the government will </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervene to make sure that we don't </v>

717
00:35:40.751 --> 00:35:45.321
<v Speaker 2>have a monopoly look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did the same thing with </v>

718
00:35:45.321 --> 00:35:45.321
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember Microsoft data monopoly.</v>

719
00:35:45.321 --> 00:35:46.410
<v Speaker 2>The government had to intervene and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

720
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:51.411
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot stop anybody else who wants </v>

721
00:35:51.411 --> 00:35:53.771
<v Speaker 2>to develop computers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple didn't have a chance if the </v>

722
00:35:53.771 --> 00:35:53.771
<v Speaker 2>government didn't intervene with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft.</v>

723
00:35:53.771 --> 00:35:57.210
<v Speaker 2>So we know that there is precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here is the secret to success.</v>

724
00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:02.820
<v Speaker 1>My Libertarian brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the bells go off on that stuff </v>

725
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:02.820
<v Speaker 1>though because I don't want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government to do it.</v>

726
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like be last resort,</v>

727
00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.200
<v Speaker 1>even though I know that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a very personal issue to me as</v>

728
00:36:08.201 --> 00:36:10.090
<v Speaker 1>someone that puts this up on youtube and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of them</v>

729
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.950
<v Speaker 2>we want fairness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not telling them silence anybody,</v>

730
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.910
<v Speaker 2>but we are saying to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow people to speak their mind.</v>

731
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I owned a media platform and I do not</v>

732
00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:24.900
<v Speaker 2>agree with you at all in what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an American,</v>

733
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I will bite my tongue and grit my teeth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and listen to what I absolutely </v>

734
00:36:30.391 --> 00:36:32.010
<v Speaker 2>passionately opposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you,</v>

735
00:36:32.011 --> 00:36:33.420
<v Speaker 2>but anybody you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be saying,</v>

736
00:36:33.421 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever,</v>

737
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.860
<v Speaker 2>but I will fight for your right to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

738
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I will not silence you because it is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>American to silence you.</v>

739
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:46.980
<v Speaker 2>So as Americans we owe it to each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least to defend these,</v>

740
00:36:46.981 --> 00:36:49.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can so we can pass them out.</v>

741
00:36:49.741 --> 00:36:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Our Future generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never really own freedom,</v>

742
00:36:53.221 --> 00:36:58.221
<v Speaker 2>David.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only preserve it for the future </v>

743
00:36:58.221 --> 00:37:00.501
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said that statement with you </v>

744
00:37:00.501 --> 00:37:00.960
<v Speaker 2>before and I actually have it going all </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout my book.</v>

745
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.820
<v Speaker 2>These are the rights that our founding </v>
<v Speaker 2>fathers gave everything and most of them</v>

746
00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:08.790
<v Speaker 2>died broke to give us these rights that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have today.</v>

747
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.430
<v Speaker 2>The least we can do is preserve it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next generation.</v>

748
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:16.610
<v Speaker 2>That's all we're asking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know the secret to success </v>

749
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.820
<v Speaker 2>regardless of how much the social media </v>
<v Speaker 2>puts you on facebook jail or twitter </v>

750
00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:20.040
<v Speaker 2>bands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shadow,</v>

751
00:37:20.041 --> 00:37:20.850
<v Speaker 2>betty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

752
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Tenacity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tenacity,</v>

753
00:37:22.711 --> 00:37:24.870
<v Speaker 2>tenacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep on pushing.</v>

754
00:37:24.871 --> 00:37:27.900
<v Speaker 2>You keep on pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep on pushing and you never,</v>

755
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.820
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever give up.</v>

756
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.800
<v Speaker 2>That is the secret to success.</v>

757
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate we've talked for about 35 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

758
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:38.940
<v Speaker 1>We have not said the two words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump.</v>

759
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.900
<v Speaker 1>First up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we just had a record 35 minutes </v>

760
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:44.900
<v Speaker 1>of conversation without saying once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

761
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.960
<v Speaker 1>You are a trump supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a trumpeteer dear.</v>

762
00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a trumpet tier.</v>

763
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I think you've met with the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

764
00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

765
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.120
<v Speaker 1>how does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

766
00:37:55.130 --> 00:38:00.130
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell me something about him </v>

767
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:01.641
<v Speaker 1>maybe that the average person doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know or that you might not get through </v>

768
00:38:01.641 --> 00:38:05.661
<v Speaker 1>the filter of cnn or that you maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even get through the filter of </v>

769
00:38:05.661 --> 00:38:05.661
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

770
00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:10.310
<v Speaker 2>He is somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is a billionaire who left the life of</v>

771
00:38:10.311 --> 00:38:15.311
<v Speaker 2>luxury to serve the american people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is somebody who is not doing it for </v>

772
00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:18.950
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He already had power.</v>

773
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.980
<v Speaker 2>He's not doing it for fame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He already had fame.</v>

774
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:24.560
<v Speaker 2>He's not doing it for the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He already had money.</v>

775
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:30.400
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wakes up every morning to all the </v>

776
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.000
<v Speaker 2>insults and the hate and images of </v>
<v Speaker 2>beheading by cathy griffith.</v>

777
00:38:34.461 --> 00:38:39.461
<v Speaker 2>That's his can watch and be mortified </v>
<v Speaker 2>that somebodY actually really killed my </v>

778
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 2>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he remembers I'm not doing this</v>

779
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:47.221
<v Speaker 2>to police the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it because I'm fighting for </v>

780
00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:47.710
<v Speaker 2>the american people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hate him.</v>

781
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Not because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

782
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 2>they hate him because he is serving the </v>
<v Speaker 2>american people.</v>

783
00:38:54.491 --> 00:38:57.520
<v Speaker 2>He is putting America first and they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>not know how to handle him.</v>

784
00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:02.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's why Donald Trump is </v>
<v Speaker 2>resonating with a lot of people in this </v>

785
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:07.351
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from ceos of companies to janitors </v>

786
00:39:07.351 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 2>working for $10 an hour because from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>janitor to the ceo,</v>

787
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 2>they know.</v>

788
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:15.390
<v Speaker 2>And everybody in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Donald Trump is working for </v>

789
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:19.921
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a breath of fresh air because </v>

790
00:39:19.921 --> 00:39:21.490
<v Speaker 2>for decades now we have had manY </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidents on the right and the left,</v>

791
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 2>not many people could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barack obama's working for me,</v>

792
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:30.310
<v Speaker 2>or George Bush is working for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are clinton is working for me,</v>

793
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:36.360
<v Speaker 2>but with Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the janitor knows president Donald Trump</v>

794
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 2>is working for me and that's why he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>resonating with the people.</v>

795
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.740
<v Speaker 2>So when You see the tweets and some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the over the top stuff,</v>

796
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:50.490
<v Speaker 2>every now and again I'll watch some old </v>
<v Speaker 2>clips from him in the eighties talking </v>

797
00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.180
<v Speaker 2>to oprah or phil donahue and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's soft and seemingly plus,</v>

798
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:58.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very pleasant and open and you can see </v>

799
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:58.200
<v Speaker 2>the way inq and a's with audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>members.</v>

800
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.100
<v Speaker 2>I think our donahue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

801
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.780
<v Speaker 2>he's extremely human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these things.</v>

802
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.650
<v Speaker 2>and it's not exactly the caricature that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get these days.</v>

803
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:11.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that he sort of became this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because it was the only.</v>

804
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:16.770
<v Speaker 2>He basically was the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the only way he would have been </v>

805
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 2>hard enough to break through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

806
00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:22.021
<v Speaker 2>Like I think he was probably extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar to the person from back then,</v>

807
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:28.410
<v Speaker 2>but he became hardened because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way you were going to ever </v>

808
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:29.590
<v Speaker 2>break through this like no one else was </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever going to break through this thing.</v>

809
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:35.220
<v Speaker 2>If you listen to Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today is the exact same person he was 25</v>

810
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:43.990
<v Speaker 2>years ago when he was on phil donahue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was on oprah,</v>

811
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.560
<v Speaker 2>he still says the exact same words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you noticed?</v>

812
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Or the theme is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>

813
00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.160
<v Speaker 2>He's hard in now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a,</v>

814
00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:52.960
<v Speaker 2>and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even blaming him for that.</v>

815
00:40:52.961 --> 00:40:57.961
<v Speaker 2>I think to go through this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go through the media machine and the </v>

816
00:40:57.961 --> 00:40:58.640
<v Speaker 2>establishment and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get hardened.</v>

817
00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it will choke everybody out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what fights to win.</v>

818
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Before they didn't argue with what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

819
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:11.010
<v Speaker 2>so you didn't see that side of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have been just as hard back </v>

820
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:11.010
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today.</v>

821
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.730
<v Speaker 2>They did not want to listen to every </v>
<v Speaker 2>word he says.</v>

822
00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.180
<v Speaker 2>If he became jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will find a reason to fight against</v>

823
00:41:16.181 --> 00:41:16.870
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would call him,</v>

824
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:17.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil hater,</v>

825
00:41:17.891 --> 00:41:18.970
<v Speaker 2>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

826
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:19.750
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

827
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:25.200
<v Speaker 2>So the reason why they call him all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>names that they call him now is because </v>

828
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.950
<v Speaker 2>he has not toeing the line to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

829
00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.520
<v Speaker 2>he has 90 million followers on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

830
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.810
<v Speaker 2>trade around the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't need the media.</v>

831
00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.420
<v Speaker 2>He is communicating directly with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>american people and the media hates this</v>

832
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:39.590
<v Speaker 2>and he is somebody who fights the brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love his Tweets by the way,</v>

833
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.600
<v Speaker 2>but it makes a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>

834
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot believe he tweeted that.</v>

835
00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:48.660
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We finally have a man who stands up to </v>

836
00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 2>the bullyism punches back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are so used to men who are whizzes in</v>

837
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:56.051
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have forgotten what it's like to see </v>

838
00:41:56.051 --> 00:41:59.201
<v Speaker 2>a real man who stands up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect myself too much to let you </v>

839
00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:02.930
<v Speaker 2>walk all over me or call me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or treat me that way,</v>

840
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.330
<v Speaker 2>but if you treat me that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to punch you back.</v>

841
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up like a man and fight me.</v>

842
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.270
<v Speaker 2>We forgot how women like that looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

843
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:16.630
<v Speaker 2>and so Donald Trump is shocking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system at a time where men have been </v>

844
00:42:17.541 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 2>stripped out of their manhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

845
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:21.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

846
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the socIety is changing,</v>

847
00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roles are changing.</v>

848
00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:29.090
<v Speaker 2>So in our society today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want the man that they can walk all</v>

849
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:30.200
<v Speaker 2>over and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

850
00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:30.650
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

851
00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 2>we need somebody who is nice and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

852
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.510
<v Speaker 2>like romney or mccain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:40.840
<v Speaker 2>everybody loved mccain until he ran for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president than they did the same thing </v>

854
00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:40.840
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>

855
00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Everybody loved wrongly until he ran for</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

856
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:44.120
<v Speaker 2>They did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

857
00:42:44.121 --> 00:42:49.121
<v Speaker 2>if you would hear cnn talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>romney or mccain when they were running </v>

858
00:42:49.121 --> 00:42:49.121
<v Speaker 2>for president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were saying the same thing,</v>

859
00:42:49.121 --> 00:42:51.350
<v Speaker 2>but he hated women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of those things.</v>

860
00:42:51.351 --> 00:42:53.370
<v Speaker 2>So same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm completely with you on that part.</v>

861
00:42:53.371 --> 00:42:58.371
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I mean by the hardening of </v>

862
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:00.221
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he almost had to be this thing </v>

863
00:43:00.221 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 2>because nobody else could have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried it the other way.</v>

864
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:03.950
<v Speaker 2>They tried it with knight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.190
<v Speaker 2>nicer people so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just doesn't work.</v>

866
00:43:07.191 --> 00:43:08.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is,</v>

867
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:13.870
<v Speaker 2>this is the guy you're going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had his getting things done and the </v>

868
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:16.040
<v Speaker 2>american people are behind him and he is</v>
<v Speaker 2>resonating with the american people.</v>

869
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.430
<v Speaker 2>And if his message wasn't resonating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have the tens of millions of</v>

870
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:23.000
<v Speaker 2>followers that are following them on </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media and still rooting for him.</v>

871
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:28.150
<v Speaker 2>And the Donald Trump supporters dig </v>
<v Speaker 2>their heels even deeper where the only </v>

872
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:31.340
<v Speaker 2>attacks from the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the attacks from his own party.</v>

873
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

874
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 2>look you and I know there are people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>hates his guts in Washington dc.</v>

875
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:39.410
<v Speaker 2>You talk about cleaning the swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is shaking everybody the left and the</v>

876
00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:41.750
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite all that,</v>

877
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:47.020
<v Speaker 2>his support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his approval rating is at an all time </v>

878
00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:47.020
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

879
00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.490
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't matter what people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying to him.</v>

880
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:52.880
<v Speaker 2>He is doing what is right by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>american people by America.</v>

881
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.070
<v Speaker 2>So what are some of the policies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing that,</v>

882
00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:00.160
<v Speaker 2>that jive with this book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of borders and stuff like </v>

883
00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:00.160
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

884
00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.280
<v Speaker 2>you're for building the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

885
00:44:01.281 --> 00:44:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

886
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:07.040
<v Speaker 2>And here's Why I am an illegal immigrant</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the United States.</v>

887
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I understand what it's like for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to want to come here.</v>

888
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:13.550
<v Speaker 2>I want it to come here so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember getting an american flag,</v>

889
00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:16.280
<v Speaker 2>putting it under my pillow and my bomb </v>
<v Speaker 2>shelter.</v>

890
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't wait to come to America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned english.</v>

891
00:44:19.731 --> 00:44:24.731
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I shared with you this </v>
<v Speaker 2>was your less time writing subtitles on </v>

892
00:44:24.731 --> 00:44:25.430
<v Speaker 2>my own that I tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I learned english.</v>

893
00:44:25.431 --> 00:44:30.431
<v Speaker 2>I never studied english at school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so determined to come to the </v>

894
00:44:30.431 --> 00:44:34.031
<v Speaker 2>United States that we would watch black </v>
<v Speaker 2>and white television operated on a car </v>

895
00:44:34.031 --> 00:44:38.841
<v Speaker 2>battery in our bomb shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my father would watch the news and </v>

896
00:44:38.841 --> 00:44:39.090
<v Speaker 2>if there was any charge of the battery </v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

897
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I would watch the love boat on wednesday</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and dallas on friday night.</v>

898
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:44.940
<v Speaker 2>AnD you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

899
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:47.650
<v Speaker 2>we would have everything sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

900
00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's what impacted my life.</v>

901
00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:57.450
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if two people looked into each </v>

902
00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:58.971
<v Speaker 2>other's eyes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said something to her and she said </v>

903
00:44:58.971 --> 00:45:01.851
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would rise with maybe what met </v>

904
00:45:01.851 --> 00:45:01.851
<v Speaker 2>on the bottom.</v>

905
00:45:01.851 --> 00:45:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I knew that maybe meant whatever that </v>
<v Speaker 2>word in arabic.</v>

906
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.390
<v Speaker 2>And I would literally write it in ink on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my arm.</v>

907
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.640
<v Speaker 2>And because we barely had water to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink,</v>

908
00:45:08.641 --> 00:45:10.530
<v Speaker 2>let along shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We showered once a week.</v>

909
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:15.860
<v Speaker 2>I felt a huge victory valarie on my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I learned english because I </v>

910
00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.120
<v Speaker 2>was so determined that if I ever meet an</v>
<v Speaker 2>american,</v>

911
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate with them in their language </v>

912
00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 2>so I can get to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I came to the United States,</v>

913
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:27.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came to America by marriage.</v>

914
00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:30.840
<v Speaker 2>I had married an american war </v>
<v Speaker 2>correspondent in jerusalem.</v>

915
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.200
<v Speaker 2>We came to America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put in my papers to become an </v>

916
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:36.200
<v Speaker 2>american.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Flew here.</v>

917
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.311
<v Speaker 2>I paid for my airline ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid for my attorneys to do all my </v>

918
00:45:40.311 --> 00:45:43.221
<v Speaker 2>paperwork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faith for my doctor's visit to do all </v>

919
00:45:43.221 --> 00:45:46.640
<v Speaker 2>the needle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poking to make sure I'm tested for this </v>

920
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.101
<v Speaker 2>disease and that disease to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bringing anything to the </v>

921
00:45:49.101 --> 00:45:51.561
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I had to study it through inch </v>

922
00:45:51.561 --> 00:45:55.220
<v Speaker 2>thick book written by the daughters of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the american revolution about america's </v>

923
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:59.340
<v Speaker 2>history and heritage and pass a written </v>
<v Speaker 2>exam as well as a verbal exam in </v>

924
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:00.540
<v Speaker 2>english.</v>

925
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Before I became an american.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought america's history.</v>

926
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.800
<v Speaker 2>By the time I became an american,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew more about america's history than</v>

927
00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:12.600
<v Speaker 2>my own american born husband.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I am illegal immigrant.</v>

928
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Those are the type of immigrants who </v>
<v Speaker 2>need coming to America because we had a </v>

929
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.940
<v Speaker 2>fire in our belly to be all we can be as</v>
<v Speaker 2>americans right now.</v>

930
00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:23.280
<v Speaker 2>The people who are breaking the law to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get here,</v>

931
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:28.490
<v Speaker 2>not because they want to come here for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better life or they are escaping </v>

932
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:32.061
<v Speaker 2>persecution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the care event that's coming to </v>

933
00:46:32.061 --> 00:46:32.760
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico offered them asylum.</v>

934
00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Mexico offered them jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want it.</v>

935
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.460
<v Speaker 2>They're not there to seek jobs or </v>
<v Speaker 2>asylum,</v>

936
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:43.780
<v Speaker 2>they you and they passed literally by un</v>
<v Speaker 2>center setup specifically for those who </v>

937
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:49.041
<v Speaker 2>want asylum and claiming refugee status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even stop continued coming </v>

938
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:54.351
<v Speaker 2>to the United States to the border and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not even to the port of entry just to </v>

939
00:46:54.351 --> 00:46:55.080
<v Speaker 2>break the law gets here.</v>

940
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.380
<v Speaker 2>We have to have law and order in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

941
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.240
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I support Donald Trump,</v>

942
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:05.420
<v Speaker 2>build the wall and make sure anybody who</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to come to the United States can </v>

943
00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:09.381
<v Speaker 2>go through the proper channel and earn </v>
<v Speaker 2>the privilege to be an american because </v>

944
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.720
<v Speaker 2>it is a privilege because people like me</v>
<v Speaker 2>who did it by the book are insulted and </v>

945
00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.250
<v Speaker 2>offended when we see criminals are </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to come in here and have the </v>

946
00:47:19.261 --> 00:47:24.261
<v Speaker 2>same rights that we paid with our sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart and blood to get and work very </v>

947
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:29.271
<v Speaker 2>hard for years to become americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so fascinating to me because </v>

948
00:47:29.271 --> 00:47:29.740
<v Speaker 2>they've also done plenty of studies on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

949
00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Were</v>

950
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.980
<v Speaker 1>recent immigrants are actually against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the caravan and against a lot of these </v>

951
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.970
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because they have anything against </v>

952
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:39.970
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you did it the right way,</v>

953
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.250
<v Speaker 1>if you did it the way the law lays out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

954
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:47.251
<v Speaker 1>then you don't want people just just </v>
<v Speaker 1>storming over and that that is what a </v>

955
00:47:47.251 --> 00:47:47.251
<v Speaker 1>nation of laws is,</v>

956
00:47:47.251 --> 00:47:48.080
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't.</v>

957
00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:53.090
<v Speaker 2>When you look at what illegal </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration is costing the United </v>

958
00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:53.530
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know that $45,</v>

959
00:47:53.531 --> 00:47:58.531
<v Speaker 2>billion dollars a year leaves America </v>
<v Speaker 2>from those illegal aliens that come here</v>

960
00:47:59.861 --> 00:48:03.100
<v Speaker 2>to work in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that legal criminal aliens and they sent</v>

961
00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:06.310
<v Speaker 2>it to their countries of origin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That mOney is not staying here.</v>

962
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.460
<v Speaker 2>They're not here to become a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>american fabric to contribute to </v>

963
00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 2>american society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to grow,</v>

964
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:17.011
<v Speaker 2>to become all they can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are here to use our system and </v>

965
00:48:17.011 --> 00:48:20.851
<v Speaker 2>siphoned money and send it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that it costs the american </v>

966
00:48:20.851 --> 00:48:24.151
<v Speaker 2>public $200,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year and welfare expenses by criminal </v>

967
00:48:25.691 --> 00:48:30.691
<v Speaker 2>illegal aliens to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>3 million illegal aliens are </v>

968
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:35.790
<v Speaker 2>incarcerated dailY in american prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty percent of federal inmates in </v>

969
00:48:36.971 --> 00:48:39.400
<v Speaker 2>federal prisons are illegal criminal </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens.</v>

970
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.860
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at the cost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you add all the costs,</v>

971
00:48:41.861 --> 00:48:45.010
<v Speaker 2>and I can rattle in a bunch of points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you add it all up,</v>

972
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:50.100
<v Speaker 2>$338,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year is the cost of illegal </v>

973
00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:55.351
<v Speaker 2>immigration to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cost to build the wall is nothing </v>

974
00:48:55.351 --> 00:48:59.410
<v Speaker 2>compared to what we're paying annually </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lift illegal criminal aliens.</v>

975
00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention the crimes killing our </v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

976
00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] gangs coming here and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing to our society.</v>

977
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 2>We don't want any of that.</v>

978
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.720
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the same people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>will tell you that America is an evil </v>

979
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.280
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that monster that also want open borders</v>

980
00:49:15.281 --> 00:49:17.800
<v Speaker 1>to apparently share in that horror with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>

981
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.400
<v Speaker 2>AmerIca pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty flawed.</v>

982
00:49:20.401 --> 00:49:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Thinking there would absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>America is the most incredible nation on</v>

983
00:49:24.541 --> 00:49:25.800
<v Speaker 2>the face of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

984
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:28.290
<v Speaker 2>you traveled the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're traveling on a speaking tour.</v>

985
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:30.900
<v Speaker 2>I was born and raised on the other side </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

986
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I understand you and I have traveled the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

987
00:49:34.621 --> 00:49:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean from Australia to europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've been on a lot of places.</v>

988
00:49:38.851 --> 00:49:41.370
<v Speaker 2>You went on and we have seen how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

989
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:43.830
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the world lives compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rights that we have here.</v>

990
00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:49.010
<v Speaker 2>LOok,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our poorest of the poor who are living </v>

991
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:50.040
<v Speaker 2>on welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have dishwashers in their government,</v>

992
00:49:50.041 --> 00:49:52.860
<v Speaker 2>paid housing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have heating and air conditioning,</v>

993
00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:54.960
<v Speaker 2>have cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

994
00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:59.670
<v Speaker 2>these are luxury items and many other </v>
<v Speaker 2>places in the rest of the world.</v>

995
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Even in developed countries that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered luxurY items.</v>

996
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:06.810
<v Speaker 2>This is what we give to people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>living on welfare in the United States.</v>

997
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.930
<v Speaker 2>So those will complain about America </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to open their eyes.</v>

998
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.390
<v Speaker 2>They need to go to India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to the slums of India,</v>

999
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:15.210
<v Speaker 2>they need to visit the Philippines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to go to Vietnam.</v>

1000
00:50:15.211 --> 00:50:20.211
<v Speaker 2>They need to go to Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to see how the rest of the </v>

1001
00:50:20.211 --> 00:50:21.090
<v Speaker 2>world lives and then come back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>America and complain.</v>

1002
00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it just a lazy way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1003
00:50:23.491 --> 00:50:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Because it's just easier to destroy than</v>
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>

1004
00:50:25.861 --> 00:50:30.861
<v Speaker 1>so it's just easier to sit after all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hard one freedoms and tell you how </v>

1005
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:34.310
<v Speaker 1>horrible everything is rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually fix anything but burning things</v>

1006
00:50:34.311 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot easier,</v>

1007
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1008
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1009
00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 2>And they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1010
00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:43.360
<v Speaker 2>but no one's holding them accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see people like us and the old grade</v>

1011
00:50:43.361 --> 00:50:45.610
<v Speaker 2>generation who really fought world war </v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1012
00:50:45.611 --> 00:50:47.710
<v Speaker 2>who are the veterans are still lying </v>
<v Speaker 2>among us today.</v>

1013
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fought In the wars,</v>

1014
00:50:49.811 --> 00:50:52.240
<v Speaker 2>whether in Korea or in Vietnam or world </v>
<v Speaker 2>war two.</v>

1015
00:50:52.241 --> 00:50:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean now they're getting older and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fewer undying but their descendants.</v>

1016
00:50:55.391 --> 00:51:00.391
<v Speaker 2>So understand what America did to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and the freedoms that we helped </v>

1017
00:51:00.391 --> 00:51:01.540
<v Speaker 2>spread around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1018
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:06.630
<v Speaker 2>we didn't want anything from the Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We conquered nation and then we gave </v>

1019
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:07.000
<v Speaker 2>them their freedom and then rebuilt </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1020
00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:12.180
<v Speaker 2>who does that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't go to Iraq because we wanted </v>

1021
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.970
<v Speaker 2>oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't go to Afghanistan because we </v>

1022
00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:16.801
<v Speaker 2>wanted the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went there and started building </v>

1023
00:51:16.801 --> 00:51:17.650
<v Speaker 2>schools on bridges for them to improve </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives and left and didn't take any</v>

1024
00:51:17.651 --> 00:51:18.610
<v Speaker 2>of the oil with us.</v>

1025
00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:23.970
<v Speaker 2>We want to improve the world and we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight right now.</v>

1026
00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Those lazy american brats who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking ills of America,</v>

1027
00:51:28.601 --> 00:51:32.110
<v Speaker 2>who do not understand the America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to come together,</v>

1028
00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:36.220
<v Speaker 2>organize and rise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rise together in defense of America,</v>

1029
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:41.110
<v Speaker 2>and that's why we need to come together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and understand what we are facing,</v>

1030
00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.740
<v Speaker 2>how we are losing our country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what I get to in the book.</v>

1031
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:45.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

1032
00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:49.030
<v Speaker 2>how did we go from the stories of George</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington and the cherry tree?</v>

1033
00:51:49.031 --> 00:51:54.031
<v Speaker 2>I shall never tell a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did we go from that generation to </v>

1034
00:51:54.031 --> 00:51:55.150
<v Speaker 2>the antifa thug?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're born and raised in America,</v>

1035
00:51:55.151 --> 00:51:58.060
<v Speaker 2>went to american schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid for bY our tax dollars.</v>

1036
00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Who believe you can cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can lie,</v>

1037
00:52:00.071 --> 00:52:02.550
<v Speaker 2>you can still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can show up with machetes,</v>

1038
00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:03.640
<v Speaker 2>you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1039
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.650
<v Speaker 2>and brass knuckles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>YoU can hit people,</v>

1040
00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:10.890
<v Speaker 2>you can block bridges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can destroy property and you feel </v>

1041
00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:13.831
<v Speaker 2>justified doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we go in one generation and what </v>

1042
00:52:13.831 --> 00:52:16.570
<v Speaker 2>lifetime from this to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we need to stand up.</v>

1043
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Those of us who are in the middle who </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand America greatness need to </v>

1044
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:25.411
<v Speaker 2>come together and stand up to fight to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect America while we still have a </v>

1045
00:52:25.411 --> 00:52:25.411
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>

1046
00:52:25.411 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 1>So what are the other judeochristian </v>
<v Speaker 1>values that we need to be thinking </v>

1047
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about free speech.</v>

1048
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:34.701
<v Speaker 1>What are the other bedrock principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need to fight back some of this </v>

1049
00:52:34.701 --> 00:52:34.701
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1050
00:52:34.701 --> 00:52:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to fight to protect our </v>

1051
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.030
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explained something very easy to you.</v>

1052
00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:44.140
<v Speaker 2>You we cannot lose our language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Language unites people in one nation,</v>

1053
00:52:44.141 --> 00:52:49.141
<v Speaker 2>the english language right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are importing people from different </v>

1054
00:52:49.141 --> 00:52:51.790
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world and we are not making</v>
<v Speaker 2>them learn english.</v>

1055
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.750
<v Speaker 2>We now have public schools that have 16 </v>
<v Speaker 2>different languages that are spoken in a</v>

1056
00:52:55.751 --> 00:52:58.410
<v Speaker 2>public school and teachers will have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be trained to,</v>

1057
00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:00.970
<v Speaker 2>to speak a certain language to children </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of saying,</v>

1058
00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:01.720
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1059
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:06.770
<v Speaker 2>you came to America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to assimilate to need to learn </v>

1060
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.881
<v Speaker 2>english.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know spanish people who have been in </v>

1061
00:53:08.881 --> 00:53:08.920
<v Speaker 2>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mexican people for over 20 years,</v>

1062
00:53:08.921 --> 00:53:12.130
<v Speaker 2>they still cannot speak english properly</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they speak very little english.</v>

1063
00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:14.920
<v Speaker 2>That's not acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what made America great.</v>

1064
00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:20.130
<v Speaker 2>We have got to enforce that english is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the official language of the United </v>

1065
00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:20.440
<v Speaker 2>States and shall remain.</v>

1066
00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.720
<v Speaker 2>So we welcome people from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds.</v>

1067
00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:25.090
<v Speaker 2>The immigrants that came to this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

1068
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.850
<v Speaker 2>the jews that came from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1069
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.760
<v Speaker 2>the irish catholics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1070
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.080
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came to the United States.</v>

1071
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:36.140
<v Speaker 2>They made sure their children spoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>english because they wanted their kids </v>

1072
00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:40.701
<v Speaker 2>to become as american as apple pie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as fast as possible to assimilate into </v>

1073
00:53:40.701 --> 00:53:42.690
<v Speaker 2>the society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not seeing that right now.</v>

1074
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.020
<v Speaker 2>We are seeing in detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call government the office,</v>

1075
00:53:46.021 --> 00:53:47.480
<v Speaker 2>you're getting in arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1076
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:50.730
<v Speaker 2>and then you push like forfor english,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arabic,</v>

1077
00:53:50.731 --> 00:53:52.980
<v Speaker 2>and then you got spanish and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get this and this and that.</v>

1078
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:56.970
<v Speaker 2>That's unacceptable and people need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand their power.</v>

1079
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:59.880
<v Speaker 2>And my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of every chapter,</v>

1080
00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I have a section title dries up and act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what I'm talking about,</v>

1081
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I give people ideas and tips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three things you can do under 10 minutes</v>

1082
00:54:07.561 --> 00:54:12.561
<v Speaker 2>that will make a difference for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and you can do them slipping </v>

1083
00:54:12.561 --> 00:54:13.650
<v Speaker 2>your cup of coffee in your pajamas at </v>
<v Speaker 2>7:00</v>

1084
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:17.010
<v Speaker 2>AM in the morning to give you an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling your elected official.</v>

1085
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Many people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bridgette,</v>

1086
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:23.450
<v Speaker 2>what is my voice going to count?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My eleCted official needs to hear from </v>

1087
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:24.660
<v Speaker 2>40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people before they do something wrong.</v>

1088
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I talked to elected officials all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and I asked them,</v>

1089
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:32.190
<v Speaker 2>how many people do you need to hear from</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a single issue to make it your top</v>

1090
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:34.470
<v Speaker 2>priority?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be shocked.</v>

1091
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:35.850
<v Speaker 2>How many do you think?</v>

1092
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's got to be so ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 1>low because nobody calls them and we all</v>

1093
00:54:40.331 --> 00:54:45.331
<v Speaker 1>think it's 40,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably like 50 people or </v>

1094
00:54:45.331 --> 00:54:45.331
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1095
00:54:45.331 --> 00:54:48.630
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty to 50 people and here is the </v>

1096
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:50.380
<v Speaker 2>science behind the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe if one person makes a phone</v>

1097
00:54:50.381 --> 00:54:54.010
<v Speaker 2>call or writes a letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he or she are representing $1,000,</v>

1098
00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:59.060
<v Speaker 2>but they those who feel the same way but</v>
<v Speaker 2>are too lazy to make a phone call or </v>

1099
00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.850
<v Speaker 2>write a letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet they vote on election day.</v>

1100
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:05.920
<v Speaker 2>That translates to 40 to 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>voters on election day.</v>

1101
00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:09.520
<v Speaker 2>That can make or break an election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I tell people,</v>

1102
00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:12.370
<v Speaker 2>you can be active sitting in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>

1103
00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:17.490

<v Speaker 2>How many hours do you spend sitting in </v>

1104
00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:21.061
<v Speaker 2>traffic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent two and a half hours yesterday </v>

1105
00:55:21.061 --> 00:55:21.850
<v Speaker 2>sitting in traffic trying to go 50 miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>

1106
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:26.910
<v Speaker 2>the white house phone number program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your elected officials phone number in </v>

<v Speaker 2>which I mentioned all throughout the </v>

1113
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.410
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my organization act for America,</v>

<v Speaker 2>action alerts.</v>

1116
00:55:46.331 --> 00:55:48.700
<v Speaker 2>We send emails about bill's coming down </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a vote.</v>

1117
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.650
<v Speaker 2>The bill number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who sponsors it,</v>

1118
00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:55.680
<v Speaker 2>what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We even have pre written letters for </v>

<v Speaker 2>officials with the click of a button.</v>

<v Speaker 2>letters to the editors and script.</v>

1121
00:56:02.021 --> 00:56:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I give samples in this book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last chapter,</v>

1122
00:56:04.391 --> 00:56:09.391
<v Speaker 2>the whole chapter is samples about </v>
<v Speaker 2>activism samples about letters to the </v>

1123
00:56:09.581 --> 00:56:14.581
<v Speaker 2>editor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is add your name and </v>

1124
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:14.581
<v Speaker 2>send it to your newspaper.</v>

1125
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 1>As part of the problem that we put so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much emphasis on the presidency,</v>

1126
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:18.170
<v Speaker 1>so it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing local activism.</v>

1127
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:21.270
<v Speaker 1>You're saying call your congressman if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a problem with your exit.</v>

1128
00:56:21.271 --> 00:56:26.271
<v Speaker 1>My exit right here where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say exactly where it's </v>

1129
00:56:26.271 --> 00:56:26.350
<v Speaker 1>filled with garbage for the two years </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been living here,</v>

1130
00:56:26.351 --> 00:56:29.120
<v Speaker 1>david's been calling this guy nonstop to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the.</v>

1131
00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:30.880
<v Speaker 1>He wants to go out there and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up stuff,</v>

1132
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:32.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's too dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just.</v>

1133
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:37.530
<v Speaker 1>But like nobody focuses on local anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we put such emphasis on the </v>

1134
00:56:38.201 --> 00:56:43.201
<v Speaker 1>executive branch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the cult of personality around the </v>

1135
00:56:43.201 --> 00:56:45.871
<v Speaker 1>presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like by going to your local </v>

1136
00:56:45.871 --> 00:56:47.830
<v Speaker 1>congressman or congresswoman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might actually get something done.</v>

1137
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:49.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot harder to do it the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1138
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and on the local elected offiCials,</v>

1139
00:56:52.831 --> 00:56:53.660
<v Speaker 2>you kNow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your local,</v>

1140
00:56:53.661 --> 00:56:58.661
<v Speaker 2>state aNd delegates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may have you called the guy at the 12 </v>

1141
00:56:58.661 --> 00:56:58.661
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1142
00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:01.190
<v Speaker 2>And so this is why we started chapters </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationwide.</v>

1143
00:57:01.191 --> 00:57:02.840
<v Speaker 2>This is why we have activists </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationwide.</v>

1144
00:57:02.841 --> 00:57:05.090
<v Speaker 2>I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to act for America.</v>

1145
00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:09.360
<v Speaker 2>That org sign up as an activist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joined a chapter or started chapter,</v>

1146
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:14.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a chapter near you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything happens on a local level </v>

1147
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:15.920
<v Speaker 2>because those local elected officials </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you develop a connection with,</v>

1148
00:57:15.921 --> 00:57:19.310
<v Speaker 2>an eye contact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to become state elected officials.</v>

1149
00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Then federal elected officials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attorney generals,</v>

1150
00:57:21.921 --> 00:57:23.540
<v Speaker 2>and then state senators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>congressmen.</v>

1151
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:28.930
<v Speaker 2>This is how we change society and so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>encourage people to get involved and </v>

1152
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:33.251
<v Speaker 2>become engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what this book is a </v>

1153
00:57:33.251 --> 00:57:36.101
<v Speaker 2>roadmap for people on how to rise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rise this title that dries,</v>

1154
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:42.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to get this book and they </v>

1155
00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.260
<v Speaker 2>need to donate it to every library in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their community.</v>

1156
00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:47.420
<v Speaker 2>So when people are looking to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

1157
00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.640
<v Speaker 2>they can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read it for yourself,</v>

1158
00:57:49.641 --> 00:57:51.590
<v Speaker 2>donate it to a public library in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

1159
00:57:51.591 --> 00:57:56.591
<v Speaker 2>get multiple copies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want people to learn how they can be </v>

1160
00:57:56.591 --> 00:57:58.250
<v Speaker 2>mobilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left understands how to mobilize.</v>

1161
00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.440
<v Speaker 2>We on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the issues,</v>

1162
00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.470
<v Speaker 2>but do not know how to mobilize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what this book teaches them.</v>

1163
00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:05.370
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

1164
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:10.430
<v Speaker 1>What else can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you got a couple of other </v>

1165
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.430
<v Speaker 1>tricks up your sleeve.</v>

1166
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1167
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't just be calling your </v>

1168
00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:15.420
<v Speaker 1>congressman,</v>

1169
00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:16.830
<v Speaker 2>make new friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out,</v>

1170
00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:19.380
<v Speaker 2>start a chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get to meet the great new friends</v>

1171
00:58:19.381 --> 00:58:21.960
<v Speaker 2>in your community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people sign up to be a chapter leader</v>

1172
00:58:21.961 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 2>with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will connect them with the same group</v>

1173
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.170
<v Speaker 2>in their local community who sign up for</v>
<v Speaker 2>our emails and they say,</v>

1174
00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:33.171
<v Speaker 2>I want to join a chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to meet people in my community </v>

1175
00:58:33.171 --> 00:58:33.171
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We connect them together.</v>

1176
00:58:33.171 --> 00:58:35.820
<v Speaker 2>They can do local activities together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can go out to dinners together.</v>

1177
00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:38.910
<v Speaker 2>They can work on issues relating to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their community.</v>

1178
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I have found I have made the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends doing my activism.</v>

1179
00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.730
<v Speaker 2>That's what launched my career in </v>
<v Speaker 2>activism.</v>

1180
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:47.640
<v Speaker 2>So this is the type of ideas that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do.</v>

1181
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Come together and work together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have on a saturday,</v>

1182
00:58:50.461 --> 00:58:52.440
<v Speaker 2>one saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a meeting,</v>

1183
00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.480
<v Speaker 2>a chapter meeting once a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write letters to your congressman about </v>

1184
00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:57.510
<v Speaker 2>the garbage on the side of the street.</v>

1185
00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:00.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to clean this garbage out.</v>

1186
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.530
<v Speaker 2>This is unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A probe test builds up or coming down.</v>

1187
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're accepting all these refugees </v>

1188
00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:12.081
<v Speaker 2>coming in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so right now we are bringing our </v>

1189
00:59:12.081 --> 00:59:15.171
<v Speaker 2>standards down to accommodate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standards of people from third world </v>

1190
00:59:15.171 --> 00:59:15.450
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To give you an example,</v>

1191
00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:20.451
<v Speaker 2>the city of denver in 2017 passed an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinance that allowed people to on the </v>

1192
00:59:22.341 --> 00:59:23.900
<v Speaker 2>sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1193
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:29.110
<v Speaker 2>because they have a lot of illegal </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants who feel no problem to just </v>

1194
00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 2>drop their pants and do it on the side </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the road,</v>

1195
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:36.460
<v Speaker 2>but because it is a deportable crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that crime is punishable up to </v>

1196
00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:38.360
<v Speaker 2>one year in jail and if you commit such </v>
<v Speaker 2>a crime,</v>

1197
00:59:38.361 --> 00:59:43.361
<v Speaker 2>you are deported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The city of denver has a bigger problem </v>

1198
00:59:43.361 --> 00:59:44.270
<v Speaker 2>with illegal immigration than san </v>
<v Speaker 2>francisco and philadelphia,</v>

1199
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:47.600
<v Speaker 2>so that's why they passed the ordinance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did not want people deported.</v>

1200
00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if you have a chapter </v>
<v Speaker 2>with 30 people or 30 people organizing </v>

1201
00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:57.551
<v Speaker 2>together on the same issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling your local state government </v>

1202
00:59:57.551 --> 01:00:01.180
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is unacceptable and if you don't </v>

1203
01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.791
<v Speaker 2>change that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to vote you out and replace </v>

1204
01:00:03.791 --> 01:00:03.791
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how the left does it.</v>

1205
01:00:03.791 --> 01:00:04.490
<v Speaker 2>That's how we need to do it.</v>

1206
01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty clear one where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could probably escape some of the cries </v>

1207
01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>of racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1208
01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>because nobody wants their streets </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled up with pooper.</v>

1209
01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>san francisco has this app that'll tell </v>

1210
01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you where human poop is</v>

1211
01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:20.080
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable and now that diseases that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are spreading because of that,</v>

1212
01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:21.910
<v Speaker 2>and this is something I mentioned in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

1213
01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.100
<v Speaker 2>all the rise in diseases in our country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1214
01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:30.180
<v Speaker 2>you've heard right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the lyme disease or that disease </v>

1215
01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.461
<v Speaker 2>that's not being transferred to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because in san francisco you've got </v>

1216
01:00:32.461 --> 01:00:37.111
<v Speaker 2>flies basically eating that human waste </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're walking down the street </v>

1217
01:00:37.121 --> 01:00:40.570
<v Speaker 2>and they're biting you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so mosquitoes now are transferring these</v>

1218
01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:45.370
<v Speaker 2>diseases that were once eliminated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States by simply eating human</v>

1219
01:00:45.371 --> 01:00:48.040
<v Speaker 2>waste and them biting you with putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in your body.</v>

1220
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.110
<v Speaker 2>This is exactly why I bought a month </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1221
01:00:50.111 --> 01:00:51.070
<v Speaker 2>We started seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1222
01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.290
<v Speaker 2>this disease pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People cannot explain it.</v>

1223
01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:55.630
<v Speaker 2>some people died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuberculosis,</v>

1224
01:00:55.631 --> 01:00:58.300
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is exploding in the United States.</v>

1225
01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:01.960
<v Speaker 2>The top four states with tuberculosis </v>
<v Speaker 2>are California.</v>

1226
01:01:01.961 --> 01:01:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Over 500 cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>

1227
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Texas and New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A 16 states are now grappling with </v>

1228
01:01:10.211 --> 01:01:10.960
<v Speaker 2>tuberculosis.</v>

1229
01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:13.270
<v Speaker 2>It is the fAstest growing disease in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America right now.</v>

1230
01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:18.720
<v Speaker 2>They have state of Wisconsin alone has </v>
<v Speaker 2>116 cases of tuberculosis and the </v>

1231
01:01:19.931 --> 01:01:24.190
<v Speaker 2>majority of them are drug resistant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means it takes six months to treat</v>

1232
01:01:24.191 --> 01:01:29.191
<v Speaker 2>a patient and it takes six to eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>months to treat them at the cost of </v>

1233
01:01:29.191 --> 01:01:32.500
<v Speaker 2>$150,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>per patient out of our tax dollars.</v>

1234
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.800
<v Speaker 2>These are issues we need to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>THese are issues affecting our </v>

1235
01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.460
<v Speaker 2>communities and that's what I what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed in the book.</v>

1236
01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:42.430
<v Speaker 2>So it's not only about national security</v>
<v Speaker 2>per se,</v>

1237
01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:47.580
<v Speaker 2>it's why we need to rise in defense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our culture and our freedoms and what </v>

1238
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:47.580
<v Speaker 2>made America great.</v>

1239
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you find that the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of act are diverse politically </v>

1240
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.510
<v Speaker 1>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1241
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've spent hours with you now and</v>

1242
01:01:55.131 --> 01:01:58.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're a conservative but you're</v>

1243
01:01:58.341 --> 01:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1244
01:01:58.801 --> 01:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of my kind of conservative.</v>

1245
01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1246
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like my kind of liberal,</v>

1247
01:02:06.671 --> 01:02:11.671
<v Speaker 1>which you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you know is half conservative at </v>

1248
01:02:11.671 --> 01:02:11.671
<v Speaker 1>this point because everything is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>upside down,</v>

1249
01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.800
<v Speaker 1>but do you find that you get a real mix </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a political views in the people that </v>

1250
01:02:16.871 --> 01:02:17.410
<v Speaker 1>are coming to you?</v>

1251
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look with our organizations.</v>

1252
01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:25.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean we Have everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that put their differences aside </v>

1253
01:02:25.431 --> 01:02:29.780
<v Speaker 2>and came together for the safety and </v>
<v Speaker 2>security of America and preserving </v>

1254
01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:34.700
<v Speaker 2>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are as americans and defending our </v>

1255
01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.760
<v Speaker 2>american values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our members are jews,</v>

1256
01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:36.960
<v Speaker 2>christians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddhists,</v>

1257
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.370
<v Speaker 2>hindus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheists,</v>

1258
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.660
<v Speaker 2>gays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbians.</v>

1259
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got gay chapter leaders,</v>

1260
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.690
<v Speaker 2>chapter leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to everybody.</v>

1261
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:48.810
<v Speaker 2>People like you and I and everybody else</v>
<v Speaker 2>that put.</v>

1262
01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1263
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.290
<v Speaker 2>people may not agree on every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>social issues,</v>

1264
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:57.710
<v Speaker 2>but people agree on a lot of things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>make us americans because we love each </v>

1265
01:02:57.710 --> 01:03:02.001
<v Speaker 2>other as americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We respect eacH other as americans and </v>

1266
01:03:02.001 --> 01:03:04.140
<v Speaker 2>we want to defend our country and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles that made it great.</v>

1267
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.290
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why we work together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like I said,</v>

1268
01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.460
<v Speaker 2>it's such a shame that no people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1269
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I never thought I would be.</v>

1270
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1271
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I will be called the conservative or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be called the conservative,</v>

1272
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.110
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as the leftist concern,</v>

1273
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.190
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I are conservatives.</v>

1274
01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:23.640
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't matter that you are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>married gay man.</v>

1275
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:29.420
<v Speaker 2>You're a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the new conservatism and you </v>

1276
01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:33.831
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why when Donald Trump talks </v>

1277
01:03:33.831 --> 01:03:34.350
<v Speaker 2>about nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we aren't nationalist country.</v>

1278
01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:39.830
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are standing up as a nation to fight </v>

1279
01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:43.130
<v Speaker 2>what makes America great patriotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>american.</v>

1280
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.630
<v Speaker 2>You know the patriotism that we have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

1281
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.460
<v Speaker 2>They don't have another countries of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1282
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.550
<v Speaker 2>You go to Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see the australian flag flying</v>

1283
01:03:50.551 --> 01:03:55.551
<v Speaker 2>everywhere you go to england.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see that in british flag </v>

1284
01:03:55.551 --> 01:03:55.551
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We noticed that when I was in here.</v>

1285
01:03:55.551 --> 01:04:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Now that you're traveling worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what makes America so unique is this </v>

1286
01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:05.160
<v Speaker 2>nationalism that brings us altogether </v>
<v Speaker 2>our love for country.</v>

1287
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:09.840
<v Speaker 2>People go to baseball games and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>played tHe national anthem.</v>

1288
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't do that in other parts of the</v>

1289
01:04:11.761 --> 01:04:16.761
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't play the national anthem </v>

1290
01:04:16.761 --> 01:04:18.891
<v Speaker 2>before games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We take it for granted and now </v>

1291
01:04:18.891 --> 01:04:21.591
<v Speaker 2>everybody's upset with the president </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's talking about american </v>

1292
01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:21.591
<v Speaker 2>nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1293
01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:23.580
<v Speaker 2>What brings us together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to travel to Australia,</v>

1294
01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.480
<v Speaker 2>go to Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Germany,</v>

1295
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:31.490
<v Speaker 2>attend a a football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think they don't play the national </v>

1296
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:33.120
<v Speaker 2>anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the United States.</v>

1297
01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.510
<v Speaker 2>THat's what he was referring to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about our nationalism.</v>

1298
01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.640
<v Speaker 2>What brings us together as americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our americanism.</v>

1299
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:42.210
<v Speaker 2>He could have used a different word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americanism.</v>

1300
01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.700
<v Speaker 2>So the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the left will not feel offended,</v>

1301
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.950
<v Speaker 2>but that's what he was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty fair.</v>

1302
01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:51.951
<v Speaker 2>they would have offended either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have been offended either </v>

1303
01:04:51.951 --> 01:04:54.291
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel I should give you the chance to </v>

1304
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:54.291
<v Speaker 2>close this with this speech as epic as </v>
<v Speaker 2>your last,</v>

1305
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.180
<v Speaker 2>although you've done about five of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>here in the last hour,</v>

1306
01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:00.740
<v Speaker 2>but do you want to give me a closing </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement that will be memorable.</v>

1307
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Footprints in history are not made </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting down.</v>

1308
01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Countries cannot be saved by Hashtags </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tweets.</v>

1309
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:15.810
<v Speaker 2>We need to stand up and put some sweat </v>
<v Speaker 2>equity into saving our country,</v>

1310
