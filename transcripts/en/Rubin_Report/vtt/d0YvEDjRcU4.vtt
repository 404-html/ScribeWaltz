1
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Years</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.933
<v Speaker 2>is upon us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to be doing a little </v>

3
00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:05.254
<v Speaker 2>progress report here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you guys had a chance to check </v>

4
00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:09.760
<v Speaker 2>out my interview from last week with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Boghossian.</v>

5
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 2>For those of you that might have missed </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

6
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:15.880
<v Speaker 2>My intention with Peter was to focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheism as well as critical thinking.</v>

7
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.610
<v Speaker 2>These are ideas that Peter wrote his </v>
<v Speaker 2>book about,</v>

8
00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:19.444
<v Speaker 2>spends most of his time talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>and are obviously topics that I'm </v>

9
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:22.894
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at about 13 questions prepared </v>

10
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 2>for Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like many of my interviews,</v>

11
00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:27.874
<v Speaker 2>the conversation pretty much just took a</v>
<v Speaker 2>life of its own and last week's case </v>

12
00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:31.924
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something particularly interesting </v>

13
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.693
<v Speaker 2>happened no matter how far I tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>steer the conversation away from the </v>

14
00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 2>regressive left and I tried many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All roads kept leading back to them.</v>

15
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.593
<v Speaker 2>I've mentioned to you guys a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>times now how I want to talk about all </v>

16
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:46.414
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things on this show from </v>
<v Speaker 2>science to politics to spirituality and </v>

17
00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:50.104
<v Speaker 2>much more.</v>

18
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.063
<v Speaker 2>I've also mentioned to you guys how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to solely focus on the </v>

19
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 2>regressive left primarily because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't necessarily solve anything.</v>

20
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find myself incredibly torn about this</v>

21
00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 2>topic on one hand until the last couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

22
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 2>we hadn't even diagnosed the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the regressive left,</v>

23
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.024
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly huge numbers of those of you on </v>

24
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:12.700
<v Speaker 2>the left were upset about how your team </v>
<v Speaker 2>was being hijacked,</v>

25
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:15.160
<v Speaker 2>but there wasn't a place to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and talk about it,</v>

26
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.383
<v Speaker 2>much less a whole group of likeminded </v>
<v Speaker 2>people willing to share their </v>

27
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 2>experiences and tell their stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For that reason,</v>

28
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I've wanted to keep this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

29
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.100
<v Speaker 2>It's important to realize how many of us</v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually out there.</v>

30
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot we want to fix the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think we can without getting</v>

31
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:35.230
<v Speaker 2>to critical mass on the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

32
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't sense that we can actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>change these regressives.</v>

33
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.500
<v Speaker 2>As I've also mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since we've started doing the show,</v>

34
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.573
<v Speaker 2>I've seen these guys continue to lie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>smear opponents only to be caught and </v>

35
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:47.194
<v Speaker 2>then doubled down or even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are fighting back against </v>

36
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:52.630
<v Speaker 2>these lies with facts and logic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately,</v>

37
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 2>I've had several of these people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

38
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.990
<v Speaker 2>like my new eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Hater,</v>

39
00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:59.290
<v Speaker 2>and God said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>others I know only from the online space</v>

40
00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:02.080
<v Speaker 2>such as my guest this week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ali Rizvi Ali's,</v>

41
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:02.914
<v Speaker 2>an atheist Muslim who's constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing about and fighting against </v>

42
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:07.414
<v Speaker 2>regressive ideology growing up mainly in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia and ultimately leaving </v>

43
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 2>religion for secularism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should be a natural hero of the left.</v>

44
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not a.</v>

45
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the many things that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to talk about.</v>

46
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 2>I go back and forth between thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fighting the regressives by putting</v>

47
00:02:23.411 --> 00:02:24.244
<v Speaker 2>time and energy into discussing them is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what will ultimately do the most to </v>

48
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:27.874
<v Speaker 2>change the landscape of the left and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then just thinking that if we ignore </v>

49
00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:32.050
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they'll go away.</v>

50
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.243
<v Speaker 2>I tend to think that most of you will </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me that we have to keep amplifying </v>

51
00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:41.110
<v Speaker 2>real liberal voices and that by ignoring</v>
<v Speaker 2>them will only let their influence grow.</v>

52
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.213
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much what I think too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must say that I'm incredibly inspired </v>

53
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:49.540
<v Speaker 2>by the fact that half the time when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>see anything that they write,</v>

54
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.403
<v Speaker 2>tweet or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an army of people ready to </v>

55
00:02:52.991 --> 00:02:53.824
<v Speaker 2>combat their bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few people have mentioned to me that </v>

56
00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:56.704
<v Speaker 2>they believe that this whole regressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and the fuel it gives to the </v>

57
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 2>right is only gonna get worse before it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets better.</v>

58
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.933
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think these people are probably </v>

59
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>correct until the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate,</v>

60
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 2>true voices of liberalism can come back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the forefront.</v>

61
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.973
<v Speaker 2>This conversation is always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck between the regressives and the </v>

62
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 2>trumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like we've got our work cut out</v>

63
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:22.621
<v Speaker 2>for us for 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guest this week is Ali Rizvi.</v>

64
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Allie writes for the Huffington Post and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his first book,</v>

65
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.793
<v Speaker 2>the atheist Muslim losing my religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not my identity is being published </v>

66
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.074
<v Speaker 2>in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a strong advocate for the </v>

67
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 2>advancement of secularism and science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the Muslim world.</v>

68
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Allie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome to the show.</v>

69
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.151
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>

70
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:40.984
<v Speaker 3>glad to be on.</v>

71
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.163
<v Speaker 2>So we've been doing this as I start </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all my shows by saying that the </v>

72
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:45.974
<v Speaker 2>guests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been doing this on twitter for a </v>

73
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:51.170
<v Speaker 2>while and you are another one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>anti regressive warriors.</v>

74
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.600
<v Speaker 2>So I'm happy that you're joining me this</v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

75
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

76
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 3>you can't help but be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just uh,</v>

77
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.450
<v Speaker 3>doing anything like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost synonymous.</v>

78
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

79
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 2>it absolutely is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

80
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna.</v>

81
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.263
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk a little bit about the regressives </v>

82
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's,</v>

83
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.173
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about you first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want people to understand sort of who </v>

84
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you come from a,</v>

85
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you spent most of your youth up until </v>
<v Speaker 2>your early teens in Saudi Arabia.</v>

86
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:16.144
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

87
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.071
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

88
00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:17.904
<v Speaker 3>So I pretty much grew up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born and then after that we moved </v>

89
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 3>to Tripoli in Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lived there for several years and then I</v>

90
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 3>went to Saudi Arabia where I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually until high school.</v>

91
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.133
<v Speaker 3>And then after that I went back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston again for a university and then </v>

92
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 3>came to Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why were you bouncing around so much?</v>

93
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.500
<v Speaker 3>My parents are professors and they liked</v>
<v Speaker 3>going in different places and they,</v>

94
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.473
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

95
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.090
<v Speaker 3>they got really good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Offers are both very,</v>

96
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 3>very competent and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they've traveled all over the place.</v>

97
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are just the countries we lived</v>

98
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 3>in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used to visit all over the place.</v>

99
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:54.634
<v Speaker 3>So just generally when it comes to North</v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa and the Middle East and South </v>

100
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Asia seen a lot of places growing up.</v>

101
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Well interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all three of those,</v>

102
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:03.984
<v Speaker 2>particularly Pakistan and Libya are </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably extremely different now than </v>

103
00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:09.090
<v Speaker 2>they were when you were there.</v>

104
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.900
<v Speaker 3>Olivia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have too many.</v>

105
00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:15.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's when we lived there when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a kid,</v>

106
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.870
<v Speaker 3>so I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do have strong memories of it,</v>

107
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.123
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably not representative at </v>

108
00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:21.434
<v Speaker 3>all by the way it is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in Pakistan is also very different </v>

109
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.640
<v Speaker 3>than it used to be and I haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>there for a while now.</v>

110
00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:30.200
<v Speaker 3>I can't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

111
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

112
00:05:31.441 --> 00:05:32.274
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about why you can't go there </v>

113
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:33.984
<v Speaker 2>in a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's talk about Saudi Arabia for a </v>

114
00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:36.584
<v Speaker 2>bit because it's such an important </v>
<v Speaker 2>player in world politics and its </v>

115
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:41.094
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like people actually know </v>

116
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.730
<v Speaker 2>very little about Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of our relationship.</v>

117
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.773
<v Speaker 2>What was it like growing up there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your parents as professors obviously </v>

118
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.660
<v Speaker 2>came from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming that was middle class,</v>

119
00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:56.480
<v Speaker 2>sort of educated middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

120
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 2>how did that relate to</v>

121
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 3>religion and secularism and all that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

122
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

123
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.323
<v Speaker 3>it was complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the way I describe it as my own </v>

124
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 3>nuclear family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my parents and my siblings are sort</v>

125
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 3>of a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive type of Shia Muslim family.</v>

126
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.963
<v Speaker 3>And so we had that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then outside that I was in the </v>

127
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.533
<v Speaker 3>private American school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American International School in </v>

128
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Riyadh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

129
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 3>So the school was obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was American,</v>

130
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:30.100
<v Speaker 3>so we had an American textbooks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We listen to American music and uh,</v>

131
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it wasn't,</v>

132
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.113
<v Speaker 3>it was an American school but had people</v>
<v Speaker 3>from about 80 different nationalities </v>

133
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a truly international school,</v>

134
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the,</v>

135
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of that,</v>

136
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 3>when we stepped out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

137
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cover your hair.</v>

138
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Women can't drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

139
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 3>five times prayer and if you're outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the prayer,</v>

140
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.444
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get caught by one of the baton </v>

141
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 3>was they call them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the religious police.</v>

142
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 3>So it was strange seeing all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>three things.</v>

143
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 3>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

144
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 3>when you're growing up with something as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kid that is normal for you,</v>

145
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.923
<v Speaker 3>that's what you think everything's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I actually think that it was a good </v>

146
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 3>thing to be exposed to all of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>worlds at the same time.</v>

147
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.350
<v Speaker 3>So I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

148
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

149
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:20.100
<v Speaker 3>when nine slash 11 happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

150
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.940
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

151
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.773
<v Speaker 3>the Saudis coming in from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember the mentality that there </v>

152
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:25.574
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one thing I described in my </v>

153
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:28.094
<v Speaker 3>book is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in fifth grade at the </v>

154
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:30.674
<v Speaker 3>American school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd made paper snowflakes out of you </v>

155
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.730
<v Speaker 3>fold up a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cut snowflakes and we decorated them</v>

156
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 3>with glue and glitter and our names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we were happy,</v>

157
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 3>I was about 10 years old and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

158
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:46.124
<v Speaker 3>even though it was an American school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Saudi Ministry of Education used to </v>

159
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:54.701
<v Speaker 3>send an inspector once in a while to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure everything's okay,</v>

160
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 3>everything's going according to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules.</v>

161
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 3>And he came in and he actually cut the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tips off of each of the snowflakes,</v>

162
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 3>was very angry and cut them off and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>asked our teacher what was going on so I</v>

163
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:08.324
<v Speaker 3>can know what is this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she told us about the Star of </v>

164
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.770
<v Speaker 3>David and why we can everything that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>six points that sort of symbolizes that.</v>

165
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.050
<v Speaker 3>And that was our whole class of 10 year </v>
<v Speaker 3>olds.</v>

166
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 3>That was our introduction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least my introduction to the Jews.</v>

167
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.301
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

168
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:24.134
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was just a spot check from an </v>

169
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:29.890
<v Speaker 3>inspector,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their kids,</v>

170
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to will go to the Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools.</v>

171
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.593
<v Speaker 3>They have the stuff in their textbooks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy who did that spot check for us </v>

172
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.063
<v Speaker 3>was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually writes the curriculum for </v>

173
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 3>the rest of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when nine slash 11 happened and I saw</v>

174
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:43.394
<v Speaker 3>that kind of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people coming in from there and </v>

175
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:49.020
<v Speaker 3>then the people in my school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Americans,</v>

176
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.390
<v Speaker 3>they're the ones being attacked over </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

177
00:08:51.391 --> 00:08:52.224
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really strange seeing it because </v>

178
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 3>I've kind of grown up with both sides in</v>
<v Speaker 3>parallel,</v>

179
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.003
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

180
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.963
<v Speaker 3>and all my teachers were American and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of my friends were from the US and </v>

181
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

182
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 3>the company I was living in was a place </v>
<v Speaker 3>while the hijackers came from.</v>

183
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 2>So at fifth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're probably,</v>

184
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's about 11 years old or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

185
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.420
<v Speaker 2>was that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were your secular awakening?</v>

186
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was happening,</v>

187
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 2>is that the time of that or how </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious was your family?</v>

188
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:21.234
<v Speaker 2>Were you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were you guys away from it already or </v>

189
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.653
<v Speaker 2>break that down for me?</v>

190
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my family was,</v>

191
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.850
<v Speaker 3>my family was sort of liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious.</v>

192
00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were Muslim,</v>

193
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.510
<v Speaker 3>they were believing Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We used to go through the,</v>

194
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did the Ramadan thing.</v>

195
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 3>We used to go where she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we to do tomorrow morning.</v>

196
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my parents used to prey on and off,</v>

197
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 3>but usually they made it to like two or </v>
<v Speaker 3>three times a day on average.</v>

198
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.281
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

199
00:09:45.281 --> 00:09:45.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

200
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:46.683
<v Speaker 2>there must be an interesting diagram of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people praying and then the sort of </v>

201
00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:51.070
<v Speaker 2>dropoff as it gets later in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

202
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.801
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

203
00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:53.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them Muslims,</v>

204
00:09:53.741 --> 00:09:55.810
<v Speaker 3>you actually believe pray five times a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

205
00:09:55.811 --> 00:09:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Every time I watch TV and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

206
00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a slight tangent,</v>

207
00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:02.110
<v Speaker 3>but every time you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you google,</v>

208
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.090
<v Speaker 3>North American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim or American Muslim,</v>

209
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.200
<v Speaker 3>you'll get a whole picture of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>with head scarves and you know,</v>

210
00:10:08.201 --> 00:10:11.470
<v Speaker 3>people in mosques and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're just,</v>

211
00:10:11.471 --> 00:10:15.240
<v Speaker 3>as a representative of us Muslims is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

212
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.360
<v Speaker 3>any modes and group care and Islam or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

213
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.813
<v Speaker 2>what is exactly why we should all be </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to people like you more because </v>

214
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 2>I have no faith that the media is giving</v>
<v Speaker 2>us examples of any,</v>

215
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:28.560
<v Speaker 2>forget religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity,</v>

216
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:29.394
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The media gives us such bad examples of </v>

217
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 2>everybody that that's why we have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to the outliers.</v>

218
00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

219
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.230
<v Speaker 3>And you understand it in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sorry we're going away from your</v>

220
00:10:38.231 --> 00:10:39.220
<v Speaker 3>original question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

221
00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:40.370
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

222
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.400
<v Speaker 3>I understand it in a way because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

223
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:43.870
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's something,</v>

224
00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:44.704
<v Speaker 3>some story relating to Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not exactly going to call it </v>

225
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.950
<v Speaker 3>pastor or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who's a was a,</v>

226
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.470
<v Speaker 3>a priest or something like that is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>expert in Christianity.</v>

227
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.210
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing with Muslims as it's different</v>

228
00:10:58.211 --> 00:11:00.100
<v Speaker 3>when you think Jerry Seinfeld with David</v>
<v Speaker 3>Letterman,</v>

229
00:11:00.101 --> 00:11:02.900
<v Speaker 3>you don't think jus right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with right,</v>

230
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.510
<v Speaker 2>well I don't think letterman's Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think either way</v>

231
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.840
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was a comedian so it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>close enough.</v>

232
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.210
<v Speaker 3>Comedian is a whole different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a separate.</v>

233
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.320
<v Speaker 3>I think that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

234
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.253
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

235
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.480
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to Muslims,</v>

236
00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:19.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean Dave Chappelle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Oz,</v>

237
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Shaq o'neal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all of these guys.</v>

238
00:11:21.471 --> 00:11:26.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are people who are Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not who you say that,</v>

239
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:27.803
<v Speaker 3>that's not the representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though they're right here in front </v>

240
00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:30.250
<v Speaker 3>of our faces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when,</v>

241
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 3>when you see it on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always the one with the headscarf.</v>

242
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost every non Muslim I know who works</v>

243
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:38.310
<v Speaker 3>with the Muslim of work has gone for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>beer with them afterwards.</v>

244
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.403
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people have dated Muslim girls </v>

245
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 3>and they've very few of them actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>wear the headscarf.</v>

246
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:44.540
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

247
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

248
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.370
<v Speaker 2>if Shaq was the main representative for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim,</v>

249
00:11:49.371 --> 00:11:51.320
<v Speaker 2>things would be extremely different </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

250
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably probably for the better.</v>

251
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

252
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 2>so tell me a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your family.</v>

253
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 2>So you guys were sort of religious but </v>
<v Speaker 2>not that religious.</v>

254
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.533
<v Speaker 2>You were getting some of this at school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was obviously Americanized a </v>

255
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.120
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

256
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.680
<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

257
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.390
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my main,</v>

258
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.590
<v Speaker 3>the first time is truly skeptical of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that religion.</v>

259
00:12:12.591 --> 00:12:13.424
<v Speaker 3>And God was when I was five years old </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I actually had a cousin and she was </v>

260
00:12:17.391 --> 00:12:22.391
<v Speaker 3>three and this is said that she lived in</v>
<v Speaker 3>London and she had childhood leukemia.</v>

261
00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:23.130
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

262
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.530
<v Speaker 3>she was close to my age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was five.</v>

263
00:12:24.531 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 3>She was three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

264
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.750
<v Speaker 3>we were playmates and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she was dying,</v>

265
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.750
<v Speaker 3>everybody who came into the room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this was like an art in the culture,</v>

266
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:33.584
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last moments every once in those kids </v>

267
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.590
<v Speaker 3>where they're there and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know what a child's death,</v>

268
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.200
<v Speaker 3>especially from cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely horrific.</v>

269
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.463
<v Speaker 3>So cancer doesn't discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same amount of pain and adult fields is </v>

270
00:12:45.891 --> 00:12:46.724
<v Speaker 3>what a three year old child would feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So print at that time there wasn't </v>

271
00:12:50.031 --> 00:12:54.590
<v Speaker 3>really any good cure for childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>acute lymphoblastic leukemia either.</v>

272
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:55.723
<v Speaker 3>So at that point my mother and my aunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>were praying and crying and I was </v>

273
00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:03.020
<v Speaker 3>standing there with my father and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>asked my father,</v>

274
00:13:03.021 --> 00:13:03.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

275
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.333
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was watching her in pain and he </v>

276
00:13:06.531 --> 00:13:09.180
<v Speaker 3>said that God's taking her back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

277
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.500
<v Speaker 3>God's taking her to a better place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping her with him.</v>

278
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.150
<v Speaker 3>So I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

279
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.033
<v Speaker 3>that's not such a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why are they crying and why they </v>

280
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.930
<v Speaker 3>praying so hard and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

281
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:21.170
<v Speaker 3>they're begging God not to take her </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

282
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.480
<v Speaker 3>They want him to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

283
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.353
<v Speaker 3>like stop the pain or not take away and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me like in my mind we used to play </v>

284
00:13:28.071 --> 00:13:31.580
<v Speaker 3>tug of war at school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was thinking of the tug of war game</v>

285
00:13:31.581 --> 00:13:32.414
<v Speaker 3>where there's this God who's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful apparently and we're on the </v>

286
00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:35.714
<v Speaker 3>other end and we're pulling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just seemed like a very sadistic </v>

287
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.573
<v Speaker 3>thing to do.</v>

288
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.473
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also sounds like such a losing </v>

289
00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:47.740
<v Speaker 2>proposition if you're the believer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if in this case your,</v>

290
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.630
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your father,</v>

291
00:13:48.631 --> 00:13:49.464
<v Speaker 2>assuming he was a believer or or that </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he was just playing the role as a </v>

292
00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:52.764
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a losing proposition if you </v>

293
00:13:54.451 --> 00:13:55.284
<v Speaker 2>pretty much know medically that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>child is not going to make it and yet </v>

294
00:13:58.921 --> 00:13:59.754
<v Speaker 2>you have these people praying and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know the outcome is pretty much in </v>

295
00:14:03.631 --> 00:14:04.464
<v Speaker 2>front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you actually saying about </v>

296
00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:07.770
<v Speaker 2>prayer is also an interesting angle.</v>

297
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:08.803
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that if the of God is all </v>

298
00:14:10.701 --> 00:14:12.620
<v Speaker 3>powerful and there's a three year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid in pain,</v>

299
00:14:12.621 --> 00:14:14.660
<v Speaker 3>you don't find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>

300
00:14:14.661 --> 00:14:16.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to take the kid back then don't</v>

301
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:17.613
<v Speaker 3>like don't draw it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't drop the agony cause of cancer </v>

302
00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:22.160
<v Speaker 3>deaths are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

303
00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that point that the clarity of a five</v>

304
00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:26.224
<v Speaker 3>year old mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I obviously that I remember this very </v>

305
00:14:27.651 --> 00:14:28.484
<v Speaker 3>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my earliest strongest </v>

306
00:14:29.811 --> 00:14:31.820
<v Speaker 3>memories just because of the intensity </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

307
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.980
<v Speaker 3>And after that I thought it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

308
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.460
<v Speaker 3>nobody's really going to be happy with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this God character anymore,</v>

309
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.180
<v Speaker 3>but the next week or every ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything got was a hero.</v>

310
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone who's continued praying to him.</v>

311
00:14:43.521 --> 00:14:47.190
<v Speaker 3>So it didn't make a lot of sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after that I thought I was like</v>

312
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.230
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well all these guys,</v>

313
00:14:48.231 --> 00:14:49.064
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the adults grown ups think it makes </v>

314
00:14:49.911 --> 00:14:50.200
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

315
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.033
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe I'm the WHO's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I'd see I'd watched TV and </v>

316
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.790
<v Speaker 3>there'd be a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural disaster,</v>

317
00:14:56.791 --> 00:15:01.791
<v Speaker 3>a tornado or a flood or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the lone survivor or two would say,</v>

318
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm God bless.</v>

319
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.240
<v Speaker 3>God saved me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so thankful to God knows.</v>

320
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I'd always think know what did the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do,</v>

321
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.773
<v Speaker 3>so as a kid it was always there and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dabbled in and out of being religious </v>

322
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:19.410
<v Speaker 3>to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whenever had exams final.</v>

323
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.940
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

324
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.130
<v Speaker 3>that's where the prayer would kick in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

325
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.003
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like my cousin used to call the </v>

326
00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:28.400
<v Speaker 3>bing God reviving God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a very religious guy.</v>

327
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.513
<v Speaker 2>God probably took your brides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing you were pretty good </v>

328
00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:32.790
<v Speaker 2>student.</v>

329
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turned out that I was fairly.</v>

330
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did well in school.</v>

331
00:15:37.091 --> 00:15:40.090
<v Speaker 3>Like I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned out whether I prayed or not.</v>

332
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.983
<v Speaker 3>God somehow was okay with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But all those kids with HIV in Africa </v>

333
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.140
<v Speaker 3>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

334
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:51.150
<v Speaker 3>just somehow my grades were okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But HIV for the kids in Africa,</v>

335
00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:52.853
<v Speaker 3>not so much.</v>

336
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.071
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

337
00:15:54.071 --> 00:15:57.070
<v Speaker 2>you have this awakening and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's happening now where,</v>

338
00:15:57.071 --> 00:15:57.904
<v Speaker 2>where was the full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of more adult version of your </v>

339
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:01.544
<v Speaker 2>awakening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you still in Saudi Arabia or was </v>

340
00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:03.420
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

341
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 2>when you had left already?</v>

342
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:05.670
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>

343
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.340
<v Speaker 3>I had left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had gone,</v>

344
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 3>gone to medical school at that point in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan.</v>

345
00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:12.200
<v Speaker 3>I finished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd completed it,</v>

346
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.710
<v Speaker 3>and towards the end of it I had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually really started reading.</v>

347
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

348
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.443
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'd started reading the Scripture </v>

349
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:24.110
<v Speaker 3>and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Koran when I was much younger,</v>

350
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.970
<v Speaker 3>but I think when the internet came </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and I wanted to do more research,</v>

351
00:16:28.971 --> 00:16:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I was able to find more things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was around 99 or something.</v>

352
00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:35.820
<v Speaker 3>I was already in my twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

353
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

354
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.820
<v Speaker 3>So I started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

355
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I actually started reading it,</v>

356
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.240
<v Speaker 3>then when people got more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>defensive about it,</v>

357
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.800
<v Speaker 3>the more I talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in practice,</v>

358
00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:49.070
<v Speaker 3>then when you talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give you all of these responses.</v>

359
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:49.941
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

360
00:16:49.941 --> 00:16:51.500
<v Speaker 3>those aren't true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslims are,</v>

361
00:16:51.501 --> 00:16:52.334
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is sort of a bit of peace or that </v>

362
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.183
<v Speaker 3>thing that you're recording from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime that's mistranslated or </v>

363
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.480
<v Speaker 3>misinterpreted or it's a metaphor or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the excuse was gonna.</v>

364
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Eventually it started seeing through it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I think it was actually one day</v>

365
00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:07.280
<v Speaker 3>when it hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

366
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.410
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have given considering this.</v>

367
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:12.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy lived inside a fish.</v>

368
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.353
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

369
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:18.730
<v Speaker 3>it says it says in its.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd hear that in the Koran.</v>

370
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.470
<v Speaker 3>For me it was a karate for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

371
00:17:21.471 --> 00:17:22.580
<v Speaker 3>It's a bible and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

372
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.183
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should note that they're all equally </v>

373
00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:26.194
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of evil stuff and all of </v>

374
00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.190
<v Speaker 2>them we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.810
<v Speaker 2>we want to be good liberals here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's not pile on one right.</v>

376
00:17:31.811 --> 00:17:35.110
<v Speaker 2>There is plenty of awful stuff in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Old Testament.</v>

377
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

378
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.290
<v Speaker 3>They always say that if Moses hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinated up the Old Testament,</v>

379
00:17:40.291 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muhammad couldn't have plagiarized it.</v>

380
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.550
<v Speaker 3>It is an and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>similarities as a no pork.</v>

381
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 3>There's no for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for miles,</v>

382
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.843
<v Speaker 4>there's a Shalom and Salaam and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>both of their nicknames are mow it in a </v>

383
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:56.740
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

384
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of similarities between,</v>

385
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 4>especially between Judaism and Islam and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the violence and the books.</v>

386
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a,</v>

387
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.340
<v Speaker 4>that's an obvious thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I used to think of like,</v>

388
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.300
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing when people would </v>
<v Speaker 4>quote a 4:34</v>

389
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:10.134
<v Speaker 4>which says that you can beat your wife </v>
<v Speaker 4>if your disobedience as a last resort </v>

390
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.620
<v Speaker 4>and they justify it now like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well no,</v>

391
00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 4>it actually means this or it's only as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>last resort.</v>

392
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:19.950
<v Speaker 4>And I used to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

393
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.400
<v Speaker 4>if I had written this in my book and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>book came out last week,</v>

394
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.113
<v Speaker 4>you guys would be killing me for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's the word you wouldn't be </v>

395
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:30.564
<v Speaker 4>looking for context.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't be looking at alternative </v>

396
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:32.814
<v Speaker 4>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a luxury that we only afford two </v>

397
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.060
<v Speaker 4>holy books and we don't read Alice in </v>
<v Speaker 4>wonderland that way.</v>

398
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.100
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the and the,</v>

399
00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like,</v>

400
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.330
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reza and so on will be like,</v>

401
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.650
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

402
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:47.813
<v Speaker 4>we should not read this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally like the worst thing is that </v>

403
00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Speaker 4>people will read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally.</v>

404
00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:52.920
<v Speaker 4>I was actually on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a show.</v>

405
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:53.754
<v Speaker 4>I was on the agenda with Steve here in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Toronto and I was sitting next to </v>

406
00:18:57.811 --> 00:18:59.970
<v Speaker 4>Shabbir Ali,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who who's an Islamic scholar,</v>

407
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.310
<v Speaker 4>and at one point he actually said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

408
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people misquote the Koran by quoting it.</v>

409
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just thinking that that was one of</v>

410
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:10.770
<v Speaker 4>the most amazing sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's a great quote right there.</v>

411
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.950
<v Speaker 4>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he said it and I used to think,</v>

412
00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:16.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand why they're so terrified of</v>

413
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:18.500
<v Speaker 4>people quoting it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally any script,</v>

414
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.390
<v Speaker 4>because it's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could,</v>

415
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:25.230
<v Speaker 4>if you quote those words exactly the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're written are exactly the way</v>

416
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:28.130
<v Speaker 4>they were said by God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently a,</v>

417
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.560
<v Speaker 4>then it's a terrifying thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

418
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.570
<v Speaker 4>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

419
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.423
<v Speaker 4>you have to look at the interpreters and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the scholars and then you listen to the </v>

420
00:19:36.211 --> 00:19:38.220
<v Speaker 4>scholars and they're saying these human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings,</v>

421
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:39.054
<v Speaker 4>their explanations of what's God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when God's word is actually means more </v>

422
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:48.120
<v Speaker 4>than what God's word is itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which again doesn't make any sense,</v>

423
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:51.670
<v Speaker 4>and Isis and al Qaeda and the Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

424
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.120
<v Speaker 4>these are these people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not quoting scholars.</v>

425
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're quoting scripture.</v>

426
00:19:56.121 --> 00:19:57.540
<v Speaker 4>And recording the deed.</v>

427
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

428
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.880
<v Speaker 2>after the Paris attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got into it on twitter with one of my,</v>

429
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.790
<v Speaker 2>one of my friends on the left who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately was,</v>

430
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:07.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with within wild the thing I think while</v>

431
00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:08.634
<v Speaker 2>the event was still happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so literally they hadn't caught anybody </v>

432
00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:11.844
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were bodies still on the </v>

433
00:20:12.721 --> 00:20:13.554
<v Speaker 2>floor at the theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He immediately went to the American </v>

434
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.273
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy stuff and then a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes after that they released the </v>

435
00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:23.310
<v Speaker 2>guys who did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isis actually released the statement and</v>

436
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 2>there was a ton of scripture in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

437
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:27.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about this?</v>

438
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 2>And then the conversation sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dwindled off into nothing and I.</v>

439
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.860
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's part of what this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole schism here on the left that we've</v>

440
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:37.560
<v Speaker 2>been talking so much about is related </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

441
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's scripture,</v>

442
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:43.080
<v Speaker 2>it's written word that somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 2>believing and taking into action.</v>

443
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.230
<v Speaker 2>And then also there's a lot of messed up</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy stuff by every country in</v>

444
00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:47.570
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

445
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

446
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.420
<v Speaker 2>always find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it interesting that whenever I'm,</v>

447
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm debating or I'm having a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>with anybody,</v>

448
00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:53.623
<v Speaker 2>usually if it's someone who is moderate </v>
<v Speaker 2>or someone or an academic or someone </v>

449
00:20:57.741 --> 00:20:58.574
<v Speaker 2>else in Islamic studies for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to talk about the </v>

450
00:21:01.041 --> 00:21:01.940
<v Speaker 2>scripture and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

451
00:21:01.941 --> 00:21:02.774
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just not talk about the scripture </v>

452
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.850
<v Speaker 2>as if it's sort of beneath them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

453
00:21:04.851 --> 00:21:05.684
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to talk about the social </v>

454
00:21:06.651 --> 00:21:08.030
<v Speaker 2>logical implications with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

455
00:21:08.031 --> 00:21:08.864
<v Speaker 2>how does religion workout is ideal </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity formation and all of these </v>

456
00:21:11.301 --> 00:21:12.830
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economics and so on.</v>

457
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.920
<v Speaker 2>But whenever I talked to a guy with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beard,</v>

458
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's more of a fundamentalist </v>

459
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.910
<v Speaker 2>and I like at times I'll sit and I said </v>
<v Speaker 2>this on the show to Shabbir Ali too.</v>

460
00:21:22.911 --> 00:21:23.271
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

461
00:21:23.271 --> 00:21:24.830
<v Speaker 2>let's not get into the whole scripture </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

462
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.090
<v Speaker 2>but they almost always turned around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

463
00:21:27.091 --> 00:21:28.400
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's important.</v>

464
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.640
<v Speaker 2>That's what religion is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the people who are actually believing</v>

465
00:21:34.011 --> 00:21:39.011
<v Speaker 2>it and going along with the tenants of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and actually following the example of</v>

466
00:21:40.611 --> 00:21:41.444
<v Speaker 2>the prophet and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are people who actually take </v>

467
00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:46.430
<v Speaker 2>scripture very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very seriously at the rest of the people</v>

468
00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.293
<v Speaker 2>don't and I think it's because there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>an element of rationality and then they </v>

469
00:21:51.501 --> 00:21:52.580
<v Speaker 2>just can't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

470
00:21:52.581 --> 00:21:53.420
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a book,</v>

471
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.980
<v Speaker 2>but nobody really believes this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

472
00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:58.200
<v Speaker 2>So last week my guest is Peter </v>
<v Speaker 2>Boghossian,</v>

473
00:21:58.201 --> 00:21:59.034
<v Speaker 2>who you're probably familiar with and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a book called a manual for </v>

474
00:22:02.761 --> 00:22:03.594
<v Speaker 2>creating atheists and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I thought was most interesting </v>

475
00:22:05.551 --> 00:22:07.840
<v Speaker 2>about it was that he basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

476
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.693
<v Speaker 2>because these beliefs are not based in </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical thinking or rationality and </v>

477
00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:13.284
<v Speaker 2>that people have to take this leap of </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith that actually if you can really </v>

478
00:22:16.561 --> 00:22:19.910
<v Speaker 2>sit someone down and you do it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the right intent and,</v>

479
00:22:19.911 --> 00:22:23.200
<v Speaker 2>and a clear mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can start pulling the,</v>

480
00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.053
<v Speaker 2>the underpinnings away in an effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and you can actually convert people </v>

481
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.640
<v Speaker 2>into free thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

482
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna Guess that you've done quite a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of that yourself.</v>

483
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.540
<v Speaker 4>The only reason I do what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dave,</v>

484
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.380
<v Speaker 4>is because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anytime somebody tells me,</v>

485
00:22:40.381 --> 00:22:42.090
<v Speaker 4>it's like another way that you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

486
00:22:42.091 --> 00:22:42.924
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people aren't going to change their </v>

487
00:22:43.981 --> 00:22:47.400
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is absolutely not true.</v>

488
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.070
<v Speaker 4>And I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

489
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

490
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.740
<v Speaker 4>if you look at my inbox,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my email inbox,</v>

491
00:22:52.741 --> 00:22:55.110
<v Speaker 4>like almost on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

492
00:22:55.111 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 4>I get messages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the most recent one was not,</v>

493
00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:58.643
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you read that post at </v>
<v Speaker 4>one fire arrows by a friend of mine see </v>

494
00:23:00.301 --> 00:23:01.134
<v Speaker 4>me Ramond and she wrote about the dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling the difference between a </v>

495
00:23:03.541 --> 00:23:05.430
<v Speaker 4>moderate and radical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She lives in California.</v>

496
00:23:05.431 --> 00:23:07.140
<v Speaker 4>She's a pediatrician.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

497
00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:07.771
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

498
00:23:07.771 --> 00:23:08.680
<v Speaker 4>I'll send it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

499
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.110
<v Speaker 4>please do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

500
00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:11.160
<v Speaker 4>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

501
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.473
<v Speaker 4>so it went viral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got thousands and thousands of shares </v>

502
00:23:14.341 --> 00:23:15.174
<v Speaker 4>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she got a message just a few days </v>

503
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.630
<v Speaker 4>ago and there was this a woman who </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually wore than the cop.</v>

504
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.690
<v Speaker 4>It was a very conservative family and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she'd read it.</v>

505
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.093
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she has now she's seriously thinking </v>

506
00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:30.474
<v Speaker 4>about taking it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was completely shaken the way </v>

507
00:23:32.371 --> 00:23:34.860
<v Speaker 4>that she's thinking about things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that she grew up.</v>

508
00:23:34.861 --> 00:23:35.694
<v Speaker 4>And these are stories that I hear </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyday and I hear them more than ever </v>

509
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.180
<v Speaker 4>in Muslim majority countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

510
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.473
<v Speaker 4>and this is what's so interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in North America generally lead to </v>

511
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 4>the Muslims because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're used to,</v>

512
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.083
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the free speech and the open discourse </v>

513
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:53.520
<v Speaker 4>and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

514
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 4>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they like to have a respectful approach.</v>

515
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:56.841
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

516
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:59.390
<v Speaker 4>criticize religion to be respectful of </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

517
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:01.910
<v Speaker 4>They don't like the tone that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

518
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.773
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Richard Dawkins or Bill Maher </v>

519
00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.050
<v Speaker 4>takes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

520
00:24:06.051 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 4>in the Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in these Muslim majority countries where</v>

521
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 4>they're living under these sorts of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>theocratic dictatorships,</v>

522
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:14.480
<v Speaker 4>even though they're not officially a </v>
<v Speaker 4>theocratic dictatorships,</v>

523
00:24:14.481 --> 00:24:16.030
<v Speaker 4>almost all of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

524
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 4>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

525
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.673
<v Speaker 4>that really resonates for them with them</v>
<v Speaker 4>to eat with a more aggressive tone </v>

526
00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:23.930
<v Speaker 4>because they're oppressed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't speak.</v>

527
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 4>So they're angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're frustrated.</v>

528
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.343
<v Speaker 4>The last person that they heard who </v>
<v Speaker 4>spoke went out and he got hacked to </v>

529
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:32.500
<v Speaker 4>death and in Daca.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

530
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.140
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

531
00:24:34.141 --> 00:24:36.650
<v Speaker 4>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're angry and they're frustrated and</v>

532
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.240
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want that kind of talent.</v>

533
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.083
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel like the respectful discourse </v>

534
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:45.910
<v Speaker 4>is the luxury of the privileged people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are able to have values like freedom</v>

535
00:24:46.071 --> 00:24:46.904
<v Speaker 4>of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then we can take that who take that </v>

536
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:48.644
<v Speaker 4>for granted.</v>

537
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.880
<v Speaker 2>That's really fascinating because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

538
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I've talked a lot about how people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

539
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:57.380
<v Speaker 2>especially it's Dawkins and Mara are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>two that have sort of become,</v>

540
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most outspoken on atheism really.</v>

541
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talking about the doctrine of Islam,</v>

542
00:25:03.651 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I think they're pretty both pretty clear</v>

543
00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.830
<v Speaker 4>that's out there in the Muslim majority </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries.</v>

544
00:25:07.831 --> 00:25:08.230
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

545
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I think,</v>

546
00:25:09.611 --> 00:25:13.450
<v Speaker 2>what I think is interesting here is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear from atheists will say,</v>

547
00:25:13.451 --> 00:25:14.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dawkins,</v>

548
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Mr they're there to offense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

549
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.310
<v Speaker 2>it's too offensive there'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.970
<v Speaker 2>they're putting out too much and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not speaking in a friendly way.</v>

551
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.510
<v Speaker 2>So atheist or angry at them for being </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>

552
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.100
<v Speaker 2>But interestingly you're saying that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign places in foreign countries,</v>

553
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.670
<v Speaker 2>they need to hear it in that light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's incredible.</v>

554
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.173
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they actually want to say it </v>

555
00:25:35.971 --> 00:25:36.541
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

556
00:25:36.541 --> 00:25:37.740
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most,</v>

557
00:25:37.741 --> 00:25:38.574
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of aggressive sounding atheists </v>

558
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.570
<v Speaker 4>that you'll meet from the Muslim world </v>
<v Speaker 4>are the ones who actually grew up.</v>

559
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.423
<v Speaker 4>They're the ones with the accents are </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ones who made it here after living </v>

560
00:25:49.351 --> 00:25:50.184
<v Speaker 4>there who think that all Americans kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of take freedom of speech and polite </v>

561
00:25:52.771 --> 00:25:55.250
<v Speaker 4>discourse and so on for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

562
00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:57.450
<v Speaker 4>they are angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want a more angry sort of,</v>

563
00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

564
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.840
<v Speaker 4>expression of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there,</v>

565
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a point,</v>

566
00:26:01.951 --> 00:26:02.784
<v Speaker 4>I do understand why people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different things work on different </v>

567
00:26:05.761 --> 00:26:06.594
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always give the example of the civil </v>

568
00:26:07.321 --> 00:26:08.131
<v Speaker 4>rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

569
00:26:08.131 --> 00:26:10.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rosa parks acted in silence,</v>

570
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was sitting on the,</v>

571
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.220
<v Speaker 4>on the bus and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to move back.</v>

572
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.533
<v Speaker 4>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Martin Luther King was the diplomat </v>

573
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:18.750
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he was,</v>

574
00:26:18.751 --> 00:26:21.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was sort of more political.</v>

575
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.300
<v Speaker 4>He was conciliatory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>used to try to make a reasoned arguments</v>

576
00:26:24.301 --> 00:26:26.160
<v Speaker 4>and talk to the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the other hand,</v>

577
00:26:26.161 --> 00:26:31.161
<v Speaker 4>you had malcolm x who was a more </v>
<v Speaker 4>militant and all of those approaches had</v>

578
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.520
<v Speaker 4>had a role that a very key role in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they work on different people.</v>

579
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.330
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my approach is probably more sort of,</v>

580
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

581
00:26:40.741 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 4>I tried to be reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I reasonable arguments.</v>

582
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:46.240
<v Speaker 4>I try to do that at least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

583
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.123
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do appreciate people who do the kind </v>

584
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:51.114
<v Speaker 4>of thing that Bill Maher and Richard </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dawkins soon because I know that it </v>

585
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.910
<v Speaker 4>resonates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that it's a,</v>

586
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:57.283
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very satisfying to a lot of </v>

587
00:26:58.681 --> 00:26:59.514
<v Speaker 4>people growing up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember when I was growing up </v>

588
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:01.944
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever I would hear people say things </v>

589
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was George Carlin at the time,</v>

590
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:07.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

591
00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.253
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember seeing little things that </v>

592
00:27:09.751 --> 00:27:13.680
<v Speaker 4>George Carlin had done and the way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he talked about religion,</v>

593
00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:18.681
<v Speaker 4>it was just so in your face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so like nakedly open some of it that</v>

594
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.993
<v Speaker 4>it was extremely satisfying to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's something that you could not </v>

595
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.590
<v Speaker 4>see and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'd,</v>

596
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:25.423
<v Speaker 4>you'd show it to your friends is on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>vhs tape and show to your friends and </v>

597
00:27:27.721 --> 00:27:28.554
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little clip where you said it and you </v>

598
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:35.250
<v Speaker 4>see the shock on their faces and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was something really satisfying about</v>

599
00:27:35.251 --> 00:27:35.480
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

600
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

601
00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell my friend,</v>

602
00:27:37.011 --> 00:27:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Kelly Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has been on the show,</v>

603
00:27:38.331 --> 00:27:39.164
<v Speaker 2>who is George's daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell Kelly literally once a week I'll </v>

604
00:27:42.741 --> 00:27:44.810
<v Speaker 2>call her or text her and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

605
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:46.071
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ironically,</v>

606
00:27:46.071 --> 00:27:46.671
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>

607
00:27:46.671 --> 00:27:47.504
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wish that your dad was around </v>

608
00:27:49.251 --> 00:27:50.084
<v Speaker 2>now because we're so trapped and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will get us to the next portion of </v>

609
00:27:53.601 --> 00:27:54.434
<v Speaker 2>this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're so trapped in this pc world </v>

610
00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:57.374
<v Speaker 2>right now and we're so afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>language and we're so afraid of </v>

611
00:27:59.571 --> 00:28:02.000
<v Speaker 2>offending everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And already,</v>

612
00:28:02.001 --> 00:28:02.834
<v Speaker 2>as you've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you have to offend people to </v>

613
00:28:05.541 --> 00:28:08.240
<v Speaker 2>actually break through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not your style clearly.</v>

614
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.103
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not looking to offend </v>

615
00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:11.144
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

616
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.070
<v Speaker 4>but ended up doing it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the nature of the.</v>

617
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.090
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing is,</v>

618
00:28:17.091 --> 00:28:19.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear this a lot,</v>

619
00:28:19.761 --> 00:28:24.761
<v Speaker 4>I hear a lot of people say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially a lot of my Muslim friends in</v>

620
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.843
<v Speaker 4>here living in the US and in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the free freedom of speech does </v>

621
00:28:30.351 --> 00:28:33.500
<v Speaker 4>not mean the freedom of to offend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I always say to them,</v>

622
00:28:33.501 --> 00:28:34.334
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no such thing as freedom of </v>

623
00:28:35.691 --> 00:28:38.050
<v Speaker 4>speech without the freedom and offend </v>
<v Speaker 4>every.</v>

624
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:38.983
<v Speaker 4>There is absolutely no major </v>
<v Speaker 4>revolutionary change that has ever </v>

625
00:28:41.661 --> 00:28:44.240
<v Speaker 4>happened in history that did not piss </v>
<v Speaker 4>off a lot of people.</v>

626
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:48.800
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk a little bit about our </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends on the left because,</v>

627
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:49.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they've,</v>

628
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:50.763
<v Speaker 2>they failed us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but particularly you and your friends </v>

629
00:28:54.861 --> 00:28:57.020
<v Speaker 2>and family probably in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this regard,</v>

630
00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:57.883
<v Speaker 2>they have somehow align themselves with </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces that don't want you to speak up </v>

631
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.370
<v Speaker 2>against doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

632
00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:05.204
<v Speaker 2>and that's really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the reverse of liberalism and I'll </v>

633
00:29:07.701 --> 00:29:08.534
<v Speaker 2>let you take it from there.</v>

634
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

635
00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.740
<v Speaker 4>that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if you're against bad ideas,</v>

636
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.460
<v Speaker 4>bad ideas anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you oppose homophobia,</v>

637
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.700
<v Speaker 4>homophobia is a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be a bad thing.</v>

638
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.750
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

639
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:24.070
<v Speaker 4>you pointed out every time it's someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>caused the Bible or every time it's in a</v>

640
00:29:24.071 --> 00:29:25.820
<v Speaker 4>donald trump's speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

641
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or to Ted Cruz speech or whatever it is,</v>

642
00:29:28.151 --> 00:29:33.151
<v Speaker 4>then that's team idea is also a bad idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's in the Koran and if it's being</v>

643
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.880
<v Speaker 4>said by Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including a lot of liberal Muslims,</v>

644
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.963
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is something that even a lot of </v>

645
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 4>liberal Muslims in North America haven't</v>
<v Speaker 4>warmed up to yet.</v>

646
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.210
<v Speaker 4>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

647
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.753
<v Speaker 4>I understand like there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a certain instinct to </v>

648
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.270
<v Speaker 4>try and protect the minority,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

649
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 4>but the ideology that the minority here </v>
<v Speaker 4>subscribes to just coincidentally,</v>

650
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:55.384
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not saying that they follow it </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same way that they do in other more </v>

651
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:01.060
<v Speaker 4>violent parts of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that same ideology,</v>

652
00:30:01.061 --> 00:30:05.500
<v Speaker 4>the same book is being used to kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

653
00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

654
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:10.570
<v Speaker 4>And to throw gay people off rooftops in </v>
<v Speaker 4>other parts of the world.</v>

655
00:30:10.571 --> 00:30:11.404
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is very confusing for everybody </v>

656
00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:15.094
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that it happens is people see </v>

657
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially non Muslims,</v>

658
00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:21.064
<v Speaker 4>they see on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they see a group called the Islamic </v>

659
00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:24.304
<v Speaker 4>state quoting the Koran accurately and </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually seeing quoting verses that say </v>

660
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:31.540
<v Speaker 4>fight the disbelievers and charge them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

661
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:34.750
<v Speaker 4>at the Non Muslim tax and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God will destroy them and so on.</v>

662
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.400
<v Speaker 4>So they're quoting these verses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're saying a lot whopper,</v>

663
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.753
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're,</v>

664
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.133
<v Speaker 4>they're obviously professing their faith</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they're chopping someone's </v>

665
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:46.030
<v Speaker 4>heads off or throwing somebody off a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rooftop.</v>

666
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.733
<v Speaker 4>And the reaction over here often when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they see that is that they immediately </v>

667
00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:54.710
<v Speaker 4>jumped in defending the faith that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the real faith.</v>

668
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.210
<v Speaker 4>And the moment they say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

669
00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.200
<v Speaker 4>do bring the scripture to them.</v>

670
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.430
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what about this verse?</v>

671
00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:01.930
<v Speaker 4>They quote just like you did with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend,</v>

672
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about this versus that?</v>

673
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:06.490
<v Speaker 4>They quoted this to says exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 4>words that they said here,</v>

674
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.810
<v Speaker 4>match the action,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they start defending the verses</v>

675
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.890
<v Speaker 4>and the book a misinterpretation out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>context.</v>

676
00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:16.140
<v Speaker 4>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the,</v>

677
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.033
<v Speaker 4>you know that sort of the excuses that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're here and so now what you have is </v>

678
00:31:21.461 --> 00:31:22.294
<v Speaker 4>you have moderate Muslims here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm defending the same book that the </v>

679
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:28.444
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalists over there are quoting </v>
<v Speaker 4>and citing to kill non Muslims over </v>

680
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:33.874
<v Speaker 4>there that the non Muslims are looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at this side of the world and that is </v>

681
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.143
<v Speaker 4>toxic because it actually makes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gives the impression the moderate </v>

682
00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:47.650
<v Speaker 4>Muslims over here are pretty much that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they subscribed to the same ideology.</v>

683
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.960
<v Speaker 4>They're just not acting on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not true,</v>

684
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.850
<v Speaker 4>but that's impression of gifts.</v>

685
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Not only is it not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that people like you,</v>

686
00:31:55.691 --> 00:31:58.150
<v Speaker 2>people like my new eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Haider,</v>

687
00:31:58.570 --> 00:31:59.403
<v Speaker 2>great people in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I think are fighting for the right </v>

688
00:32:02.051 --> 00:32:02.884
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are applying the same principles </v>

689
00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:05.404
<v Speaker 2>across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not looking at your faith or </v>

690
00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:10.660
<v Speaker 2>your race or your nationality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying,</v>

691
00:32:10.661 --> 00:32:12.610
<v Speaker 2>here are humanistic principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

692
00:32:12.611 --> 00:32:17.611
<v Speaker 2>That I want to apply to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left is the one attacking them.</v>

693
00:32:18.101 --> 00:32:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever expect that that was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the push back for you?</v>

694
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.530
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I didn't honestly.</v>

695
00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.071
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

696
00:32:28.071 --> 00:32:28.904
<v Speaker 4>I knew that there were a lot of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>moderate Muslims that wouldn't have </v>

697
00:32:31.881 --> 00:32:33.770
<v Speaker 4>problems with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't think that,</v>

698
00:32:33.771 --> 00:32:34.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

699
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:35.491
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

700
00:32:35.491 --> 00:32:38.460
<v Speaker 4>the sort of these cj wellman's and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

701
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 4>I guess whatever we call the regressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>

702
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dave,</v>

703
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.923
<v Speaker 4>I can't keep track of all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is just the one for most recent </v>

704
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:50.080
<v Speaker 4>memory,</v>

705
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.200
<v Speaker 2>but the list on the side of your bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a chalkboard and I've just always</v>

706
00:32:53.201 --> 00:32:54.550
<v Speaker 2>adding to the list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that.</v>

707
00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.960
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

708
00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.050
<v Speaker 4>I have better things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have enough time or crayons,</v>

709
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.450
<v Speaker 4>students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lots of bumps.</v>

710
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I am spending a fortune in shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

711
00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.003
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing with the regressive left </v>

712
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:09.660
<v Speaker 4>on a serious note is there they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>reacting to,</v>

713
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.593
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pushback that we're getting is a </v>

714
00:33:11.771 --> 00:33:14.280
<v Speaker 4>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for them I,</v>

715
00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.500
<v Speaker 4>I just look at that entire thing is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

716
00:33:16.501 --> 00:33:18.990
<v Speaker 4>very reactionary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their only argument,</v>

717
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:23.880
<v Speaker 4>the only argument they have to anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>as big an Islamophobe House,</v>

718
00:33:23.881 --> 00:33:26.130
<v Speaker 4>Muslim or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

719
00:33:26.131 --> 00:33:29.280
<v Speaker 4>the Brown skinned white,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it was.</v>

720
00:33:29.281 --> 00:33:30.114
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

721
00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:34.480
<v Speaker 4>So there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the only argument that they have.</v>

722
00:33:34.481 --> 00:33:35.171
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

723
00:33:35.171 --> 00:33:37.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually encouraged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm optimistic about it.</v>

724
00:33:37.421 --> 00:33:39.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you looked at in the past,</v>

725
00:33:39.581 --> 00:33:40.414
<v Speaker 4>every time one of these attacks happened</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was some conversation to be </v>

726
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:49.470
<v Speaker 4>taking place on tv about it on CNN or </v>
<v Speaker 4>msnbc or Fox or anything,</v>

727
00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.460
<v Speaker 4>it would always be Reza Aslan who would </v>
<v Speaker 4>come on or they'd call,</v>

728
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comedian guy,</v>

729
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:02.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on CNN deemed so him.</v>

730
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.940
<v Speaker 4>And so they would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

731
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.040
<v Speaker 4>they'd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's what they would do.</v>

732
00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:07.840
<v Speaker 4>But now I'm not seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

733
00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:08.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since,</v>

734
00:34:08.471 --> 00:34:09.304
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these new attacks and now that </v>

735
00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.010
<v Speaker 4>everything is getting even more serious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

736
00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:18.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing more of Majid on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing more of US trying to Monte on</v>

737
00:34:18.731 --> 00:34:20.080
<v Speaker 4>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

738
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing voices like this.</v>

739
00:34:21.641 --> 00:34:24.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing Ayaan Hirsi Ali being called </v>
<v Speaker 4>on to talk about things.</v>

740
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that most of the,</v>

741
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 4>even the so called mainstream media is </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing through it.</v>

742
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.253
<v Speaker 4>A Bill Maher actually said on the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>show that he was on or the one with us </v>

743
00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:40.720
<v Speaker 4>when he interviewed her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He actually said that he's more and more</v>

744
00:34:40.721 --> 00:34:42.460
<v Speaker 4>liberals are coming up to an agreement </v>
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>

745
00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.470
<v Speaker 4>They used to get a lot of crap from him </v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

746
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:45.843
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's changing and I </v>

747
00:34:49.541 --> 00:34:50.374
<v Speaker 4>think that this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we call the regressive left is </v>

748
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:54.250
<v Speaker 4>simply responding to them.</v>

749
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:54.991
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell you,</v>

750
00:34:54.991 --> 00:34:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean that sounds incredibly uplifting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

751
00:34:57.841 --> 00:34:58.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

752
00:34:58.311 --> 00:34:59.144
<v Speaker 2>I'm so in this and having these </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations and as I said at the top </v>

753
00:35:02.131 --> 00:35:02.964
<v Speaker 2>of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find a lot of it exhausting and I </v>

754
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.440
<v Speaker 2>battled sort of between back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>

755
00:35:07.441 --> 00:35:08.274
<v Speaker 2>can I move on from this topic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every time I move on I feel like I </v>

756
00:35:10.861 --> 00:35:13.220
<v Speaker 2>get sucked back in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

757
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it away and then I'll suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>see your,</v>

758
00:35:16.051 --> 00:35:18.030
<v Speaker 2>your twitter fight with someone or I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

759
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greenwald attacking Sam or whatever it </v>

760
00:35:20.731 --> 00:35:21.564
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think you gave me a little </v>

761
00:35:22.741 --> 00:35:27.690
<v Speaker 2>something to go with there because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that they are acting out more.</v>

762
00:35:27.691 --> 00:35:30.840
<v Speaker 2>It's getting more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a child having a tantrum.</v>

763
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.823
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's just because they realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the last vestige of an ideology </v>

764
00:35:36.061 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 2>that's just not gonna work because</v>

765
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.210
<v Speaker 4>we've woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

766
00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.693
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there are there prodding </v>

767
00:35:42.271 --> 00:35:46.230
<v Speaker 4>basically for a response and we give it </v>
<v Speaker 4>to them,</v>

768
00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in all honesty.</v>

769
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:49.410
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times I'll ignore it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile.</v>

770
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.730
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

771
00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

772
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.733
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like with,</v>

773
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll ignore it for very long time,</v>

774
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.153
<v Speaker 4>but if I do decide to respond to decide </v>
<v Speaker 4>response strong and it usually the </v>

775
00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:00.770
<v Speaker 4>response is not for the person making </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

776
00:36:00.771 --> 00:36:01.604
<v Speaker 4>It's for the rest of the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for everybody else who's watching the </v>

777
00:36:03.691 --> 00:36:04.480
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

778
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.080
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm under no illusions that I can,</v>

779
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.010
<v Speaker 4>I can change the minds of a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of hacks on,</v>

780
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:11.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

781
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.673
<v Speaker 4>that a lot of the trolls that actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>tried to dissuade us and trying to </v>

782
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.490
<v Speaker 4>deflect everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

783
00:36:17.491 --> 00:36:18.324
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that for the wider audience who </v>

784
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:24.570
<v Speaker 4>seen the conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good for them to see what they're,</v>

785
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 4>what they're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see both sides of it.</v>

786
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.450
<v Speaker 4>And to see that play out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

787
00:36:28.451 --> 00:36:32.880
<v Speaker 4>on whether on social media or in books </v>
<v Speaker 4>or in articles and so on.</v>

788
00:36:32.881 --> 00:36:33.870
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

789
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

790
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you,</v>

791
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 4>I think that they're reacting to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>

792
00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:42.150
<v Speaker 4>with Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris has a lot of great ideas.</v>

793
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.370
<v Speaker 4>He started a lot of really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations,</v>

794
00:36:44.371 --> 00:36:45.204
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that we're seeing right now </v>

795
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.633
<v Speaker 4>with the rise of Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the hijacking of this </v>

796
00:36:50.251 --> 00:36:51.084
<v Speaker 4>conversation by the sort of Xeno phobic </v>
<v Speaker 4>paranoid side and now them gaining </v>

797
00:36:57.571 --> 00:36:58.404
<v Speaker 4>ground and capitalizing on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the fear and the concern and the </v>

798
00:37:01.471 --> 00:37:03.550
<v Speaker 4>confusion that everybody's feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

799
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.190
<v Speaker 4>something that the left should have </v>
<v Speaker 4>done,</v>

800
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.880
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't do right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they should have done it from a sort</v>

801
00:37:08.881 --> 00:37:10.890
<v Speaker 4>of a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a honest,</v>

802
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:12.710
<v Speaker 4>a position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

803
00:37:12.711 --> 00:37:16.290
<v Speaker 4>and now it's being done by the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a Suunto phobic bigoted position.</v>

804
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.443
<v Speaker 4>I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is something that Sam predicted a </v>

805
00:37:21.061 --> 00:37:23.760
<v Speaker 4>long time ago that he wrote about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

806
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 4>and now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

807
00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.120
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

808
00:37:27.121 --> 00:37:28.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening is that,</v>

809
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

810
00:37:28.561 --> 00:37:29.394
<v Speaker 4>all of these spots back and forth with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the green walls and the world and you </v>

811
00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:34.554
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these other sort of characters </v>

812
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:41.360
<v Speaker 4>and they're deflecting from what was </v>
<v Speaker 4>initially that the actual thing that was</v>

813
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:45.000
<v Speaker 4>causing this response in the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

814
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.880
<v Speaker 4>Can you go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

815
00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.453
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just saying we should continue </v>

816
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:53.190
<v Speaker 4>what exactly what we were doing before </v>
<v Speaker 4>is what we should be doing.</v>

817
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 4>We should just be talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

818
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm sticking to the big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

819
00:37:58.411 --> 00:38:03.411
<v Speaker 4>I came from when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I came here to Canada and to the US</v>

820
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:08.810
<v Speaker 4>after living for 24 years and enlisted </v>
<v Speaker 4>majority countries.</v>

821
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.330
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to bring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk about big ideas,</v>

822
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.193
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't really concerned about </v>

823
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.360
<v Speaker 4>microaggressions or progressive left or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

824
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:19.194
<v Speaker 4>all of these other issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually wanted to talk about the big </v>

825
00:38:20.941 --> 00:38:22.530
<v Speaker 4>ideas and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

826
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.910
<v Speaker 4>I've noticed that the more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of us over here are,</v>

827
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are people who try to pull us into</v>

828
00:38:28.171 --> 00:38:29.004
<v Speaker 4>these more sort of petty Jerry Springer </v>
<v Speaker 4>like conversations and I think it would </v>

829
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:36.790
<v Speaker 4>serve us best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just ignore it.</v>

830
00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well listen,</v>

831
00:38:38.101 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing my best to</v>

832
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.273
<v Speaker 4>do that and I know I'm saying that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>especially after what happened last </v>

833
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:44.503
<v Speaker 4>week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm with me as well once in a while </v>

834
00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:49.123
<v Speaker 4>or what,</v>

835
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.233
<v Speaker 2>once in a while I think you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you have to look had all this </v>

836
00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.410
<v Speaker 2>terrible stuff and all of the slandering</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this stuff not happened.</v>

837
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Then I think the awakening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll,</v>

838
00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.480
<v Speaker 2>let's say you were awake probably before</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

839
00:39:02.481 --> 00:39:03.314
<v Speaker 2>I mean my real awakening to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally was that that night watching </v>

840
00:39:06.891 --> 00:39:10.190
<v Speaker 2>real time with that athletic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So had it not happened,</v>

841
00:39:10.191 --> 00:39:12.730
<v Speaker 2>I may have been slumbering through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:39:12.731 --> 00:39:14.690
<v Speaker 2>the left going further and further to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left.</v>

843
00:39:14.691 --> 00:39:18.200
<v Speaker 2>So in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is actually very empowering,</v>

844
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.293
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually a perfect segue to talk </v>

845
00:39:21.081 --> 00:39:22.400
<v Speaker 2>about next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you're touching upon,</v>

846
00:39:22.401 --> 00:39:26.240
<v Speaker 2>which is that by not dealing with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>in an honest fashion,</v>

847
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.560
<v Speaker 2>by not really allowing the people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak about it,</v>

848
00:39:30.561 --> 00:39:33.170
<v Speaker 2>the liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak about it in a fair way.</v>

849
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.230
<v Speaker 2>You're handing this to trump and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing this,</v>

850
00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.273
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing this right now in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing this in Europe where for </v>

851
00:39:41.361 --> 00:39:46.070
<v Speaker 2>the first time ever in places like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden and Denmark far right parties are</v>

852
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:49.820
<v Speaker 2>running on anti immigration because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all wrapped up in.</v>

853
00:39:49.821 --> 00:39:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're afraid to be called racist.</v>

854
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.120
<v Speaker 2>So it's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

855
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

856
00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.190
<v Speaker 4>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's Islamophobia,</v>

857
00:39:56.191 --> 00:40:00.990
<v Speaker 4>phobic fear of being called a song </v>
<v Speaker 4>phobic.</v>

858
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.510
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

859
00:40:03.511 --> 00:40:05.490
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're absolutely right.</v>

860
00:40:05.491 --> 00:40:08.100
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did in a way hand this to trump.</v>

861
00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.193
<v Speaker 4>The problem over here is that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump is not actually responsible for </v>

862
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.983
<v Speaker 4>all of this anti Muslim hate and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this kind of time with some sentiment </v>

863
00:40:18.121 --> 00:40:20.380
<v Speaker 4>that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's be clear on that,</v>

864
00:40:20.381 --> 00:40:24.930
<v Speaker 4>that the party that's responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is the attackers,</v>

865
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:25.923
<v Speaker 4>the isis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people who would talk to Paris of </v>

866
00:40:27.511 --> 00:40:30.290
<v Speaker 4>people who are making all these videos </v>
<v Speaker 4>of beheadings,</v>

867
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.390
<v Speaker 4>of journalists and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean these are the people,</v>

868
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.920
<v Speaker 4>a debt the Americans and Westerners in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general are reacting to.</v>

869
00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:38.581
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wait,</v>

870
00:40:38.581 --> 00:40:39.414
<v Speaker 2>let me stop you there because what would</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say to my friends on the left who </v>

871
00:40:41.161 --> 00:40:41.641
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

872
00:40:41.641 --> 00:40:43.530
<v Speaker 2>it's America that created isis.</v>

873
00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>

874
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.970
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's obviously a complicated thing,</v>

875
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:48.923
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>US foreign policy or there's US foreign </v>

876
00:40:50.881 --> 00:40:52.050
<v Speaker 4>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nationalism,</v>

877
00:40:52.051 --> 00:40:53.310
<v Speaker 4>there's greed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's power,</v>

878
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.153
<v Speaker 4>there's corporate corporatocracy and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these other characters that people talk </v>

879
00:40:56.401 --> 00:40:58.900
<v Speaker 4>about racism and misogyny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you were telling me that like,</v>

880
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.680
<v Speaker 4>why do you always pick on religion when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have all of these factors?</v>

881
00:41:01.681 --> 00:41:03.360
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always turned around and I tell them,</v>

882
00:41:03.361 --> 00:41:04.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

883
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.083
<v Speaker 4>It didn't belong them right up there in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same category with racism and greed </v>

884
00:41:09.541 --> 00:41:11.660
<v Speaker 4>and misogyny and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

885
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.070
<v Speaker 4>the terrible things that everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 4>is doing.</v>

886
00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:19.071
<v Speaker 4>So I do think that US foreign policy is </v>
<v Speaker 4>a factor and the argument has never been</v>

887
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.220
<v Speaker 4>that a religion is the only caused a </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious sentiments.</v>

888
00:41:23.221 --> 00:41:24.054
<v Speaker 4>He only caused the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not asking people to recognize or </v>

889
00:41:27.301 --> 00:41:29.400
<v Speaker 4>to think that it's not everything else </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's religion.</v>

890
00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:30.563
<v Speaker 4>We're just saying that the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're going against the idea that </v>

891
00:41:34.431 --> 00:41:35.264
<v Speaker 4>it's everything but religion to ignore </v>
<v Speaker 4>the religious aspect of it or the fact </v>

892
00:41:40.521 --> 00:41:44.930
<v Speaker 4>that beliefs actually have consequences </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we want to respect it.</v>

893
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.730
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

894
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 4>what I was saying earlier is that what </v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald trump is doing is that there is a</v>

895
00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:50.984
<v Speaker 4>lot of confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of fear that a lot of </v>

896
00:41:52.851 --> 00:41:53.684
<v Speaker 4>people have right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimately the way that you channel </v>

897
00:41:58.411 --> 00:41:59.244
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that leaders channel that is </v>

898
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.460
<v Speaker 4>what makes all the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

899
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.990
<v Speaker 4>So Donald trump has basically fed off of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

900
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.040
<v Speaker 4>He's drummed it up more for his own </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities,</v>

901
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:13.010
<v Speaker 4>this opportunistic purposes and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn into let's ban all Muslims.</v>

902
00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there was another reasonable voice,</v>

903
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

904
00:42:17.521 --> 00:42:19.730
<v Speaker 4>on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they had channeled that and they had</v>

905
00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:23.810
<v Speaker 4>kind of responsibly dealt with it in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>honest way,</v>

906
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.490
<v Speaker 4>then we may see a different outcome </v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

907
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.110
<v Speaker 4>when people are confused,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when leadership matters.</v>

908
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.500
<v Speaker 4>And that's where the liberals I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>failed.</v>

909
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.860
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

910
00:42:34.861 --> 00:42:37.410
<v Speaker 2>That naturally I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that premise,</v>

911
00:42:37.411 --> 00:42:40.890
<v Speaker 2>but I think you could really take it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the candidates themselves.</v>

912
00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:42.780
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders,</v>

913
00:42:42.781 --> 00:42:44.340
<v Speaker 2>who I like a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

914
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.080
<v Speaker 2>and Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

915
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.150
<v Speaker 2>when you take the candidates that are on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>

916
00:42:48.151 --> 00:42:52.260
<v Speaker 2>that are the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they won't say Islamic extremism or</v>

917
00:42:52.261 --> 00:42:54.090
<v Speaker 2>they won't say violent Jihad or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

918
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.730
<v Speaker 2>whatever the term you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

919
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.220
<v Speaker 2>everyone gets so caught up in terms that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate even using words at this point,</v>

920
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:03.060
<v Speaker 2>but when they won't even say the terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll just say religious extremism</v>

921
00:43:03.061 --> 00:43:04.470
<v Speaker 2>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

922
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 2>that they also then hand it to trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>because trump's just given you.</v>

923
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.630
<v Speaker 2>He's just given you the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wide,</v>

924
00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.273
<v Speaker 2>wide net to go with and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're still playing the games of </v>

925
00:43:15.121 --> 00:43:16.170
<v Speaker 2>political correctness.</v>

926
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.350
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I completely agree that,</v>

927
00:43:18.351 --> 00:43:20.830
<v Speaker 4>that is kind of what I was trying to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that they do it.</v>

928
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.673
<v Speaker 4>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are two things that have to be </v>

929
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:23.534
<v Speaker 4>done right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is that the rights of Muslims have </v>

930
00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:28.040
<v Speaker 4>to be protected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and number two,</v>

931
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.370
<v Speaker 4>Islamic doctrine has to be challenged </v>
<v Speaker 4>and criticized.</v>

932
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:34.070
<v Speaker 4>Both of those things have to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the,</v>

933
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.470
<v Speaker 4>what the Hillary Clinton or Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sanders,</v>

934
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.333
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a site is doing is they're trying to </v>

935
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:40.154
<v Speaker 4>protect all the rights of Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 4>without actually challenging the </v>

936
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:43.214
<v Speaker 4>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what the Donald Trump on the right </v>

937
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:49.970
<v Speaker 4>of these people are doing is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're challenging the ideology without</v>

938
00:43:49.971 --> 00:43:52.840
<v Speaker 4>protecting the rights of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

939
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:56.450
<v Speaker 4>and it's not an undead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People think that that's contradictory.</v>

940
00:43:56.451 --> 00:43:59.300
<v Speaker 4>It's not contradictory at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I think it was voltaire who</v>

941
00:43:59.301 --> 00:43:59.721
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

942
00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:00.091
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

943
00:44:00.091 --> 00:44:02.090
<v Speaker 4>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I may despise what you say,</v>

944
00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:05.420
<v Speaker 4>but I'll defend to the death your right </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say it's the same principle.</v>

945
00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:06.563
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not that difficult to do if we </v>

946
00:44:08.631 --> 00:44:10.970
<v Speaker 4>have a responsible leader who actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>does that.</v>

947
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.133
<v Speaker 4>I think that that is something that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people would relate to and they </v>

948
00:44:14.691 --> 00:44:16.400
<v Speaker 4>would understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

949
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:20.000
<v Speaker 4>we will challenge doctrine and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslims they'll get her like,</v>

950
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:20.834
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're challenging my religion and this </v>

951
00:44:21.621 --> 00:44:22.454
<v Speaker 4>is my identity because people </v>
<v Speaker 4>incorporate their beliefs into their </v>

952
00:44:25.521 --> 00:44:28.500
<v Speaker 4>identity and the dialogue would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

953
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:29.440
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a person.</v>

954
00:44:29.441 --> 00:44:30.830
<v Speaker 4>We respect your right to believe what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

955
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:34.020
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are ideas.</v>

956
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.510
<v Speaker 4>Ideas are different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the ideas.</v>

957
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about you as a person.</v>

958
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that if the,</v>

959
00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:43.340
<v Speaker 2>if there was a political party that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>running a,</v>

960
00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:44.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that said we're gonna throw gays off </v>

961
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:48.150
<v Speaker 2>roofs and we're going to stone women and</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill apostates,</v>

962
00:44:48.151 --> 00:44:50.310
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably be against that political</v>
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

963
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:53.070
<v Speaker 2>But as a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a religious doctrine,</v>

964
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 2>it gets a little extra credit or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

965
00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.120
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

966
00:44:57.121 --> 00:44:57.954
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of it completely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be completely strange things </v>

967
00:45:02.161 --> 00:45:03.580
<v Speaker 4>that we do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

968
00:45:03.581 --> 00:45:06.930
<v Speaker 4>of neonatal circumcision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like infant circumcision is one of those</v>

969
00:45:06.931 --> 00:45:08.350
<v Speaker 4>things where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

970
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:08.971
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

971
00:45:08.971 --> 00:45:10.310
<v Speaker 4>my parents did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

972
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 4>my siblings have done it to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>nephews and so on.</v>

973
00:45:12.541 --> 00:45:13.740
<v Speaker 4>It's a very dense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal.</v>

974
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:16.560
<v Speaker 4>You're not everybody does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you really think about it,</v>

975
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:20.970
<v Speaker 4>if there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there was no religion behind it or as</v>

976
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:25.790
<v Speaker 4>I like to save Abraham didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't so fond of dickheads you would do</v>

977
00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:26.853
<v Speaker 4>this would be child abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have pediatricians getting sued </v>

978
00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:29.660
<v Speaker 4>for this.</v>

979
00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.121
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

980
00:45:30.121 --> 00:45:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I want to circle back a little bit to</v>

981
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:36.000
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your history and your story for a second</v>

982
00:45:36.001 --> 00:45:38.280
<v Speaker 2>because you identify as an atheist </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim.</v>

983
00:45:38.281 --> 00:45:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Is that correct?</v>

984
00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he is Muslim,</v>

985
00:45:40.881 --> 00:45:44.930
<v Speaker 4>was the title of my book doctrinally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can't be an atheist Muslim,</v>

986
00:45:44.931 --> 00:45:49.370
<v Speaker 4>but the whole point of the book is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about the incorporation of religion</v>

987
00:45:49.371 --> 00:45:51.170
<v Speaker 4>into identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

988
00:45:51.171 --> 00:45:54.120
<v Speaker 4>so there are a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what,</v>

989
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.140
<v Speaker 4>so I'll explain it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I first came here,</v>

990
00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:59.173
<v Speaker 4>two years after I permanently moved to </v>
<v Speaker 4>permanently move to Canada is when the </v>

991
00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.910
<v Speaker 4>nine slash 11 attacks happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when that happened,</v>

992
00:46:07.911 --> 00:46:08.201
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

993
00:46:08.201 --> 00:46:10.550
<v Speaker 4>I had this whole conversation in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>

994
00:46:10.551 --> 00:46:11.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was part of a Muslim family.</v>

995
00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.010
<v Speaker 4>I grew up with Muslim people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

996
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.030
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in all the Muslim traditions.</v>

997
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.740
<v Speaker 4>They at that Ramadan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

998
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.800
<v Speaker 4>a lot of things are cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're reasonably cultural,</v>

999
00:46:21.801 --> 00:46:25.460
<v Speaker 4>but there's some sort of Muslim things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Ramadan.</v>

1000
00:46:25.461 --> 00:46:28.100
<v Speaker 4>So in doing so that was all a part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

1001
00:46:28.101 --> 00:46:31.310
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time I wasn't a huge fan</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the ideology.</v>

1002
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:33.200
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when I,</v>

1003
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:34.550
<v Speaker 4>when I came here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 9:11</v>

1004
00:46:34.551 --> 00:46:35.384
<v Speaker 4>attacks happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This whole conversation that had been </v>

1005
00:46:36.381 --> 00:46:37.214
<v Speaker 4>going on in my head for a very long time</v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly exploded and it was all going </v>

1006
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.250
<v Speaker 4>on on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was on the radio is everywhere.</v>

1007
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.730
<v Speaker 4>And there were two sides to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was sort of the,</v>

1008
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.350
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the liberal side.</v>

1009
00:46:48.351 --> 00:46:49.460
<v Speaker 4>And they said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1010
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:54.490
<v Speaker 4>Muslims must be protected as a minority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So any criticism of Islam is bigotry.</v>

1011
00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.673
<v Speaker 4>And on the right it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is the sort of the Fox News </v>

1012
00:47:00.261 --> 00:47:04.630
<v Speaker 4>narrative was that Islam is a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>an,</v>

1013
00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:05.960
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1014
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:09.020
<v Speaker 4>it's a violent religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so Muslims,</v>

1015
00:47:09.021 --> 00:47:10.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to profile everybody,</v>

1016
00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:13.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to clamp down on immigration,</v>

1017
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:14.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of those things.</v>

1018
00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:15.913
<v Speaker 4>And there was one mistake both of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>were doing is they were conflating the </v>

1019
00:47:19.371 --> 00:47:20.204
<v Speaker 4>ideology with the people putting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideology with the identity and this and </v>

1020
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:31.690
<v Speaker 4>this is where I wish actually a middle </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground and I think what we're seeing,</v>

1021
00:47:31.691 --> 00:47:34.420
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing the same thing with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>regressive left on one side.</v>

1022
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1023
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:36.244
<v Speaker 4>the Donald trump phenomenon on the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the same thing as the completion of </v>

1024
00:47:38.801 --> 00:47:39.370
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1025
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.940
<v Speaker 4>sort of ideology and people invite by </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1026
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:43.774
<v Speaker 4>I mean people who are a Muslim Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 4>just because it's as a birth identity </v>

1027
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:49.110
<v Speaker 4>because most people are Muslim because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a birth.</v>

1028
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:49.850
<v Speaker 4>That identity.</v>

1029
00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for you personally,</v>

1030
00:47:51.951 --> 00:47:54.740
<v Speaker 2>while you're obviously an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're a nonbeliever,</v>

1031
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.100
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you culturally Muslim?</v>

1032
00:47:58.101 --> 00:48:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Like what does that actually mean to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point?</v>

1033
00:48:00.111 --> 00:48:00.944
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume your family probably does some </v>

1034
00:48:02.301 --> 00:48:03.950
<v Speaker 2>holiday stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't believe in it,</v>

1035
00:48:03.951 --> 00:48:06.380
<v Speaker 2>but do you culturally identify the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1036
00:48:06.381 --> 00:48:08.240
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am an atheist,</v>

1037
00:48:08.241 --> 00:48:09.074
<v Speaker 2>I am not a believer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are Jewish traditions that my </v>

1038
00:48:11.811 --> 00:48:14.420
<v Speaker 2>family that my grandparents did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>their grandparents did,</v>

1039
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.580
<v Speaker 2>their grandparents did that my family </v>
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

1040
00:48:16.581 --> 00:48:17.414
<v Speaker 2>so I can do that and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't have a religious </v>

1041
00:48:19.641 --> 00:48:21.980
<v Speaker 2>connotation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a cultural connotation to me.</v>

1042
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.970
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what it is.</v>

1043
00:48:23.971 --> 00:48:26.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy not enjoy the FISA.</v>

1044
00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.730
<v Speaker 4>Ramadan Ramadan's a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You people fasting.</v>

1045
00:48:29.731 --> 00:48:32.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't necessarily fast but I'm there </v>
<v Speaker 4>for them.</v>

1046
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a bit much and I like to eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>celebration so I like,</v>

1047
00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:37.973
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have little nieces and nephews and </v>

1048
00:48:38.941 --> 00:48:39.774
<v Speaker 4>they all dress up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get them gifts and so I enjoy that as </v>

1049
00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 4>much as anybody I'm on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1050
00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:48.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm very close to my family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my nuclear family and my extended family</v>

1051
00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:53.280
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of them are believing Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 4>so I do take part in that.</v>

1052
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.463
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was also another place where </v>

1053
00:48:56.791 --> 00:48:57.960
<v Speaker 4>it affects you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For instance,</v>

1054
00:48:58.350 --> 00:48:59.183
<v Speaker 4>I read a story about this kid who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>called was beat up at school and </v>

1055
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:05.191
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1056
00:49:05.191 --> 00:49:06.024
<v Speaker 4>and they said that she was an isis baby </v>
<v Speaker 4>or nicest kid and neither one of my </v>

1057
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:13.530
<v Speaker 4>niece and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want my niece to go through that</v>

1058
00:49:13.531 --> 00:49:16.500
<v Speaker 4>and I did like this whole thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening in the US right now,</v>

1059
00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:17.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1060
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:18.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't want my.</v>

1061
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:20.580
<v Speaker 4>And I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got nieces and nephews in the U.</v>

1062
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:21.740
<v Speaker 4>S too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you got.</v>

1063
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:24.660
<v Speaker 4>So I don't want them to go through that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be completely heartbreak.</v>

1064
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.850
<v Speaker 4>I'd be devastated if I heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1065
00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:31.970
<v Speaker 4>my own niece went through something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just because she has a Muslim name,</v>

1066
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Muslim sounding name.</v>

1067
00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:39.300
<v Speaker 4>She looks a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it affects you at that level too.</v>

1068
00:49:39.301 --> 00:49:41.640
<v Speaker 4>So when things like that happen or you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1069
00:49:41.641 --> 00:49:42.480
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I recently,</v>

1070
00:49:42.481 --> 00:49:45.090
<v Speaker 4>I recently posted about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who's a physician.</v>

1071
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.800
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1072
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:47.843
<v Speaker 4>and he actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's in California and he went to a </v>

1073
00:49:50.071 --> 00:49:52.950
<v Speaker 4>party recently and there was a woman who</v>
<v Speaker 4>came up to him and said,</v>

1074
00:49:52.951 --> 00:49:53.784
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1075
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.633
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she called him a Taliban terrorists and </v>

1076
00:49:55.801 --> 00:49:56.634
<v Speaker 4>so on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she was a little drunk and </v>

1077
00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:00.840
<v Speaker 4>fortunately the people that he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>

1078
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jumped in and,</v>

1079
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.353
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they defended him and they called her </v>

1080
00:50:05.671 --> 00:50:06.504
<v Speaker 4>out on it.</v>

1081
00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:07.330
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1082
00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:10.620
<v Speaker 4>these are things that are happening and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's also an atheist by the way.</v>

1083
00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:14.600
<v Speaker 4>So he's from a Muslim background and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1084
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:15.443
<v Speaker 4>so when things like this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is something that could happen </v>

1085
00:50:16.771 --> 00:50:19.200
<v Speaker 4>to me as well that happened in my own </v>
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>

1086
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.980
<v Speaker 4>So on that level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do identify with,</v>

1087
00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:24.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sort of,</v>

1088
00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a lot of Muslims are going through.</v>

1089
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:29.570
<v Speaker 4>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also got a prejudice.</v>

1090
00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:30.404
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess apostates get it from not only </v>

1091
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:37.720
<v Speaker 4>the people who target Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Muslims who target a oscillates.</v>

1092
00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:40.160
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a bit of a double whammy there,</v>

1093
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:42.860
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you do relate to it.</v>

1094
00:50:42.861 --> 00:50:43.694
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very complicated thing when you </v>

1095
00:50:45.021 --> 00:50:48.800
<v Speaker 4>have that mixture of ideology and </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity is,</v>

1096
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.693
<v Speaker 4>it's a very complicated thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>navigate and it's not as binary as </v>

1097
00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:57.950
<v Speaker 4>simple as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you hear when you hear someone like</v>

1098
00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:58.993
<v Speaker 4>Glenn Greenwald talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or someone like Donald trump talk about </v>

1099
00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:03.330
<v Speaker 4>her do I think are sort of very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why I phrased the question </v>

1101
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.120
<v Speaker 2>the way I did because I don't see an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inherent contradiction there.</v>

1102
00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:11.163
<v Speaker 2>I think that everything that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>described sounds completely feasible to </v>

1103
00:51:14.511 --> 00:51:15.520
<v Speaker 2>me in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if anything,</v>

1104
00:51:15.521 --> 00:51:16.354
<v Speaker 2>it's not just feasible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds preferable to me because </v>

1105
00:51:18.581 --> 00:51:23.581
<v Speaker 2>you're taking the logical and the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the secular side of your,</v>

1106
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.753
<v Speaker 2>of your existence and fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledging that and then also </v>

1107
00:51:27.371 --> 00:51:28.204
<v Speaker 2>acknowledging your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your history and your family and all </v>

1108
00:51:30.101 --> 00:51:30.791
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1109
00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:31.624
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me makes full sense and more </v>

1110
00:51:32.921 --> 00:51:34.270
<v Speaker 2>people should be trying to do that.</v>

1111
00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:37.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there is a Phillips Zuckerman.</v>

1112
00:51:37.121 --> 00:51:40.000
<v Speaker 4>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a writer who wrote a book called,</v>

1113
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.370
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called living the secular </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1114
00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1115
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.273
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure that's what it's called </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that he actually talks about </v>

1116
00:51:45.851 --> 00:51:46.684
<v Speaker 4>secularizing religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He also did an interview with Sam </v>

1117
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:51.543
<v Speaker 4>Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris interviewed him for his blog </v>

1118
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:53.973
<v Speaker 4>and he talks about that as a very sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of seminal step in moving towards </v>

1119
00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:00.280
<v Speaker 4>secularism is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1120
00:52:00.281 --> 00:52:01.114
<v Speaker 4>you take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take the holidays and take the </v>

1121
00:52:01.991 --> 00:52:04.600
<v Speaker 4>rituals you take that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the community aspect of it,</v>

1122
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.850
<v Speaker 4>how they have Sunday assemblies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1123
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.113
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so those are examples of things that </v>

1124
00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.150
<v Speaker 4>people can do and how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1125
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:14.103
<v Speaker 4>religious actually move towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>secularism when you talked about reform </v>

1126
00:52:16.221 --> 00:52:18.910
<v Speaker 4>Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>

1127
00:52:18.911 --> 00:52:20.290
<v Speaker 4>which is interesting because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1128
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Judaism and Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1129
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.750
<v Speaker 4>very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1130
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:24.723
<v Speaker 4>how God revealed the Chron directly to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Muhammad in the same way God supposedly </v>

1131
00:52:28.031 --> 00:52:31.850
<v Speaker 4>revealed the Torah to um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1132
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.200
<v Speaker 4>to Moses at the Tabernacle and Mount </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sinai and so on.</v>

1133
00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:37.610
<v Speaker 4>And it was considered the literal word </v>
<v Speaker 4>of God.</v>

1134
00:52:37.611 --> 00:52:40.750
<v Speaker 4>It was actually considered the blueprint</v>
<v Speaker 4>for creation in genesis at one point.</v>

1135
00:52:40.751 --> 00:52:43.510
<v Speaker 4>So it was meant to even predate </v>
<v Speaker 4>creation.</v>

1136
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.260
<v Speaker 4>And that's how it was thought of at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1137
00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.840
<v Speaker 4>And then in the late,</v>
<v Speaker 4>late 18th,</v>

1138
00:52:49.841 --> 00:52:51.910
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the 19th century,</v>

1139
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.990
<v Speaker 4>early 19th century when the reform </v>
<v Speaker 4>Judaism movement really took hold in it,</v>

1140
00:52:56.410 --> 00:53:00.970
<v Speaker 4>it got demoted from literal word of God </v>
<v Speaker 4>to divinely inspired,</v>

1141
00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:05.650
<v Speaker 4>suddenly something that was written by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hands of human beings.</v>

1142
00:53:05.651 --> 00:53:06.630
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1143
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.880
<v Speaker 4>revelation became a progressive thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1144
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:13.960
<v Speaker 4>so it was a quality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They adopted a lot of secular values and</v>

1145
00:53:13.961 --> 00:53:15.580
<v Speaker 4>so on and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it changed.</v>

1146
00:53:15.581 --> 00:53:16.990
<v Speaker 4>So when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1147
00:53:16.991 --> 00:53:18.720
<v Speaker 4>the Koran is infallible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1148
00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:22.190
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to change it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I always think thinking good,</v>

1149
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:23.740
<v Speaker 4>the Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's precedent for that.</v>

1150
00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:26.490
<v Speaker 4>There's actually precedent for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would Judaism,</v>

1151
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:28.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the Catholicism for instance,</v>

1152
00:53:28.891 --> 00:53:29.724
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of Catholics who approach </v>

1153
00:53:30.361 --> 00:53:32.040
<v Speaker 4>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them practice birth control.</v>

1154
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.173
<v Speaker 4>Many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fornicated to their heart's </v>

1155
00:53:34.531 --> 00:53:35.980
<v Speaker 4>content,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1156
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:41.080
<v Speaker 4>you still go and they observe lent and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they celebrate Christmas and Easter.</v>

1157
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:42.480
<v Speaker 4>Nobody kicks them out of the church </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

1158
00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not a catholic.</v>

1159
00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:46.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1160
00:53:46.421 --> 00:53:48.880
<v Speaker 2>for the record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told this to Peter last week,</v>

1161
00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.610
<v Speaker 2>but I actually went to Mount Sinai in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1997.</v>

1162
00:53:51.611 --> 00:53:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I went to Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Sinai,</v>

1163
00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.870
<v Speaker 2>I hiked the mountain and literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happened.</v>

1164
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.980
<v Speaker 2>I asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1165
00:53:56.981 --> 00:53:59.380
<v Speaker 2>I really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at that place in life,</v>

1166
00:53:59.410 --> 00:53:59.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1167
00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:02.350
<v Speaker 2>20 or 21 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 19 and I,</v>

1168
00:54:02.351 --> 00:54:06.290
<v Speaker 2>I went there trying to have some thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talk to somebody and,</v>

1169
00:54:06.291 --> 00:54:07.870
<v Speaker 2>and nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody talked back.</v>

1170
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.060
<v Speaker 4>Bad experience the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to repeat it again.</v>

1171
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:12.023
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1172
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.863
<v Speaker 2>So I want to end with this because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have brought up a phrase that I think </v>

1173
00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:17.304
<v Speaker 2>you hashtagged and I want to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when this thing takes off that </v>

1174
00:54:20.701 --> 00:54:21.534
<v Speaker 2>you're fully credited for it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully I'll have a little something </v>

1175
00:54:23.221 --> 00:54:24.054
<v Speaker 2>to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've talked about the new center </v>

1176
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's the right phrase for </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we've been looking for.</v>

1177
00:54:30.211 --> 00:54:31.044
<v Speaker 2>I think it fits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fits because we have this left right </v>

1178
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:34.494
<v Speaker 2>paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also fits the center of this </v>

1179
00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 2>liberal split between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1180
00:54:38.161 --> 00:54:40.620
<v Speaker 2>the regressives and the say classic </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals.</v>

1181
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:43.800
<v Speaker 2>So can you just tell me a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more about what you think the new center</v>

1182
00:54:43.801 --> 00:54:46.980
<v Speaker 2>is and what we can all do to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get people there?</v>

1183
00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.113
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's basically what I described here </v>

1184
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:54.110
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to purely this aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Islam,</v>

1185
00:54:54.111 --> 00:54:57.650
<v Speaker 4>Islam and jihadism and sort of religious</v>
<v Speaker 4>extremism of,</v>

1186
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:59.270
<v Speaker 4>even though that's a misnomer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1187
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:00.323
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about separating ideology from </v>

1188
00:55:02.361 --> 00:55:03.194
<v Speaker 4>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about being able to stand up for </v>

1189
00:55:05.121 --> 00:55:05.954
<v Speaker 4>the rights of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time challenge ideas </v>

1190
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:11.450
<v Speaker 4>when you attack and challenge ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how society has moved forward.</v>

1191
00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:16.490
<v Speaker 4>A few attack and Dbas people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what splits people out.</v>

1192
00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:20.300
<v Speaker 4>That's what actually rips us apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So being able to do,</v>

1193
00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.390
<v Speaker 4>to make that distinction is very </v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

1194
00:55:23.391 --> 00:55:25.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't think either side is doing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1195
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:27.960
<v Speaker 4>I think that the center is more rational</v>
<v Speaker 4>and on a,</v>

1196
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:29.720
<v Speaker 4>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a broader level too.</v>

1197
00:55:29.721 --> 00:55:31.970
<v Speaker 4>I've always found it bizarre that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1198
00:55:31.971 --> 00:55:34.910
<v Speaker 4>if you're fiscally conservative and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1199
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 4>you suddenly you have to be prolife why </v>
<v Speaker 4>does all of that go together?</v>

1200
00:55:40.161 --> 00:55:44.730
<v Speaker 4>I think it's absolutely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People should be able to have different,</v>

1201
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1202
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:47.390
<v Speaker 4>I should be able to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1203
00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.790
<v Speaker 4>I believe in these fiscally conservative</v>
<v Speaker 4>principles,</v>

1204
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:53.780
<v Speaker 4>time I'm socially liberal or I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>have libertarian presented,</v>

1205
00:55:53.781 --> 00:55:54.614
<v Speaker 4>but there's no rational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can be a rational </v>

1206
00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:01.460
<v Speaker 4>thinking person and be aligned with one </v>
<v Speaker 4>side or the other.</v>

1207
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other topic.</v>

1208
00:56:03.721 --> 00:56:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Figuring out how the politicians figured</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to make everything a wedge issue.</v>

1209
00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:10.230
<v Speaker 2>So somehow gay rights if you were for </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay rights,</v>

1210
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:12.330
<v Speaker 2>you are also for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1211
00:56:12.331 --> 00:56:14.790
<v Speaker 2>low taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it just doesn't make any sense.</v>

1212
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.823
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think there's any chance for a </v>

1213
00:56:17.251 --> 00:56:19.050
<v Speaker 2>political movement with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you,</v>

1214
00:56:19.051 --> 00:56:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did Hashtag new center and I thought</v>

1215
00:56:21.751 --> 00:56:22.584
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not just not just this sort of </v>

1216
00:56:25.631 --> 00:56:26.464
<v Speaker 2>internal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a discussion that will all have and </v>

1217
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:29.314
<v Speaker 2>hopefully get it out there more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But actually this could maybe be a </v>

1218
00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:32.560
<v Speaker 2>political movement.</v>

1219
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:34.023
<v Speaker 4>I would like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I brought up the whole </v>

1220
00:56:35.341 --> 00:56:37.830
<v Speaker 4>fiscally conservative socially liberal </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing is because,</v>

1221
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.820
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1222
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:43.950
<v Speaker 4>when I grew up on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had the 6:00</v>

1223
00:56:43.951 --> 00:56:45.780
<v Speaker 4>news and the 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>news and you know,</v>

1224
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:48.870
<v Speaker 4>you saw everybody watched that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you're liberal or Conservative,</v>

1225
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:51.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean 1984 and Ronald Reagan won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1226
00:56:51.601 --> 00:56:54.570
<v Speaker 4>he won California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He won 49 states out of 50.</v>

1227
00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:59.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm not endorsing Ronald Reagan or </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing anything against him either,</v>

1228
00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:00.323
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying is that things weren't </v>

1229
00:57:01.741 --> 00:57:03.630
<v Speaker 4>as polarized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to later on,</v>

1230
00:57:03.631 --> 00:57:04.464
<v Speaker 4>you had 24 hour cable news,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you had Fox News on one side and </v>

1231
00:57:06.691 --> 00:57:11.691
<v Speaker 4>Msnbc on the other and everybody just </v>
<v Speaker 4>watched what their own echo chamber was.</v>

1232
00:57:12.001 --> 00:57:12.834
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll be every channel had its own echo </v>

1233
00:57:13.441 --> 00:57:14.274
<v Speaker 4>chamber with the blogosphere and with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Internet that became even more </v>

1234
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:18.083
<v Speaker 4>pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of polarization and I </v>

1235
00:57:20.341 --> 00:57:21.174
<v Speaker 4>think it's getting to a point and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing this with the regressive less </v>

1236
00:57:23.241 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 4>than I left on the trompe and right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1237
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1238
00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:28.423
<v Speaker 4>I think that there is that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>polarization is something that a lot of </v>

1239
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:34.280
<v Speaker 4>reasonable rational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1240
00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:38.520
<v Speaker 4>people are not feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not working for them,</v>

1241
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:42.960
<v Speaker 4>they're actually frustrated by it and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>really hope that they do.</v>

1242
00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:44.523
<v Speaker 4>They're okay to let go of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>traditional left and right labels </v>

1243
00:57:47.431 --> 00:57:49.890
<v Speaker 4>because I practically meaningless right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1244
00:57:49.891 --> 00:57:50.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they mean anything.</v>

1245
00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1246
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:55.680
<v Speaker 4>just be human beings thinking human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings.</v>

1247
00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:57.243
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect ending and I love the fact that </v>

1248
00:57:59.261 --> 00:58:02.050
<v Speaker 2>we've connected and you'll always have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an ally over here.</v>

1249
00:58:02.051 --> 00:58:02.884
<v Speaker 2>So next time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully we can do this in person when </v>

1250
00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:07.750
<v Speaker 2>you make it out to Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to thank Ali Rizvi.</v>
