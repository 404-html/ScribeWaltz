15
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 2>possibly be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been quite a journey.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean I remember that 94 nick's team so</v>

18
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 2>well that was like right in my formative</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of basketball,</v>

19
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 2>which I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said to you right before we started </v>

20
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 2>that that game six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which as an expat is probably one of the</v>

21
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:07.851
<v Speaker 2>most painful things you ever watched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A was the night of my senior prom and of</v>

22
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 2>course the night of the Oj Simpson car </v>
<v Speaker 2>chase.</v>

23
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 2>You lived through that whole experience.</v>

24
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at the Knick game that night.</v>

25
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.920
<v Speaker 3>I was at the Knick game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a playoff game.</v>

26
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:20.921
<v Speaker 3>I just written the theme song for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Knicks and started was starting to get </v>

27
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 3>momentum on the radio and in the garden </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was so,</v>

28
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:28.221
<v Speaker 3>I mean my whole life up a knick fan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it also was a big moment and here we </v>

29
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>game six at home and all of a sudden the</v>

30
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 3>Oj Chase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting like a pretzel.</v>

31
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 3>I went outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just looking at the monitor and I </v>

32
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 3>looked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

33
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 3>what in the world is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

34
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.290
<v Speaker 3>So they were showing you don't go out to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the concessions.</v>

35
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 3>It was on the Monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

36
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 3>I was conflicted and people were running</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth.</v>

37
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 3>It was wild.</v>

38
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy night because the,</v>

39
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.050
<v Speaker 2>the rangers had just won the Stanley Cup</v>
<v Speaker 2>finals I think,</v>

40
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.240
<v Speaker 2>and it was just like a great time to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York.</v>

41
00:01:55.241 --> 00:02:00.241
<v Speaker 2>Then Oj obviously people must've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about my prom so I can only </v>

42
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:00.670
<v Speaker 2>imagine what was going on over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

43
00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 2>so speaking of New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're from Roslyn Long Island.</v>

44
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm from syosset Long Island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're about 10 minutes away from each </v>

45
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.021
<v Speaker 2>other on the long island expressway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that a lot of interesting people </v>

46
00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:16.600
<v Speaker 2>come out of long island had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you found that?</v>

47
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Is that the water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

48
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

49
00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:23.551
<v Speaker 3>I was told I was actually just having </v>
<v Speaker 3>this conversation the other day with a </v>

50
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:24.040
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine and I was saying in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>town,</v>

51
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 3>if you took the year that I graduated my</v>
<v Speaker 3>senior year and went back for years and </v>

52
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:33.280
<v Speaker 3>forward four years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in that eight year gap or whatever it</v>

53
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:34.280
<v Speaker 3>is from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

54
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 3>of kids that went through my school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have A.</v>

55
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:41.890
<v Speaker 3>I think we have to with three </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional sports team owners.</v>

56
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 3>We have multiple billionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have five guys that I went to high </v>

57
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.841
<v Speaker 3>school is that are in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had multiple suicides and Bernie </v>

58
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.621
<v Speaker 3>madoff was from my town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I look at my town and think that </v>

59
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:57.940
<v Speaker 3>everybody had the same opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same teachers.</v>

60
00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 3>We had one movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was a small,</v>

61
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.100
<v Speaker 3>relatively small town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

62
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 3>one real high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one high school that everyone went to.</v>

63
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 3>A real sense of community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone had the same basically,</v>

64
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>journey through with as far as teachers </v>

65
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.351
<v Speaker 3>and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet we had this crazy swing of the </v>

66
00:03:16.351 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 3>biggest Ponzi schemer and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his family and sons were in our school,</v>

67
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that were super successful.</v>

68
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 3>People that had super successful parents</v>
<v Speaker 3>that went to jail,</v>

69
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all in this community.</v>

70
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

71
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 3>what was in the water in this town?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you make of that actually,</v>

72
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 3>because there's gotta be something </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

73
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even my high school,</v>

74
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:40.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew a couple people that I went to </v>

75
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:41.370
<v Speaker 3>high school with that ended up in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we also had judd apatow into my high</v>

76
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Idina Menzel.</v>

77
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Huge Broadway star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Natalie Portman.</v>

78
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until my high school and all sorts of </v>

79
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.961
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that I feel very lucky that I </v>

80
00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:53.970
<v Speaker 3>grew up in a town that I grew up in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the area that we grew up in that,</v>

81
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

82
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was diverse.</v>

83
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was creativity.</v>

84
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:03.601
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't far from the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had like a little bit of the city </v>

85
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:03.601
<v Speaker 3>vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

86
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:08.551
<v Speaker 3>I think it has something to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proximity because we were about 45 </v>

87
00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 3>minutes away from New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of our parents,</v>

88
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing maybe your parents who </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked in New York City,</v>

89
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 3>so there was like a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>commuter thing,</v>

90
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 3>but you weren't totally part of New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York.</v>

91
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 3>Like something related to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's part of it.</v>

92
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 3>I think for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just the time period that I</v>

93
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:23.070
<v Speaker 3>grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

94
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.200
<v Speaker 3>as a kid and there was just a change in </v>
<v Speaker 3>music change in culture and we would </v>

95
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:35.041
<v Speaker 3>just expose being close to the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had early exposure to all those </v>

96
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 3>trends and we were early to the party </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that had a big impact,</v>

97
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 3>at least it did for me.</v>

98
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 3>I know as an entrepreneur and in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>journey,</v>

99
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 3>it was exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was always exciting.</v>

100
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be part of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

101
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:51.541
<v Speaker 3>I got addicted to newness because there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was always something new going on and </v>

102
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 3>that fueled me even going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I feel very lucky that,</v>

103
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we grew up where we did.</v>

104
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Anything else I should know about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>formative years are family before we get</v>

105
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:02.790
<v Speaker 3>into some of the things that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

106
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.890
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

107
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 3>you can ask me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

108
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.610
<v Speaker 3>well if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's nothing else specific you </v>

109
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 3>said addicted to newness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I feel this is the right time to play</v>

110
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 3>a little clip from you as a rapper known</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Jesse James.</v>

111
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 3>Lovely.</v>

112
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me get my keys.</v>

113
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.450
<v Speaker 4>She said how was the pain of saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even try it.</v>

114
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 4>I pulled through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it,</v>

115
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 4>but Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she didn't.</v>

116
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.700
<v Speaker 4>She was laid off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

117
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesse James.</v>

118
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.350
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't in the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the email that you sent me about the </v>

119
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.350
<v Speaker 3>shelf there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to flash back.</v>

120
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.260
<v Speaker 3>We have a pretty crack research team </v>
<v Speaker 3>around here.</v>

121
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 3>We're going full flashback before we get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the future and the present.</v>

122
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 3>How did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

123
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.120
<v Speaker 3>grew up in long island in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

124
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 3>and hip hop was comment was emerging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got really into it at an early age and</v>

125
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 3>then when I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

126
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody was writing their resumes and </v>

127
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.250
<v Speaker 3>sending out resumes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

128
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to make a record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

129
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.920
<v Speaker 3>this is what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

130
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 3>there was no b plan and ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

131
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:47.201
<v Speaker 3>that passion really for three years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>college I was working towards trying to </v>

132
00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:52.091
<v Speaker 3>get a record deal and ultimately landed </v>
<v Speaker 3>a deal with a company called delicious </v>

133
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 3>vinyl out in Cali,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not far from where we are.</v>

134
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.350
<v Speaker 3>And they had two big accidents and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a guy named tone loke wild thing </v>

135
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.480
<v Speaker 3>called Medina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they had had a little bit of a </v>

136
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 3>tone loke feel to it that same </v>
<v Speaker 3>producers.</v>

137
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 3>And then we had a young Mc who won a </v>
<v Speaker 3>grammy for bust a move.</v>

138
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.210
<v Speaker 3>So I was able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

139
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that,</v>

140
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 3>but literally I was watching it this </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning and I said to David,</v>

141
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 3>my producer that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it sounded like.</v>

142
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same guys,</v>

143
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.050
<v Speaker 3>same year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same time and uh,</v>

144
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 3>and put an album out in the early </v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties.</v>

145
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was watching it and I was thinking </v>

146
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.980
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>time changes,</v>

147
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things change,</v>

148
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:31.060
<v Speaker 3>we get sensitive to different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would guarantee it.</v>

149
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 3>But if a young guy like you put that </v>
<v Speaker 3>song out now talking about a white woman</v>

150
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:40.451
<v Speaker 3>in a white rapper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd have a certain amount of people </v>

151
00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 3>screaming about cultural appropriation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all sorts of other stuff.</v>

152
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 3>Was that even remotely something back </v>
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>

153
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

154
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't on my mind,</v>

155
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:50.441
<v Speaker 3>but the shaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a white girl was my first single </v>

156
00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:53.320
<v Speaker 3>was actually a remake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the title of an old EU song or an old </v>

157
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.061
<v Speaker 3>Bogos song from abandoned Washington dc </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was predominantly all black.</v>

158
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.880
<v Speaker 3>So I felt like I was just kind of taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>the momentum of this hit song and </v>

159
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 3>introducing it to the theme to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>

160
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.100
<v Speaker 3>I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

161
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.310
<v Speaker 3>I wrote the whole album basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

162
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 3>as a fraternity in my fraternity house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

163
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty tongue and cheek.</v>

164
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:22.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of makes you wish that things </v>

165
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 3>were as simple as they were back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

166
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 3>Because you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you,</v>

167
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 3>are you following me on this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can just see like some fraternity</v>

168
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 3>kid doing something silly like that now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just like getting just like a ton of</v>

169
00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 3>shit for it.</v>

170
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Even if it was totally good natured and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>

171
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Speaker 3>it was totally good natured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I look back on it now and I think,</v>

172
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:42.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I were to go back in time I probably </v>

173
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.790
<v Speaker 3>would do a lot of things differently </v>
<v Speaker 3>just based on what I know now and you </v>

174
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.740
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm turning 50 so I'm very aware of,</v>

175
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what chapter I am in my life,</v>

176
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:55.550
<v Speaker 3>but when I looked back at me at 21 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I knew then and you know,</v>

177
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 3>all of the mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a 21.</v>

178
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

179
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 3>it's part of the growth and part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>journey.</v>

180
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

181
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.550
<v Speaker 2>So I want to get to some of the growth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the journey.</v>

182
00:09:03.551 --> 00:09:05.200
<v Speaker 2>I want to get to cook and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

183
00:09:05.201 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 2>But wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just jump back to the,</v>

184
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.080
<v Speaker 2>to the go New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go New York,</v>

185
00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:13.081
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How in the world did that even appear </v>

186
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 2>that you are going to be the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote that thing and were you shocked </v>

187
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 2>that it caught on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

188
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.030
<v Speaker 2>the video which we'll uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll also link to down below.</v>

189
00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember every moment of that.</v>

190
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.200
<v Speaker 3>So what happened for me is right after </v>
<v Speaker 3>college,</v>

191
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 3>no resume,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

192
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.510
<v Speaker 3>got rejected by a lot of record labels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no context.</v>

193
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:34.150
<v Speaker 3>My Dad owned a plumbing supply house in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mineola also now we had,</v>

194
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.380
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know anyone that was connected </v>
<v Speaker 3>to anything,</v>

195
00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:41.381
<v Speaker 3>so I had to take this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole process on my own shoulders </v>

196
00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:44.600
<v Speaker 3>and I would literally take a greyhound </v>
<v Speaker 3>bus on Friday from Washington dc where I</v>

197
00:09:44.601 --> 00:09:49.250
<v Speaker 3>went to school with my demo tape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a recording of an instrumental</v>

198
00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:53.510
<v Speaker 3>that I played on my cd player and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would hit record on my answering machine</v>

199
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.420
<v Speaker 3>and leave a wrap to the music while it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was playing.</v>

200
00:09:56.421 --> 00:09:57.820
<v Speaker 3>That was out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way I can man.</v>

201
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

202
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.830
<v Speaker 3>that just sounds like a time warp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that was the only way I could do </v>

203
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.541
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would show up and handout that </v>

204
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:07.541
<v Speaker 3>cassette to everybody and got rejected.</v>

205
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:09.680
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately I did get a record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

206
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.740
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get a record deal and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was my only goal.</v>

207
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.810
<v Speaker 3>So I took my foot off the gas pedal once</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the deal and I didn't get signed </v>

208
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.141
<v Speaker 3>for a second album,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which to me was crushing at the time </v>

209
00:10:23.141 --> 00:10:25.250
<v Speaker 3>because the only thing on my resume now </v>
<v Speaker 3>was failed rapper,</v>

210
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was also a Kiddie pool attendant </v>

211
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.861
<v Speaker 3>before there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that wasn't really going to get me a </v>

212
00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:32.861
<v Speaker 3>job on Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a low level.</v>

213
00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 3>Like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like training,</v>

214
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.900
<v Speaker 3>know no walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no peeing.</v>

215
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.590
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could say walk and stop,</v>

216
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.060
<v Speaker 3>stop peeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get the job.</v>

217
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:46.090
<v Speaker 3>They're always paying no matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you to get them out of </v>

218
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:46.460
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in any event,</v>

219
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.920
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though I didn't get picked up for a</v>

220
00:10:48.921 --> 00:10:51.500
<v Speaker 3>second album,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to marry my two passions,</v>

221
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:52.670
<v Speaker 3>which was sports and music.</v>

222
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.790
<v Speaker 3>And I had this idea to write a theme </v>
<v Speaker 3>song for the Knicks.</v>

223
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:57.680
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden sports,</v>

224
00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:02.681
<v Speaker 3>we're changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The game is only 48 minutes and you're </v>

225
00:11:02.681 --> 00:11:03.890
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fan for 48 minutes,</v>

226
00:11:03.891 --> 00:11:06.700
<v Speaker 3>but for the other two hours that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the arena during timeouts,</v>

227
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:11.830
<v Speaker 3>you're an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the teams had to entertain the </v>

228
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:11.840
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now they brought in the dancers.</v>

229
00:11:11.841 --> 00:11:16.841
<v Speaker 3>The dancers came in and they had video </v>
<v Speaker 3>boards that all of a sudden never </v>

230
00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:16.850
<v Speaker 3>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

231
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.120
<v Speaker 3>let's do a theme song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the bears did a song in 86,</v>

232
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.600
<v Speaker 3>let's do a theme song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will get all the celebrities involved in</v>

233
00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you'll catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote this demo basically in my </v>

234
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.940
<v Speaker 3>apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was like a dorm room and I played </v>

235
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:33.940
<v Speaker 3>it for the next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

236
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had you even get that meeting I had,</v>

237
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.250
<v Speaker 3>I started doing jingles.</v>

238
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and somehow I did a jingle for Nancy </v>

239
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Grunfeld clothing company or husband </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ernie was the GM and she loved the </v>

240
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:47.630
<v Speaker 3>jingle and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

241
00:11:47.631 --> 00:11:48.560
<v Speaker 3>Nancy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you love this,</v>

242
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.050
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do something for the next,</v>

243
00:11:51.051 --> 00:11:52.220
<v Speaker 3>let's try this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she said,</v>

244
00:11:52.221 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 3>I'll take a shot at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just did it on Spec.</v>

245
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 3>I walked in and I knew there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something there and I played it for them</v>

246
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 3>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

247
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll give you a $40,000</v>

248
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:06.250
<v Speaker 3>for the song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

249
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.310
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hired a right then and there you </v>

250
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.310
<v Speaker 3>said okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right then and there.</v>

251
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no lawyer,</v>

252
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.250
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't ask any questions of $40,000.</v>

253
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 3>It was eight months of rent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

254
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I hired a lawyer,</v>

255
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:22.450
<v Speaker 3>ultimately I needed a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>studio engineer,</v>

256
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Singer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drummer,</v>

257
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 3>producer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

258
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 3>It costs me $4,800</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do this song.</v>

259
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 3>But every team that came into Madison </v>
<v Speaker 3>Square Garden and said,</v>

260
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:36.510
<v Speaker 3>why don't we have a theme so this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next got hot and it became the </v>

261
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 3>number one most requested song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That little jingle on New York radio.</v>

262
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.470
<v Speaker 3>And I realized like that's the white </v>
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>

263
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.830
<v Speaker 3>nobody else is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's trying to get on MTV and get </v>

264
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 3>their records and tower records.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

265
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:52.170
<v Speaker 3>there's a category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new category that I could create </v>

266
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:52.170
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

267
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.680
<v Speaker 3>and I started doing theme songs for </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional sports teams.</v>

268
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.220
<v Speaker 3>It's so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just such a great story of </v>

269
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.210
<v Speaker 3>just like a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically a kid just like it over there,</v>

270
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 3>just get out there and do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of,</v>

271
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You must look at it back.</v>

272
00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:10.441
<v Speaker 3>I can see sort of in your face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's like a nostalgia to it </v>

273
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:10.441
<v Speaker 3>because it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was what it was.</v>

274
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I look at it from that chapter of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life where I had 21 years old I had,</v>

275
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.120
<v Speaker 3>there were no consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I didn't get this song,</v>

276
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 3>I would have gone to the next team and </v>
<v Speaker 3>kept.</v>

277
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.920
<v Speaker 3>I was so deeply connected to my dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like emotionally connected to the goal </v>

278
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.820
<v Speaker 3>that I was on greyhound bus every day </v>
<v Speaker 3>dry.</v>

279
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just to have the opportunity that it </v>

280
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.050
<v Speaker 3>was just everything else was gravy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

281
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.160
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so is that really where the </v>

282
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.711
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurial spirit started with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it seems like you've got that </v>

283
00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:47.701
<v Speaker 3>going and then that opened up a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>slew of other doors that opened up the </v>

284
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:51.031
<v Speaker 3>floodgates for some big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some big future successes and </v>

285
00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:55.081
<v Speaker 3>failures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was thinking about this actually </v>

286
00:13:55.081 --> 00:13:55.081
<v Speaker 3>yesterday on a run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

287
00:13:55.081 --> 00:13:55.720
<v Speaker 3>I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll probably remember,</v>

288
00:13:55.721 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're into tennis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the US Open was right by,</v>

289
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take.</v>

290
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flushing,</v>

291
00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:03.010
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would just take the train.</v>

292
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:04.870
<v Speaker 3>There were no rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

293
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.970
<v Speaker 3>my parent's home by 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>at night,</v>

294
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:12.390
<v Speaker 3>I would take the train and I remember I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would never have a ticket and all I </v>

295
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:17.131
<v Speaker 3>could look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would look forward to being able to </v>

296
00:14:17.131 --> 00:14:17.131
<v Speaker 3>try to sneak into the US Open and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember that,</v>

297
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 3>that I've kind of figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sneak into the u s open regularly.</v>

298
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.700
<v Speaker 3>So I would go no ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's online and I would go to like</v>

299
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.990
<v Speaker 3>how I went in and then I would walk out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see if I could do it again somewhere</v>

300
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was really the start of like,</v>

301
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 3>as I look back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I just want,</v>

302
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Speaker 3>I like challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

303
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.330
<v Speaker 3>it's not about anything other than can I</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure it out and,</v>

304
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:46.330
<v Speaker 3>and it started for me at an early age </v>
<v Speaker 3>and ultimately it gravitate,</v>

305
00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:51.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it started to gravitate towards </v>

306
00:14:51.331 --> 00:14:51.331
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

307
00:14:51.331 --> 00:14:51.331
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get there.</v>

308
00:14:51.331 --> 00:14:51.331
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

309
00:14:51.331 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Speaker 3>you're making the jingles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some things happen.</v>

310
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:58.121
<v Speaker 3>You're obviously making money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably some serious money for the </v>

311
00:14:58.121 --> 00:15:00.491
<v Speaker 3>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does this get you to starting </v>

312
00:15:00.491 --> 00:15:03.161
<v Speaker 3>incubators and starting these companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every team that came into Madison </v>

313
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Square Garden say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't we have a song like this who </v>

314
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:08.820
<v Speaker 3>did this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was the guy.</v>

315
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.700
<v Speaker 3>So I started writing all these 10 songs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and ultimately sold that company to a </v>

316
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:19.271
<v Speaker 3>public company called SFX.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the owner of SFX had a timeshare in </v>

317
00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:22.360
<v Speaker 3>a private jet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he invited was like 26 years old and</v>

318
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 3>he invited my partner and I as guests </v>
<v Speaker 3>onto his private jet and it was like the</v>

319
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 3>scene in the wizard of Oz when we walked</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the plane,</v>

320
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:29.780
<v Speaker 3>when everything goes from black and </v>
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>

321
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.820
<v Speaker 3>I walked on the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

322
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.220
<v Speaker 3>people fly like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the time we landed,</v>

323
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.520
<v Speaker 3>my partner turned to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

324
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 3>we got to start a private jet company so</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can fly around on these planes.</v>

325
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.130
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>

326
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 3>That's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's literally how we started this</v>

327
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:50.420
<v Speaker 3>company that ultimately be called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was called Marquis jet that,</v>

328
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:55.421
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>became the largest private jet car </v>

329
00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 3>company in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you eventually sold the company.</v>

330
00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 3>It's called nest yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

331
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:01.510
<v Speaker 3>it was called Marquis jet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you sold it to Warren Buffett's </v>

332
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 3>Netjet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a Berkshire hathaway company.</v>

333
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then now you're rolling in bill.</v>

334
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

335
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.520
<v Speaker 3>it was a change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely a life changing moment for </v>

336
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:12.520
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

337
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.290
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love newness and I was a at that time </v>

338
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:22.340
<v Speaker 3>in my life I had just ran 100 mile run </v>
<v Speaker 3>for charity and I gave myself 90 days to</v>

339
00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:26.150
<v Speaker 3>train for it and during the process of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my training,</v>

340
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.540
<v Speaker 3>I discovered coconut water because I did</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of research around hydration and </v>

341
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:31.540
<v Speaker 3>nutrition.</v>

342
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.310
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to run 24,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 miles nonstop,</v>

343
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:40.090
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you drink and how many calories </v>

344
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.960
<v Speaker 3>you take in and you're experimenting </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that with that now through your new</v>

345
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:45.650
<v Speaker 3>diet which you're going through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I discovered coconut water and which</v>

346
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 3>ultimately fueled me for this race that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I completed.</v>

347
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:50.390
<v Speaker 3>And when I was done I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

348
00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:55.391
<v Speaker 3>this is the fountain of Youth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be the next big thing </v>

349
00:16:55.391 --> 00:16:55.391
<v Speaker 3>in beverage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

350
00:16:55.391 --> 00:16:56.000
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the next orange juice,</v>

351
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.770
<v Speaker 3>this is the next poem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful.</v>

352
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:03.130
<v Speaker 3>And I spent a year traveling the globe </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how to import </v>

353
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:03.130
<v Speaker 3>coconut water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>

354
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 3>where yours is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a 2007,</v>

355
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.080
<v Speaker 3>2007.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like was money because it's not that </v>

356
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:11.080
<v Speaker 3>long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet,</v>

357
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.381
<v Speaker 3>coconut orders so massive right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd think this would have to be 25 </v>

358
00:17:14.381 --> 00:17:14.810
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in 2007,</v>

359
00:17:14.811 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even on the show.</v>

360
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.960
<v Speaker 3>There was one skew on the shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't,</v>

361
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.190
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't really exist.</v>

362
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I realized that the learning curve,</v>

363
00:17:21.471 --> 00:17:24.830
<v Speaker 3>I got like a 90 on my sat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The learning curve was 1200.</v>

364
00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:25.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

365
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm old ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should have called you.</v>

366
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.480
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

367
00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I can market this,</v>

368
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:34.490
<v Speaker 3>but like I don't know how I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>import this and so many moving pieces.</v>

369
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.210
<v Speaker 3>So I ended up partnering with a company </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a,</v>

370
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:42.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the scene called Zico just doing a </v>

371
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.161
<v Speaker 3>couple million dollars in sales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then ultimately two years later we </v>

372
00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:46.100
<v Speaker 3>sold it to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>

373
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.780
<v Speaker 3>then you're really in the business </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

374
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 3>Like at that point you've sold two </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies and,</v>

375
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.650
<v Speaker 3>and your role and how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you then go,</v>

376
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like newness.</v>

377
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.450
<v Speaker 3>What's new after this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what your story seems to </v>

378
00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.450
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

379
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 3>It's just like another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's new,</v>

380
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:01.650
<v Speaker 3>what's new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's new,</v>

381
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 3>what's new?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I get bored easily and I just,</v>

382
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

383
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.600
<v Speaker 3>I believe in checking the box and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>not celebrating what happened,</v>

384
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:11.460
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's next?</v>

385
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my whole thing,</v>

386
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I always talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just about building my own personal</v>

387
00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:17.820
<v Speaker 3>life resume,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even my business resume.</v>

388
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:22.821
<v Speaker 3>And Like I love adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was just looking for whatever that </v>

389
00:18:22.821 --> 00:18:27.410
<v Speaker 3>next opportunity was and it became,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was for me at the time,</v>

390
00:18:27.411 --> 00:18:29.880
<v Speaker 3>light of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next thing was a book,</v>

391
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.730
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't planned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't planned.</v>

392
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.760
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about that book a little bit </v>

393
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:37.760
<v Speaker 3>before we get to this book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

394
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:37.760
<v Speaker 3>I was at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

395
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 3>at a race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 24 hour race.</v>

396
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.900
<v Speaker 3>I love endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I participate in a lot of endurance </v>

397
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.060
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

398
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.250
<v Speaker 3>the race was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a really,</v>

399
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.240
<v Speaker 3>really format.</v>

400
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.240
<v Speaker 3>So I was a five friends and each runs a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mile and you rotate and whatever team </v>

401
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 3>runs the most amount of miles in 24 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours wins the competition.</v>

402
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.610
<v Speaker 3>But at the start of the race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy sitting next to us,</v>

403
00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 3>had no one to really with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had no teammates.</v>

404
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 3>He was his own team and he weighed like </v>
<v Speaker 3>285 pounds,</v>

405
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.280
<v Speaker 3>big African American guy just sitting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a chair.</v>

406
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:13.750
<v Speaker 3>Everything to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How in the world is a guy that weighs </v>

407
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 3>two 85 going to run for 24 straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours and the race was uncertain?</v>

408
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.800
<v Speaker 3>Are you even allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They let you run a relay.</v>

409
00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:21.960
<v Speaker 3>One guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like the always so low,</v>

410
00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:24.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by himself and it was just like.</v>

411
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.340
<v Speaker 3>And it was just so big and eating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the race was unsupported so they,</v>

412
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.140
<v Speaker 3>they provide nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was on a dirt one mile,</v>

413
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.370
<v Speaker 3>unlit parking lot.</v>

414
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.260
<v Speaker 3>And you hadn't even bring their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

415
00:19:34.261 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean they gave you nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had just sold my company.</v>

416
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:39.420
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went crazy on our side.</v>

417
00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 3>The seuss is a table set up like 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy had three items,</v>

418
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.000
<v Speaker 3>a box of crackers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fold up chair and a bottle of water.</v>

419
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

420
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.600
<v Speaker 3>this isn't going to work out well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sure enough,</v>

421
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 3>at mile 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

422
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:58.611
<v Speaker 3>because of his weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had broken multiple bones in both of </v>

423
00:19:58.611 --> 00:20:02.331
<v Speaker 3>his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He crushed the bones in his feet and </v>

424
00:20:02.331 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 3>he's from just the pounding because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just so big and because the only had</v>

425
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.160
<v Speaker 3>water and crackers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had kidney failure.</v>

426
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:09.030
<v Speaker 3>He was peeing blood down his leg and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>first reaction is,</v>

427
00:20:09.031 --> 00:20:14.031
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we gotta get this guy a medic </v>

428
00:20:14.031 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 3>immediately like airlift and add here to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hospital.</v>

429
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Boy Did he do.</v>

430
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.740
<v Speaker 3>He gets out of the chair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>picks himself up,</v>

431
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.040
<v Speaker 3>runs another 30 miles to get to his goal</v>
<v Speaker 3>of 100 and then runs one more in case </v>

432
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.360
<v Speaker 3>they miscounted and I immediately was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

433
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:29.510
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta I gotTa meet this guy.</v>

434
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.660
<v Speaker 3>I got to meet him because whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>secret sauce he has,</v>

435
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.150
<v Speaker 3>like whatever drive he has to get them </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

436
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.360
<v Speaker 3>get them out of the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even get a ribbon for funding </v>

437
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:41.430
<v Speaker 3>like pat you on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good job.</v>

438
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 3>There's no trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get extra crackers.</v>

439
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.950
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was like go home and that's that.</v>

440
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.250

<v Speaker 3>If I could teach that to my kids,</v>

441
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 3>if I could apply that drive to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple buckets of my life,</v>

442
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 3>then all the areas of my life would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much better.</v>

443
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.150

446
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.801

<v Speaker 3>the secret sauce in a lunch meeting and </v>

<v Speaker 3>just ask them like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you come live with me for a month?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm bringing a navy seal and for a month</v>

461
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 3>she called me after the lunch meeting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she said,</v>

462
00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:56.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did it go?</v>

463
00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.160
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very quickly isn't live with us.</v>

464
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.290
<v Speaker 3>She got into a big fuss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

465
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's sweet.</v>

466
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.070
<v Speaker 3>He's coming to live with us on Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

467
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she wants,</v>

468
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:15.991
<v Speaker 3>he came in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they immediately took to each other and </v>

469
00:22:15.991 --> 00:22:20.850
<v Speaker 3>it was just an amazing journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I never thought the notion of </v>

470
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.420
<v Speaker 3>writing a book never crossed my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

471
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:27.421
<v Speaker 3>the book came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the booklet living with the seal came </v>

472
00:22:27.421 --> 00:22:29.230
<v Speaker 3>out five years after he actually lived </v>
<v Speaker 3>with us.</v>

473
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because as I started to put some of the </v>

474
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.860
<v Speaker 3>tools that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned what I learned about myself </v>

475
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.900
<v Speaker 3>and about his mindset into action and </v>
<v Speaker 3>share it with others.</v>

476
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

477
00:22:41.351 --> 00:22:46.351
<v Speaker 3>there's something here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's sort of how it came to </v>

478
00:22:46.351 --> 00:22:46.351
<v Speaker 3>fruition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

479
00:22:46.351 --> 00:22:47.710
<v Speaker 3>let's explore some of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he gets to your house first day,</v>

480
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:52.711
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you have a plan or were you just </v>

481
00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:52.711
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take over man,</v>

482
00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:52.711
<v Speaker 3>you got a month?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

483
00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 3>make me better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said to,</v>

484
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:55.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make yourself at home is the first thing</v>

485
00:22:55.481 --> 00:22:56.590
<v Speaker 3>I said to him and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

486
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.650
<v Speaker 3>our home is your home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he walked right over to me and he </v>

487
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.710
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a home as you know,</v>

488
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.930
<v Speaker 3>make yourself at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just an expression.</v>

489
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got a little closer,</v>

490
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:08.200
<v Speaker 3>like nose to nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

491
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't operate in expressions as like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great little,</v>

492
00:23:13.721 --> 00:23:15.900
<v Speaker 3>great 30 day house guest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

493
00:23:15.901 --> 00:23:17.080
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your stuff on.</v>

494
00:23:17.081 --> 00:23:22.081
<v Speaker 3>Let's go see where you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Physically will go down to the gym so I </v>

495
00:23:22.081 --> 00:23:22.081
<v Speaker 3>can map out the month.</v>

496
00:23:22.081 --> 00:23:24.010
<v Speaker 3>And when he came to live with us at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>time in my life,</v>

497
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 3>I was in a great spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

498
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 3>I was married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still married,</v>

499
00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:32.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had just had a child and now for had </v>

500
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.580
<v Speaker 3>some failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had some success.</v>

501
00:23:33.581 --> 00:23:35.470
<v Speaker 3>But I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was in a really good spot.</v>

502
00:23:35.471 --> 00:23:39.270
<v Speaker 3>But like so many of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in a routine now,</v>

503
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.800
<v Speaker 3>it was really comfortable in my routine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My routine was get up,</v>

504
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:44.290
<v Speaker 3>work out hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to work all day,</v>

505
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 3>come home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some dinner with my wife and child,</v>

506
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:52.060
<v Speaker 3>little bit of alone time repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I thought I was operating up </v>

507
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 3>here but I was so comfortable I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of it.</v>

508
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.030
<v Speaker 3>And like you routines are great but they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can also be a Rut.</v>

509
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I realized like I don't want to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through life like this.</v>

510
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Like I want to go through life like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

511
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I got to get out of my routine man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise I'm going to wake up and I'll </v>

512
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:10.700
<v Speaker 3>be 70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think that that routine,</v>

513
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.760
<v Speaker 3>even when it's all going well and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds like things were going pretty </v>

514
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:15.760
<v Speaker 3>well for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that no matter what,</v>

515
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.150
<v Speaker 3>that level of routine will automatically</v>
<v Speaker 3>stifle creativity without question and,</v>

516
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 3>and time goes fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have four kids,</v>

517
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:25.320
<v Speaker 3>I want to slow the clock down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

518
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 3>And if I'm in routine and your routine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you miss a lot of opportunities,</v>

519
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:34.841
<v Speaker 3>at least for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way I've found my life to </v>

520
00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:37.301
<v Speaker 3>unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like when I stepped out of </v>

521
00:24:37.301 --> 00:24:37.301
<v Speaker 3>routine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

522
00:24:37.301 --> 00:24:41.920
<v Speaker 3>when I go into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where amazing growth happens and </v>

523
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.421
<v Speaker 3>that's where I feel most alive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where I get the most benefit and </v>

524
00:24:46.421 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's a check the box and move</v>
<v Speaker 3>on mentality.</v>

525
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:50.990
<v Speaker 3>And that's what this opportunity was for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

526
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 3>Nothing other than to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

527
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:58.210
<v Speaker 3>to step into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He represented unknown and a and a </v>

528
00:24:58.311 --> 00:25:01.430
<v Speaker 3>little bit of secret sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'd go down to my gym and you know,</v>

529
00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:02.870
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me see how many posts you can do.</v>

530
00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Speaker 3>So I got up and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

531
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:10.150
<v Speaker 3>I can run pretty far in a circle or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight line for a long time but not </v>

532
00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.620
<v Speaker 3>really strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did like a,</v>

533
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.840
<v Speaker 3>like eight pull ups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an exaggeration,</v>

534
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.940
<v Speaker 3>like for like two bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he started wait 30 seconds and </v>

535
00:25:21.411 --> 00:25:26.411
<v Speaker 3>do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got back on the bar and I did </v>

536
00:25:26.411 --> 00:25:26.411
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one or two or something,</v>

537
00:25:26.411 --> 00:25:26.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barely.</v>

538
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.070
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait 30 seconds,</v>

539
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:31.580
<v Speaker 3>I want you to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now like my arms are like I get back</v>

540
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:34.400
<v Speaker 3>on the bar and I'm trying to get my chin</v>
<v Speaker 3>up over the bar.</v>

541
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 3>And I dropped down and I started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what's next?</v>

542
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.880
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what's next is we're not leaving </v>

543
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:42.890
<v Speaker 3>here until you do 100 more Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

544
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.410
<v Speaker 3>that's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do 100.</v>

545
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.330
<v Speaker 3>And he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

546
00:25:47.331 --> 00:25:50.180
<v Speaker 3>I already know what your biggest problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

547
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 3>but probably with all of our biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem is.</v>

548
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.700
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the limitations that you're putting </v>

549
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.821
<v Speaker 3>on herself that we put on ourselves are </v>
<v Speaker 3>self imposed and I'm going to prove it </v>

550
00:26:00.821 --> 00:26:05.081
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So get back up on fucking bar and give </v>

551
00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:08.591
<v Speaker 3>me a pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did a pull up and I dropped down </v>

552
00:26:08.591 --> 00:26:10.310
<v Speaker 3>and I repeated that process until I did </v>
<v Speaker 3>all hundred holy.</v>

553
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.520
<v Speaker 3>And I realized it took like two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I realized at that moment that if </v>

554
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm under indexing by 100 pull ups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what are the areas of my life and </v>

555
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:21.890
<v Speaker 3>my under indexing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

556
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.000
<v Speaker 3>am I under indexing at work with my wife</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my relationships?</v>

557
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Am I comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I in this routine?</v>

558
00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:33.101
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't want to go to that place </v>

559
00:26:33.101 --> 00:26:35.591
<v Speaker 3>of pain to see what I was really made up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that started our journey and that </v>

560
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:39.770
<v Speaker 3>was a constant theme of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how far can you take this,</v>

561
00:26:39.771 --> 00:26:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Jesse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

562
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you holding yourself back?</v>

563
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:45.750
<v Speaker 3>And not physically but in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in everything,</v>

564
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 3>in work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

565
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 3>You've had some success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do you know your limits?</v>

566
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:55.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like when I started running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my goal was to run two miles.</v>

567
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:01.310
<v Speaker 3>If I could run two miles in 18 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I consider myself a runner and that was </v>

568
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.680
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I worked hard to get.</v>

569
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 3>Took me weeks to go from the couch to </v>
<v Speaker 3>those two miles.</v>

570
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people with a gun to </v>
<v Speaker 3>their head.</v>

571
00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:11.940
<v Speaker 3>They can run two miles right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing changed in my body since then.</v>

572
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:16.970
<v Speaker 3>Same legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same long as God gave me saying I'm not </v>

573
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.821
<v Speaker 3>really strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was able to take that same body </v>

574
00:27:19.821 --> 00:27:23.151
<v Speaker 3>guy gave me from two miles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately take it to 100 miles without </v>

575
00:27:23.151 --> 00:27:27.660
<v Speaker 3>stopping and the only thing that changed</v>
<v Speaker 3>was what I thought I could do.</v>

576
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:33.210
<v Speaker 3>So if I was under indexing 50 x in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>area again,</v>

577
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:39.530
<v Speaker 3>what am I limits in business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I limits in my life resume and </v>

578
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:43.200
<v Speaker 3>how I live my life and what am I limits </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how deep my relationships can be and</v>

579
00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:47.970
<v Speaker 3>what am I limits in how much I can learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're travel or anything.</v>

580
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.930
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's probably easy for people</v>
<v Speaker 3>at some level to understand the </v>

581
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:54.600
<v Speaker 3>quantifiable stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can run faster,</v>

582
00:27:54.601 --> 00:27:56.580
<v Speaker 3>I can lift more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of stuff.</v>

583
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Could you talk about it sort of on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental side,</v>

584
00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:03.450
<v Speaker 3>on the relationship side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how do you actually judge what are </v>

585
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.070
<v Speaker 3>the right ways to spread yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>those areas?</v>

586
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.670
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

587
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:07.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for me,</v>

588
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people and we think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about relationships.</v>

589
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.230
<v Speaker 3>We think of relationships between </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

590
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:18.060
<v Speaker 3>How is your relationship with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents or your child or your husband or</v>

591
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:23.061
<v Speaker 3>wife or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think one thing that's often very </v>

592
00:28:23.061 --> 00:28:26.971
<v Speaker 3>neglected is our relationship with time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and talk about quantifiable stuff and </v>

593
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm very aware of my relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

594
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:35.931
<v Speaker 3>That's been a fundamental shift for me </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the last couple of years and maybe </v>

595
00:28:35.931 --> 00:28:37.530
<v Speaker 3>because I've turned 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was recently on a,</v>

596
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.510
<v Speaker 3>on a camping trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look like you're 28.</v>

597
00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.460
<v Speaker 3>He's doing something right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know man,</v>

598
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.650
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's long island,</v>

599
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:50.090
<v Speaker 3>but I was recently on a camping trip and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was with a friend of mine as a police </v>

600
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.450
<v Speaker 3>officer and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Kennedy County.</v>

601
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.480
<v Speaker 3>He had his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had my son and we went on a on a cold </v>

602
00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.320
<v Speaker 3>winter now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington blizzardy outdoor,</v>

603
00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:02.430
<v Speaker 3>sleeping in the snow camping trip and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned to him and I said,</v>

604
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Cathy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how often do you do trips like this?</v>

605
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 3>This is a guy that's a police officer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

606
00:29:08.281 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 3>one of the happiest guys I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably not super well off.</v>

607
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

608
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:16.650
<v Speaker 3>a blue collar guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely happy and he says,</v>

609
00:29:16.651 --> 00:29:21.651
<v Speaker 3>I take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said every year I take one trip a </v>

610
00:29:21.651 --> 00:29:22.500
<v Speaker 3>year with my college friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing it for 21 years old.</v>

611
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Then every other month I take a trip </v>
<v Speaker 3>with my family or myself.</v>

612
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 3>It'd be running a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be go to the lake,</v>

613
00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:29.940
<v Speaker 3>it could be going on a hike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

614
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.730
<v Speaker 3>And I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can't take,</v>

615
00:29:32.731 --> 00:29:37.731
<v Speaker 3>I call it Kevin's rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one weekend every eight weeks for my own</v>

616
00:29:38.731 --> 00:29:43.731
<v Speaker 3>adventure with my family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with friends and doesn't have to be </v>

617
00:29:43.731 --> 00:29:46.531
<v Speaker 3>something that costs a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I can think five or six of those </v>

618
00:29:46.531 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 3>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm way out of balance.</v>

619
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.010
<v Speaker 3>So it might not be a direct answer to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your question,</v>

620
00:29:52.011 --> 00:29:53.630
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

621
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:58.710
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could in the past maybe that would </v>

622
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 3>be one or two times a year and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't even be aware of it.</v>

623
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:05.670
<v Speaker 3>But once you become aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look over the next 30 years you're </v>

624
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.930
<v Speaker 3>talking about 150 memories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

625
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.840
<v Speaker 3>it's all cumulative as opposed to maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

626
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:15.841
<v Speaker 3>30 memories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference of like a really </v>

627
00:30:15.841 --> 00:30:19.530
<v Speaker 3>full life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be at the end of the day with </v>

628
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.850
<v Speaker 3>no regrets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with no regrets versus someone that's in</v>

629
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:26.851
<v Speaker 3>their routine going through life like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and then you wake up and you're 75 </v>

630
00:30:26.961 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

631
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the energy to go to Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington anymore.</v>

632
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:33.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't have my son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My kids are grown up,</v>

633
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:39.030
<v Speaker 3>so those kinds of shifts are measurable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can pinpoint in time,</v>

634
00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.270
<v Speaker 3>I can pinpoint into my relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife and just Friday night dinners,</v>

635
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.560
<v Speaker 3>Wednesday night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>date night.</v>

636
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.070
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your relationship with time?</v>

637
00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:53.071
<v Speaker 3>How do you spend it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Do you spend it with and are you </v>

638
00:30:53.071 --> 00:30:53.071
<v Speaker 3>doing the things you love to do?</v>

639
00:30:53.071 --> 00:30:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's definitely a good segue to </v>

640
00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.190
<v Speaker 2>living with monks so quickly though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have some of those people in your</v>

641
00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:04.191
<v Speaker 2>life where Kevin just said about </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconnect with the high school friends </v>

642
00:31:04.191 --> 00:31:07.131
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I find now a couple of my most </v>

643
00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:07.800
<v Speaker 2>valuable relationships that I have right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now are with.</v>

644
00:31:07.801 --> 00:31:09.920
<v Speaker 2>One of them's my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my childhood best friends since,</v>

645
00:31:09.921 --> 00:31:11.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since we were four years old,</v>

646
00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I remember meeting the guy and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>kindergarten and I think it,</v>

647
00:31:14.511 --> 00:31:17.880
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was the day before kindergarten</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then another friend from third grade</v>

648
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.120
<v Speaker 2>and we've stayed connected and because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that it helps me frame the future </v>

649
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:28.130
<v Speaker 2>because we've been having these same </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations about love and life and </v>

650
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.570
<v Speaker 2>sports and politics forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like watching us all,</v>

651
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them lives in jersey,</v>

652
00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:37.011
<v Speaker 2>ones in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Texas and I'm here in La and yet our </v>

653
00:31:37.011 --> 00:31:38.010
<v Speaker 2>journeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still matter to each other.</v>

654
00:31:38.011 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 2>So I think it helps set the future sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

655
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fortunate that I do,</v>

656
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so,</v>

657
00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:45.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

658
00:31:45.231 --> 00:31:49.050
<v Speaker 3>so at the same high school friends and </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends from my neighborhood when I grew</v>

659
00:31:49.051 --> 00:31:50.580
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still super close to.</v>

660
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.740
<v Speaker 3>And I think you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

661
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.720
<v Speaker 3>we're so lucky to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

662
00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.030
<v Speaker 3>it's still a big part of my life that </v>
<v Speaker 3>those relationships and also,</v>

663
00:32:00.031 --> 00:32:05.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can relate to the back story very </v>

664
00:32:05.031 --> 00:32:06.410
<v Speaker 3>often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I meet someone now they know Jesse at</v>

665
00:32:06.411 --> 00:32:08.250
<v Speaker 3>50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know Jesse.</v>

666
00:32:08.251 --> 00:32:10.800
<v Speaker 3>It's six and Roslyn little league and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know Jesse,</v>

667
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

668
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.240
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we probably a year,</v>

669
00:32:13.241 --> 00:32:15.900
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we probably played little league against</v>

670
00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:17.400
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a couple of years.</v>

671
00:32:17.401 --> 00:32:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

672
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

673
00:32:18.121 --> 00:32:19.920
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But same thing.</v>

674
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I agree with you.</v>

675
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.350
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

676
00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:29.580
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all of my friends from high </v>

677
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:33.261
<v Speaker 3>school and even college and even today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they invest time and keeping </v>

678
00:32:33.421 --> 00:32:38.421
<v Speaker 3>those relationships so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can do it easily now through </v>

679
00:32:38.421 --> 00:32:38.700
<v Speaker 3>facebook and social media and this kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of stuff,</v>

680
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.380
<v Speaker 3>but often we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm fortunate that my group of </v>

681
00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do,</v>

682
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:45.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had for awhile,</v>

683
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.990
<v Speaker 3>we have a newsletter that we put </v>
<v Speaker 3>together for each other and um,</v>

684
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:50.900
<v Speaker 3>it makes me smile just thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

685
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:52.160
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

686
00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 3>just feel really lucky.</v>

687
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's shift to your new book,</v>

688
00:32:55.891 --> 00:32:58.650
<v Speaker 2>living with the monks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get the subtitle totally right</v>

689
00:32:58.651 --> 00:33:00.210
<v Speaker 2>here because I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

690
00:33:00.211 --> 00:33:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Turning off my phone taught me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness,</v>

691
00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:05.100
<v Speaker 2>gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and focus.</v>

692
00:33:05.101 --> 00:33:10.101
<v Speaker 2>So we are taping this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're holding it for a little bit </v>

693
00:33:10.111 --> 00:33:15.111
<v Speaker 2>because I want to air this right before </v>
<v Speaker 2>I go off the grid because my audience </v>

694
00:33:15.111 --> 00:33:15.120
<v Speaker 2>knows I do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>August off the grid thing,</v>

695
00:33:15.121 --> 00:33:18.150
<v Speaker 2>literally locked my phone and it's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No phone,</v>

696
00:33:18.151 --> 00:33:19.920
<v Speaker 2>no TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no electronics,</v>

697
00:33:19.921 --> 00:33:24.921
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work on my book a little </v>

698
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:27.291
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably escape to a beach for a </v>

699
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:27.291
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even totally sure what I'm going</v>

700
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:29.970
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just get off the endless information</v>

701
00:33:29.971 --> 00:33:34.971
<v Speaker 2>grid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before we talk about me and why I </v>

702
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:37.710
<v Speaker 2>think it's good to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What led you to wanting to do this first</v>

703
00:33:37.711 --> 00:33:38.100
<v Speaker 2>place?</v>

704
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd spent.</v>

705
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:43.150
<v Speaker 3>I'd invested so much in the physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>side for my whole life,</v>

706
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:48.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>running marathons and doing endurance </v>

707
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:48.300
<v Speaker 3>events and had a navy seal move in with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

708
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:53.750
<v Speaker 3>but I really had felt like I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>neglected the inner side and just the </v>

709
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:58.020
<v Speaker 3>inner work and I was just going so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I felt too to really,</v>

710
00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.850
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm turning to gold,</v>

711
00:33:59.851 --> 00:34:04.851
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to get the whole package or that </v>

712
00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:08.690
<v Speaker 3>what I want and be as well rounded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really needed that side is the </v>

713
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.330
<v Speaker 3>spiritual side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

714
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.660
<v Speaker 3>and I was just thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well who would be the best teacher?</v>

715
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 3>And I thought monks and I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about monks other than like </v>

716
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.840
<v Speaker 3>watching some movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

717
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.770
<v Speaker 3>fringe articles here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that'd be really cool to learn</v>

718
00:34:22.771 --> 00:34:23.730
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

719
00:34:23.731 --> 00:34:25.950
<v Speaker 3>the traditions and how amongst lived </v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives.</v>

720
00:34:25.951 --> 00:34:28.680
<v Speaker 3>And I'm doing exactly what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

721
00:34:28.681 --> 00:34:32.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm bombarded by information and I don't</v>

722
00:34:32.881 --> 00:34:36.960
<v Speaker 3>spend any time alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you don't spend time alone,</v>

723
00:34:36.961 --> 00:34:41.961
<v Speaker 3>you lose your super power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use your intuition because you're being </v>

724
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:43.710
<v Speaker 3>influenced by everybody else and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't exercise your gut muscle.</v>

725
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.730
<v Speaker 3>I was losing my superpower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said to Sarah,</v>

726
00:34:47.731 --> 00:34:49.230
<v Speaker 3>I think I want to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

727
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:54.610
<v Speaker 2>was there a moment that you really felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you had lost it or that you could </v>

728
00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.881
<v Speaker 2>really recognize that you lost?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think a lot of people walk </v>

729
00:34:57.881 --> 00:34:57.881
<v Speaker 2>around with that all the time now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

730
00:34:57.881 --> 00:35:00.620
<v Speaker 2>because the endless social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so hit with stuff constantly that</v>

731
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:05.621
<v Speaker 2>it does make your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your sort of inner monologue sort of </v>

732
00:35:05.621 --> 00:35:07.590
<v Speaker 2>harder to listen to because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>being slammed in every which direction.</v>

733
00:35:07.591 --> 00:35:10.130
<v Speaker 2>It was a buildup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just felt so distracted.</v>

734
00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

735
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.130
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all feel overwhelmed.</v>

736
00:35:13.131 --> 00:35:18.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I felt really distracted and I felt </v>

737
00:35:18.131 --> 00:35:18.131
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

738
00:35:18.131 --> 00:35:20.930
<v Speaker 3>I have four kids a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm married friends.</v>

739
00:35:20.931 --> 00:35:23.600
<v Speaker 3>My parents are getting older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all of these different things.</v>

740
00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:28.601
<v Speaker 3>And then all these different social </v>
<v Speaker 3>media things and news and Netflix and </v>

741
00:35:28.601 --> 00:35:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Hulu about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to,</v>

742
00:35:29.751 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to just be alone.</v>

743
00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:37.880
<v Speaker 3>And so it was a buildup and then my wife</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I were talking about it as they just</v>

744
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.230
<v Speaker 3>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go and live in a monastery.</v>

745
00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:42.090
<v Speaker 3>And she was super encouraging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

746
00:35:42.091 --> 00:35:43.770
<v Speaker 3>and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

747
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.230
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's what happened.</v>

748
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.010
<v Speaker 3>So what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>

749
00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:49.010
<v Speaker 3>You give her a call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you yellow,</v>

750
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:50.450
<v Speaker 3>the yellow thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

751
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Siri,</v>

752
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.060
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

753
00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:00.480
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually found this monastery through </v>

754
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.850
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine who was actually my </v>
<v Speaker 3>publisher and I went to a monastery with</v>

755
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.480
<v Speaker 3>eight monks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which already was a misconception for me</v>

756
00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:09.570
<v Speaker 3>because I thought monastery meant </v>
<v Speaker 3>community meant hundreds,</v>

757
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:15.110
<v Speaker 3>but there were eight months at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular monastery for which had been </v>

758
00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:15.110
<v Speaker 3>there for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

759
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.880
<v Speaker 3>And they lived on 500 acres in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>states,</v>

760
00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:22.881
<v Speaker 3>but in isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>500 acres and similar to what you're </v>

761
00:36:22.881 --> 00:36:23.130
<v Speaker 3>about to do in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in August or now.</v>

762
00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

763
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.790
<v Speaker 3>no phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no Internet,</v>

764
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.170
<v Speaker 3>no news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no this,</v>

765
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 3>no that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

766
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Speaker 3>and I just took 15 days to decompress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what was it like?</v>

767
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 3>So you get there day one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

768
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 3>what was the most shocking part I got </v>
<v Speaker 3>since you were a pretty open guy.</v>

769
00:36:39.451 --> 00:36:41.100
<v Speaker 3>So there was probably not much that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could shock you.</v>

770
00:36:41.101 --> 00:36:42.600
<v Speaker 3>But like what do they say?</v>

771
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.210
<v Speaker 3>Do they take all your stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

772
00:36:45.211 --> 00:36:47.370
<v Speaker 3>they were Russian Orthodox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't Buddhist.</v>

773
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 3>So like that era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

774
00:36:48.961 --> 00:36:53.961
<v Speaker 3>I had no expectation of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

775
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:58.080
<v Speaker 3>I walked into my room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they call a cell.</v>

776
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.200
<v Speaker 3>That's the rooms are called sales and </v>
<v Speaker 3>monastery and it was the size of this </v>

777
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 3>carpet like where we are and I had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bed,</v>

778
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:08.870
<v Speaker 3>one little desk with a light and brother</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christopher who is like my go to monk a </v>

779
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.940
<v Speaker 3>sat me down and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow at 7:00</v>

780
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.230
<v Speaker 3>AM,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll start with prayer,</v>

781
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.060
<v Speaker 3>reflect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reflection and meditation.</v>

782
00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:19.770
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

783
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.360
<v Speaker 3>it's 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM,</v>

784
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.600
<v Speaker 3>what do I do next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirteen hours.</v>

785
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.630
<v Speaker 3>And he looked at me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think?</v>

786
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.020
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

787
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.050
<v Speaker 3>And he left the room and I realized </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

788
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.810
<v Speaker 3>I can't call my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

789
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:41.930
<v Speaker 3>There's no books in my room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they had books but there are no </v>

790
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.930
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>

791
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.680
<v Speaker 3>There's no like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super like required.</v>

792
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.400
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

793
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to meditate.</v>

794
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Let me start the journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a TM,</v>

795
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.490
<v Speaker 3>transcendental meditation course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>set my timer for 20 minutes.</v>

796
00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:56.820
<v Speaker 3>I sat in my chair and I started to close</v>
<v Speaker 3>my eyes,</v>

797
00:37:56.821 --> 00:38:00.540
<v Speaker 3>focused on that mantra and I'm getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>bombarded.</v>

798
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am my kids,</v>

799
00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:02.480
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

800
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.160
<v Speaker 3>the hawks are going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do this?</v>

801
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Everything's going through my head and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we will talk about the hawks were done </v>

802
00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.110
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting and I'm going and I'm like,</v>

803
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.560
<v Speaker 3>why isn't my beeper beep because I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been here forever and I'm like,</v>

804
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.670
<v Speaker 3>I probably didn't start it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let me just keep going,</v>

805
00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:18.510
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And finally there's no beep.</v>

806
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:19.590
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

807
00:38:19.591 --> 00:38:22.440
<v Speaker 3>let me just reset my beeper and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>start over though.</v>

808
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I go back.</v>

809
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:24.780
<v Speaker 3>That will be cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

810
00:38:24.781 --> 00:38:26.910
<v Speaker 3>I in my chair forever and I finally </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

811
00:38:26.911 --> 00:38:31.911
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just let me reset this and start </v>

812
00:38:31.911 --> 00:38:31.911
<v Speaker 3>this again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I opened up my eyes.</v>

813
00:38:31.911 --> 00:38:33.870
<v Speaker 3>I looked at my time or three minutes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>27 seconds.</v>

814
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I calculated how many minutes I have</v>

815
00:38:38.201 --> 00:38:42.280
<v Speaker 3>left on the monastery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did 15 days,</v>

816
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:45.430
<v Speaker 3>times 24 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

817
00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.260
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just said to myself,</v>

818
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:52.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is great on paper in theory,</v>

819
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.680
<v Speaker 3>but this is gonna be fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just sat in my room and I was </v>

820
00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

821
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.580
<v Speaker 3>what did I get myself into?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you allowed to leave the room?</v>

822
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:07.450
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't leave the room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't leave the property.</v>

823
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:12.930
<v Speaker 3>This is the craziest situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the monks to keep the lights on at </v>

824
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 3>the monastery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they breed German shepherds.</v>

825
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:20.680
<v Speaker 3>So there were 11 adult German shepherds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight monks and nick.</v>

826
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:25.780
<v Speaker 3>So they're selling German shepherd </v>
<v Speaker 3>puppies and they trained dogs.</v>

827
00:39:25.781 --> 00:39:29.710
<v Speaker 3>They're world renown dog trainers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>world's,</v>

828
00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:34.711
<v Speaker 3>they've written books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've sold millions of copies of </v>

829
00:39:34.711 --> 00:39:34.711
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>

830
00:39:34.711 --> 00:39:36.700
<v Speaker 3>it's just a really unusual scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>

831
00:39:36.701 --> 00:39:40.180
<v Speaker 3>I could leave my cell and walk around </v>
<v Speaker 3>the monastery,</v>

832
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:42.280
<v Speaker 3>but first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 40 degrees outside.</v>

833
00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.340
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no lights.</v>

834
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:48.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like pitch dark at 4:00.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's freezing.</v>

835
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.230
<v Speaker 3>There's bear according to the monks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

836
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.700
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

837
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.700
<v Speaker 3>I really couldn't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean I just kinda like,</v>

838
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:59.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ended up walking 120 miles up and down</v>

839
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:04.350
<v Speaker 3>the driveway they had because I had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get some exercise over the course of my </v>

840
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:04.350
<v Speaker 3>journey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't,</v>

841
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 3>I didn't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

842
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just sat there and you know,</v>

843
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.670
<v Speaker 3>the first five days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five days was really,</v>

844
00:40:12.671 --> 00:40:17.671
<v Speaker 3>really difficult for me and I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately doing probably what I think </v>

845
00:40:18.251 --> 00:40:19.090
<v Speaker 3>most people do.</v>

846
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Certainly what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started giving myself an out.</v>

847
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.720
<v Speaker 3>I started justifying that it will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>okay to go home early,</v>

848
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.570
<v Speaker 3>just seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

849
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.030
<v Speaker 3>that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get out of here in seven days.</v>

850
00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.030
<v Speaker 3>No one's gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you didn't do whatever.</v>

851
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:38.610
<v Speaker 3>And I started creating all these excuses</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my head and I started thinking about </v>

852
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.300
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the goals do I have in areas of</v>

853
00:40:40.301 --> 00:40:43.900
<v Speaker 3>my life and my giving excuses in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

854
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:49.320
<v Speaker 3>and really started to like analyze </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that was going through my </v>

855
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.240
<v Speaker 3>head and put it into out the real my </v>
<v Speaker 3>real world.</v>

856
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.720
<v Speaker 3>And I just saw a lot of things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

857
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the,</v>

858
00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:00.720
<v Speaker 3>through just being quiet and alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did you break through that moment of</v>

859
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:05.730
<v Speaker 3>I can get away with seven days here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what was the actual thing that </v>

860
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:07.390
<v Speaker 3>turned down that I have a two words that</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed my life,</v>

861
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.920
<v Speaker 3>that I refer back to all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the.</v>

862
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.560
<v Speaker 3>When I wanted to go home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two words were like,</v>

863
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I signed up for 15 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

864
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:22.770
<v Speaker 3>that's what this goal was 15 days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day five when I really want to go home </v>

865
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:24.930
<v Speaker 3>and I missed my kids and I couldn't call</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

866
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two words are,</v>

867
00:41:26.591 --> 00:41:31.591
<v Speaker 3>remember tomorrow when you have a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>split second decision or a big major </v>

868
00:41:31.811 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 3>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

869
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.600
<v Speaker 3>how is that decision going to make you </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel tomorrow?</v>

870
00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:39.320
<v Speaker 3>So I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I drop out and quit now,</v>

871
00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.570
<v Speaker 3>the one time I'm going to do this in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

872
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.180
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to feel about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow when I get home?</v>

873
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 3>When someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how'd you do?</v>

874
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.490
<v Speaker 3>Did you make it terrible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

875
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 3>my legs are swollen at mile 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to drop out of the race.</v>

876
00:41:52.731 --> 00:41:57.731
<v Speaker 3>So the marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to come home the next </v>

877
00:41:57.731 --> 00:41:57.731
<v Speaker 3>day after the New York marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you finish?</v>

878
00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:02.950
<v Speaker 3>So remember tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just kind of said that to myself </v>

879
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:06.640
<v Speaker 3>over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just remember how you gonna feel </v>

880
00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.210
<v Speaker 3>about this and remember how proud you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to feel at the end of the journey.</v>

881
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.430
<v Speaker 3>And before I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife said,</v>

882
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:12.050
<v Speaker 3>don't leave until you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakthrough.</v>

883
00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:14.360
<v Speaker 3>You're broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

884
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:16.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm not broken and I haven't had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakthrough.</v>

885
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying,</v>

886
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.330
<v Speaker 2>so did you get broken or have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakthrough?</v>

887
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>

888
00:42:22.721 --> 00:42:27.721
<v Speaker 3>I actually know the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least the one that had some </v>

889
00:42:27.721 --> 00:42:28.750
<v Speaker 3>breakthroughs for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I never felt broken.</v>

890
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason I never felt broken </v>

891
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 3>is because it had a definitive end date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

892
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

893
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.170
<v Speaker 2>confer you would have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaving.</v>

894
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would it be like.</v>

895
00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have to really take me to a </v>

896
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:43.590
<v Speaker 3>place of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

897
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

898
00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean I had moments of being broken and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Sad.</v>

899
00:42:47.771 --> 00:42:49.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

900
00:42:49.331 --> 00:42:52.090
<v Speaker 3>like when you're away from everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't know what's going on,</v>

901
00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:58.020
<v Speaker 3>you just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know God on my kids getting </v>

902
00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:58.020
<v Speaker 3>bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is something happening?</v>

903
00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Is My wife okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

904
00:42:59.771 --> 00:43:04.771
<v Speaker 3>is the world in risk is just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you start to imagine that the </v>

905
00:43:07.331 --> 00:43:12.331
<v Speaker 3>world's going to end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain automatically goes to the </v>

906
00:43:12.331 --> 00:43:12.331
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't go to everything.</v>

907
00:43:12.331 --> 00:43:13.090
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

908
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:18.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should've been so much nicer to my </v>

909
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.071
<v Speaker 3>wife because I'm going to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not going to be home when I get </v>

910
00:43:20.071 --> 00:43:22.831
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you start sticking shit like that </v>

911
00:43:22.831 --> 00:43:25.770
<v Speaker 3>and then it just spirals because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have energy and space to think and </v>

912
00:43:26.891 --> 00:43:30.200
<v Speaker 3>imagine and dream and envision and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit that's like.</v>

913
00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:33.610
<v Speaker 3>It all comes to the surface and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

914
00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.970
<v Speaker 3>because it's in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're having a tough day,</v>

915
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:39.450
<v Speaker 3>you could say to Dave,</v>

918
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.270
<v Speaker 3>just fucking escape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you sit down,</v>

919
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:48.040
<v Speaker 3>you order Chinese food and you have your</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix and you'll watch it.</v>

920
00:43:48.041 --> 00:43:50.470
<v Speaker 3>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The issues don't go away.</v>

921
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:56.190
<v Speaker 3>When the movie's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Shit is still there on your to do </v>

922
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:59.461
<v Speaker 3>list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still there when I'm watching </v>

923
00:43:59.461 --> 00:44:00.110
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're still there and you know,</v>

924
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.440
<v Speaker 3>this forced you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no escape.</v>

925
00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.390
<v Speaker 3>This was your escape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it forced me to have to think through</v>

926
00:44:07.391 --> 00:44:08.710
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I got a lot of clarity.</v>

927
00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Although this is in no way comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I did my off the grid thing last </v>

928
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:15.400
<v Speaker 2>year and it for a week we were 10 days </v>
<v Speaker 2>or so.</v>

929
00:44:15.401 --> 00:44:18.190
<v Speaker 2>We were in Mexico and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just needed to do nothing.</v>

930
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.120
<v Speaker 2>I just needed to wake up every morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a light breakfast.</v>

931
00:44:22.121 --> 00:44:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I went to the gym and then I would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit.</v>

932
00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:28.580
<v Speaker 2>I got the same seat at the beach every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day and I would just sit and stare at </v>

933
00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.880
<v Speaker 2>the ocean for hours really for hours and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do try to do a little meditation and.</v>

934
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.560
<v Speaker 2>But I did have that moment at one point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was like,</v>

935
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:39.710
<v Speaker 2>anything could be happening right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>like world war three could be starting </v>

936
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 2>their terror attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Zombie apocalypse.</v>

937
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Like where you go to like the craziest </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

938
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:45.090
<v Speaker 2>And then I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

939
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:50.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go there for awhile and then I </v>

940
00:44:50.091 --> 00:44:50.091
<v Speaker 2>suddenly got to the end of it and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

941
00:44:50.091 --> 00:44:50.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing I can do about it right now.</v>

942
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:53.790
<v Speaker 2>So I better reset to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this better place.</v>

943
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.890
<v Speaker 2>And there's a real discipline in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

944
00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.200
<v Speaker 2>And how you can control your mind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts.</v>

945
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:03.410
<v Speaker 3>I think for sure the first three or four</v>
<v Speaker 3>days there I was obsessed with my to do </v>

946
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:07.941
<v Speaker 3>list and by day four or five I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a hurricane came and whisked my to do</v>

947
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 3>list into the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life goes on,</v>

948
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.350
<v Speaker 3>like I'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

949
00:45:16.351 --> 00:45:21.351
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like a captive to my to do list </v>

950
00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:21.530
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

951
00:45:21.531 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's my to do list for me,</v>

952
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:28.530
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even about finishing the tasks</v>
<v Speaker 3>as good as I could possibly do.</v>

953
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:30.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was about finishing up so I can keep.</v>

954
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:35.450
<v Speaker 3>It felt so good to cross them off that </v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it was 70 percent to what I </v>

955
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.470
<v Speaker 3>could probably do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go onto the next,</v>

956
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 3>onto the next,</v>
<v Speaker 3>onto the next,</v>

957
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.440
<v Speaker 3>at the monastery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The monks only had to do list.</v>

958
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:48.980
<v Speaker 3>There was no to do list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was whatever is in front of me is my </v>

959
00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:49.560
<v Speaker 3>task at hand.</v>

960
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 2>So tell me a little bit just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that day looks like.</v>

961
00:45:52.621 --> 00:45:55.760
<v Speaker 2>So you get up the next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's day to day said,</v>

962
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.240
<v Speaker 2>did you say 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM or 6:00</v>

963
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:57.900
<v Speaker 2>AM?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven am.</v>

964
00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:59.210
<v Speaker 2>And then prayer starts.</v>

965
00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:00.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would ring a big,</v>

966
00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:02.990
<v Speaker 3>a big like notre dame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Notre Dame.</v>

967
00:46:02.991 --> 00:46:07.640
<v Speaker 3>We like Church Val.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was right next to which was the,</v>

968
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:12.670
<v Speaker 3>which signaled to go to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the church where we would have a bad,</v>

969
00:46:13.671 --> 00:46:17.360
<v Speaker 3>an hour and a half service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which was meditation,</v>

970
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.910
<v Speaker 3>reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>

971
00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.240
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Religious in any way?</v>

972
00:46:22.241 --> 00:46:23.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were Russian Orthodox.</v>

973
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:24.860
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a religion,</v>

974
00:46:24.861 --> 00:46:29.180
<v Speaker 3>it was religious for me it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was peaceful,</v>

975
00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was definitely,</v>

976
00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.520
<v Speaker 3>definitely religious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

977
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:38.780
<v Speaker 3>and then we would shift to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breakfast which was traditionally </v>

978
00:46:38.991 --> 00:46:40.730
<v Speaker 3>silent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of those breakfast,</v>

979
00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:43.880
<v Speaker 3>the breakfast we're silent and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would go to,</v>

980
00:46:43.881 --> 00:46:48.881
<v Speaker 3>let's say nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 or 10 and afterwards there'll be a </v>

981
00:46:48.881 --> 00:46:51.500
<v Speaker 3>little bit of alone time and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would go to tasks and each of the months</v>

982
00:46:51.501 --> 00:46:55.520
<v Speaker 3>would have a different responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was just unbelievably efficient.</v>

983
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:58.820
<v Speaker 3>And I spent each day shadowing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different monks.</v>

984
00:46:58.821 --> 00:47:01.380
<v Speaker 3>So I got two rounds basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

985
00:47:01.381 --> 00:47:04.250
<v Speaker 3>and then there would be supper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dinner was lunchtime,</v>

986
00:47:04.251 --> 00:47:07.550
<v Speaker 3>so they flip flop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So breakfast was a really light meal,</v>

987
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:10.220
<v Speaker 3>which for me is just fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then lunch,</v>

988
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.080
<v Speaker 3>their lunch was dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be the big meal.</v>

989
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Rest or sleep away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Camp you go,</v>

990
00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.900
<v Speaker 3>the less time you will see us have more </v>
<v Speaker 3>labor,</v>

991
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.190
<v Speaker 3>which could be cleaning the church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something,</v>

992
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.140
<v Speaker 3>whatever the everyone's tasks were.</v>

993
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.460
<v Speaker 2>They always have stuff to do because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

994
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.920
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you think about it,</v>

995
00:47:26.921 --> 00:47:27.280
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

996
00:47:27.281 --> 00:47:29.830
<v Speaker 2>so eight guys living at this place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always stuff.</v>

997
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh it seems like there wouldn't be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more to do,</v>

998
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't want to know why.</v>

999
00:47:33.501 --> 00:47:34.900
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the toilet breaks,</v>

1000
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.270
<v Speaker 3>they don't call a plumber to fix the </v>
<v Speaker 3>toilet.</v>

1001
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:40.150
<v Speaker 3>They built the monastery by hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1002
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:42.220
<v Speaker 3>everything is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do everything.</v>

1003
00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:43.460
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well let's,</v>

1004
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.120
<v Speaker 3>let's get a swimming pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1005
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Get a shovel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a shovel and you get a shovel,</v>

1006
00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's figure out how to do it,</v>

1007
00:47:50.351 --> 00:47:54.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll build a swimming pool fees.</v>

1008
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 3>So they do probably hire you for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of jobs.</v>

1009
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a supervisor,</v>

1010
00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1011
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:05.020
<v Speaker 3>and then we would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was just more time alone.</v>

1012
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:06.970
<v Speaker 3>So there was a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1013
00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also a lot of work.</v>

1014
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.820
<v Speaker 3>So talk a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>disconnecting from technology.</v>

1015
00:48:12.821 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I get the concerns about your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your kids,</v>

1016
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

1017
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
<v Speaker 3>How did you feel about not putting your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand in your pocket to go to your phone </v>

1018
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.961
<v Speaker 3>or not having an ipad right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you or television screen or the rest of </v>

1019
00:48:24.961 --> 00:48:24.961
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1020
00:48:24.961 --> 00:48:26.740
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because when I got back </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody asks me,</v>

1021
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you miss?</v>

1022
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:30.610
<v Speaker 3>The obvious answers I missed my family </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this and that,</v>

1023
00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:33.280
<v Speaker 3>but no one ever asked me what didn't you</v>
<v Speaker 3>miss?</v>

1024
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 3>And when I didn't miss at all were </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I do everyday that I thought</v>

1025
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:41.020
<v Speaker 3>I would miss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

1026
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I went during the NCAA tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't miss not watching March </v>

1027
00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.140
<v Speaker 3>madness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been a pivot,</v>

1028
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:52.320
<v Speaker 3>been something I've loved to do forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I calculated how many hours of </v>

1029
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.060
<v Speaker 3>basketball I've watched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1030
00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:56.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably years of my life,</v>

1031
00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.460
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't miss it and I didn't miss </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting like that,</v>

1032
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liking my friend's picture and can Kuhn </v>

1033
00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:04.520
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1034
00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:04.520
<v Speaker 3>with a corona.</v>

1035
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:09.540
<v Speaker 3>I didn't miss any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't miss going through Hulu and </v>

1036
00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Netflix and debating with my wife what </v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch and I realized I spent a lot of</v>

1037
00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:15.280
<v Speaker 3>time on things that I really didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>miss.</v>

1038
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:21.360
<v Speaker 3>And if I eliminated some of those I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would freed up a lot more time to spend </v>

1039
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.570
<v Speaker 3>to do the things I love to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people I love to do them with.</v>

1040
00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1041
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 3>but it was so comfortable with my phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>is always in my hand.</v>

1042
00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.380
<v Speaker 3>It was hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1043
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.820
<v Speaker 3>Really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took,</v>

1044
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:35.850
<v Speaker 3>it took a long time to get past that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you feel that there was like a </v>

1045
00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:36.430
<v Speaker 3>little bit of a learning curve with it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I did it and as I said,</v>

1046
00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:41.431
<v Speaker 3>I locked my phone and a safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not know the code and I found it </v>

1047
00:49:41.431 --> 00:49:41.800
<v Speaker 3>for the first day or two.</v>

1048
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.230
<v Speaker 3>I kept going in my pocket even at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beach,</v>

1049
00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:46.150
<v Speaker 3>like I'm just going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing in my pocket.</v>

1050
00:49:46.151 --> 00:49:47.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think my shorts had </v>
<v Speaker 3>pockets,</v>

1051
00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:48.730
<v Speaker 3>so I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go like this.</v>

1052
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:50.930
<v Speaker 3>And then there's like this weird anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like,</v>

1053
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.350
<v Speaker 3>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did I miss is the Zombie apocalypse</v>

1054
00:49:53.351 --> 00:49:56.830
<v Speaker 3>or the war started or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then suddenly by day like five,</v>

1055
00:49:56.831 --> 00:49:59.860
<v Speaker 3>I kind of felt empowered by day eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1056
00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:04.890
<v Speaker 3>I want nothing to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then maybe there's a little bit of like </v>

1057
00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:05.560
<v Speaker 3>a return to a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be okay.</v>

1058
00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I'll manage it differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you go through all of the exact,</v>

1059
00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:12.090
<v Speaker 3>the exact steps that you just mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the exact timeframe you just,</v>

1060
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:18.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I got to the point where I didn't </v>

1061
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.481
<v Speaker 3>miss it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the habit of checking before I </v>

1062
00:50:21.481 --> 00:50:24.601
<v Speaker 3>went to bed or waking up at five in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning and seeing anything new come in </v>

1063
00:50:24.601 --> 00:50:24.601
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1064
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.710
<v Speaker 3>once I got past that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1065
00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't miss it.</v>

1066
00:50:29.181 --> 00:50:31.390
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1067
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.150
<v Speaker 3>and once I got home and I put on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>news and read,</v>

1068
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:40.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's going on in the world and </v>

1069
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.270
<v Speaker 3>all the negative stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just like,</v>

1070
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.750
<v Speaker 3>ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here I am,</v>

1071
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 3>I've been home and now I'm back on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone and I came home.</v>

1072
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:47.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm off email and then you know,</v>

1073
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.580
<v Speaker 3>but you drift back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1074
00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:54.830
<v Speaker 2>have you been able to put any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just personal policies in place to </v>

1075
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:56.010
<v Speaker 2>manage this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm still trying.</v>

1076
00:50:56.011 --> 00:50:58.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't do phone and bedroom 90 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the nights.</v>

1077
00:50:58.741 --> 00:51:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Every now and again it just somehow ends</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>

1078
00:51:00.601 --> 00:51:02.790
<v Speaker 2>But like that's one for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that at 5:00</v>

1079
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.980
<v Speaker 2>AM I just</v>

1080
00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:06.300
<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been the obvious ones,</v>

1081
00:51:06.301 --> 00:51:06.860
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1082
00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:09.390
<v Speaker 3>not in the bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at meal time,</v>

1083
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:14.630
<v Speaker 3>not in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm and I used to sit and movies and I </v>

1084
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:15.990
<v Speaker 3>heard a ding or a beep or a buzz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go into my shirt,</v>

1085
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.290
<v Speaker 3>looked like the light to look under </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1086
00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.060
<v Speaker 3>but now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's.</v>

1087
00:51:21.061 --> 00:51:26.061
<v Speaker 3>So I became this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this will summarize my </v>

1088
00:51:26.061 --> 00:51:30.141
<v Speaker 3>experience the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a retreat at the monastery and </v>

1089
00:51:30.141 --> 00:51:31.620
<v Speaker 3>they had all these guests and the guests</v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

1090
00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:32.880
<v Speaker 3>They said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesse,</v>

1091
00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:36.120
<v Speaker 3>you're going to clean up all the dishes </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

1092
00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.450
<v Speaker 3>like the rookie on the team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1093
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:42.780
<v Speaker 3>There's 500 dishes stacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started cleaning the dishes and I'm</v>

1094
00:51:42.781 --> 00:51:47.781
<v Speaker 3>drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in cleaning up and drying them and </v>

1095
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:47.940
<v Speaker 3>they go and they bring more in and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned to them.</v>

1096
00:51:47.941 --> 00:51:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to take me forever.</v>

1097
00:51:49.501 --> 00:51:53.070
<v Speaker 3>How am I going to do all these dishes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the monks certainly goes,</v>

1098
00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:58.310
<v Speaker 3>there's not all those dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only the dish that's in your </v>

1099
00:51:58.310 --> 00:51:59.400
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1100
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:04.760
<v Speaker 3>it reminded me that I'm never wearing my</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet are and I got to be where my feet </v>

1101
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.790
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1102
00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.020
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm doing.</v>

1103
00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something there because I do </v>

1104
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:12.090
<v Speaker 2>find that I actually liked doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dishes.</v>

1105
00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a little nuts and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it for.</v>

1106
00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it for 500 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do find it's like one of like,</v>

1107
00:52:17.251 --> 00:52:19.950
<v Speaker 2>I can't have my phone in my hand while </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing the dishes.</v>

1108
00:52:19.951 --> 00:52:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1109
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.940
<v Speaker 2>it's one little thing that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

1110
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.740
<v Speaker 2>So I do find on these brief moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1111
00:52:25.741 --> 00:52:26.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1112
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm on tour right now and it's like when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this,</v>

1113
00:52:27.871 --> 00:52:31.620
<v Speaker 2>when I have these brief moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like doing very menial.</v>

1114
00:52:31.621 --> 00:52:36.621
<v Speaker 2>Like I really like gardening or just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like cleaning up outside or like these </v>

1115
00:52:36.621 --> 00:52:40.341
<v Speaker 2>things that aren't much because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to have this incredible importance.</v>

1116
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:45.670
<v Speaker 3>We've lost touch with a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that help us feel connected.</v>

1117
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we have no connection to our food.</v>

1118
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:53.490
<v Speaker 3>We go to a supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't know unless you live on a </v>

1119
00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:55.741
<v Speaker 3>farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're very disconnected from a lot </v>

1120
00:52:55.741 --> 00:52:58.681
<v Speaker 3>of things that make us tick and simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that bring us back down to </v>

1121
00:52:58.681 --> 00:53:02.050
<v Speaker 3>earth and they ground us and I felt the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same way.</v>

1122
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:07.110
<v Speaker 3>I felt up as a contributor even if it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>contributing to your own household,</v>

1123
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.390
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as opposed to having someone to come</v>

1124
00:53:10.391 --> 00:53:12.970
<v Speaker 3>in and clean it or however you guys do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it or whatever.</v>

1125
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes you feel connected.</v>

1126
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Important part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1127
00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.720
<v Speaker 3>it creates momentum and winds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't explain it,</v>

1128
00:53:22.721 --> 00:53:25.350
<v Speaker 3>but I felt the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

1129
00:53:25.351 --> 00:53:27.350
<v Speaker 3>I was volunteering for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 3>There's real value in that.</v>

1131
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Like even when you came into my house </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

1132
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:31.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so great here and this and that.</v>

1133
00:53:31.241 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 3>And it's like I really love like we put </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of effort into like I want to like</v>

1134
00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:40.161
<v Speaker 3>wake up in the place that I want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>at and like make it better and make it </v>

1135
00:53:40.161 --> 00:53:41.910
<v Speaker 3>more valuable than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for the average person that can maybe</v>

1136
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:46.020
<v Speaker 3>take a month to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the piece of advice?</v>

1137
00:53:46.021 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Or is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can people do a weekend with monks?</v>

1138
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you just do a day with me?</v>

1139
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I think it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

1140
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.070
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think anyone could spend time alone.</v>

1141
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think spending time alone and you </v>

1142
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.621
<v Speaker 3>reckon I recognize like I don't spend </v>
<v Speaker 3>any time alone other than going for </v>

1143
00:54:00.621 --> 00:54:00.621
<v Speaker 3>runs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1144
00:54:00.621 --> 00:54:05.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's really important </v>

1145
00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.371
<v Speaker 3>because I think the only way you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>really be in tune with your gut is to </v>

1146
00:54:07.371 --> 00:54:08.010
<v Speaker 3>spend some time alone.</v>

1147
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for me,</v>

1148
00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 3>I carry a lot of stuff in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized that I need to,</v>

1149
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 3>like I put everything on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I get out of my head,</v>

1150
00:54:16.261 --> 00:54:19.140
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it frees up space.</v>

1151
00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:23.340
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of space and creative energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the monastery because I didn't have,</v>

1152
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't cluttered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I have a two journal system that </v>

1153
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very simple.</v>

1154
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:29.970
<v Speaker 3>I dumped everything into one big </v>
<v Speaker 3>journal.</v>

1155
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's out of my head.</v>

1156
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to remember I to get a kid </v>

1157
00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:38.961
<v Speaker 3>at birthday present or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I make my daily kind of routine</v>

1158
00:54:39.321 --> 00:54:40.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1159
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:42.480
<v Speaker 3>and this kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1160
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think just being really aware of where</v>

1161
00:54:45.301 --> 00:54:49.680
<v Speaker 3>your feet are is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the monks are Mano taskers.</v>

1162
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.730
<v Speaker 3>I live in a world of multitasking and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that,</v>

1163
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the everyday,</v>

1164
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.220
<v Speaker 3>for everybody I think that feels </v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed or feel,</v>

1165
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:03.410
<v Speaker 3>feels distracted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to do one thing at a time and do it </v>

1166
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:07.911
<v Speaker 3>well and move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been back to the monastery </v>

1167
00:55:07.911 --> 00:55:07.911
<v Speaker 3>since?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go.</v>

1168
00:55:07.911 --> 00:55:12.471
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not planning on going to go back </v>

1169
00:55:12.471 --> 00:55:12.740
<v Speaker 3>to partake again or is it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you go like,</v>

1170
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:17.780
<v Speaker 3>have lunch with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least just for some high fives I met </v>

1171
00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:17.780
<v Speaker 3>like they're down for that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1172
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Like the for some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1173
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.660
<v Speaker 3>for some high fives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you'll figure it out.</v>

1174
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was like an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came here,</v>

1175
00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:25.450
<v Speaker 3>I was full of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1176
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:26.400
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're.</v>

1177
00:55:26.401 --> 00:55:27.580
<v Speaker 3>What are we running?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they,</v>

1178
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:29.580
<v Speaker 3>did they have any idea of your history </v>
<v Speaker 3>or just,</v>

1179
00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:31.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your success is any of that stuff.</v>

1180
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:34.290
<v Speaker 3>They just think it's just some guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1181
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 3>we're letting in on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

1182
00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:37.680
<v Speaker 3>That must've been pretty cool in and of </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

1183
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:40.890
<v Speaker 3>I remember very clearly sitting down and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was telling him about my journey.</v>

1184
00:55:40.891 --> 00:55:43.620
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about coconut water and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they all looked at me and said,</v>

1185
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:44.860
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1186
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:48.450
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about the Atlanta Hawks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of them raised their hand,</v>

1187
00:55:48.451 --> 00:55:51.390
<v Speaker 3>said I went to an expos game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well in Montreal,</v>

1188
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:53.980
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's baseball anymore.</v>

1189
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1190
00:55:56.911 --> 00:56:01.911
<v Speaker 3>well for our last few minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about the hawks for a second </v>

1191
00:56:01.911 --> 00:56:02.940
<v Speaker 3>and just own you own a basketball team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which to me is,</v>

1192
00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:04.320
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love basketball.</v>

1193
00:56:04.321 --> 00:56:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Like that's like the greatest thing on </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

1194
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:12.100
<v Speaker 3>I would probably stop doing all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would trade it in to own a basketball </v>

1195
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:12.100
<v Speaker 3>team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1196
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the principal owner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1197
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:20.150
<v Speaker 3>we got a great group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for me living in Atlanta as a </v>

1198
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:23.421
<v Speaker 3>basketball fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a season ticket holder for years </v>

1199
00:56:23.421 --> 00:56:23.421
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

1200
00:56:23.421 --> 00:56:27.440
<v Speaker 3>And then I was a consultant to the team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got to fall in love with the </v>

1201
00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.111
<v Speaker 3>players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coaching staff management first and </v>

1202
00:56:31.111 --> 00:56:33.130
<v Speaker 3>now it'd be part of the ownership group </v>
<v Speaker 3>with my wife and friends.</v>

1203
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:37.870
<v Speaker 3>It's a in a city that I live in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a team that I love.</v>

1204
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1205
00:56:39.221 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just unbelievable.</v>

1206
00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.390
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to my wife the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1207
00:56:43.391 --> 00:56:48.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from my father and my family and my </v>

1208
00:56:48.391 --> 00:56:51.181
<v Speaker 3>friends and the city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 80 plus games a year where I </v>

1209
00:56:51.181 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 3>could put the tea nights a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could put the TV on,</v>

1210
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:58.150
<v Speaker 3>thinking about you as a knick fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiply it by 20 and just,</v>

1211
00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:58.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

1212
00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:04.040
<v Speaker 3>and just really love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's been super exciting and I think </v>

1213
00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:08.791
<v Speaker 3>we've got a really bright future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm looking forward to the next </v>

1214
00:57:08.791 --> 00:57:08.791
<v Speaker 3>couple of years.</v>

1215
00:57:08.791 --> 00:57:10.050
<v Speaker 2>I know it was a little before your time </v>
<v Speaker 2>of owning the hawks,</v>

1216
00:57:10.051 --> 00:57:12.120
<v Speaker 2>but how is Dominique Wilkins not in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hall of fame?</v>

1217
00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:15.880
<v Speaker 3>I love Nick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's that kind of the whole thing?</v>

1218
00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:19.150
<v Speaker 3>He deserves to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He deserves to be.</v>

1219
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:22.600
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only is he great basketball player,</v>

1220
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:24.910
<v Speaker 3>but he's in Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1221
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:26.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just a big part of the,</v>

1222
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:30.100
<v Speaker 3>of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's part of the state does the play,</v>

1223
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:31.330
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1224
00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:36.720
<v Speaker 3>he was at every game site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen him say no to a photo or </v>

1225
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.550
<v Speaker 3>an autograph ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never just,</v>

1226
00:57:39.551 --> 00:57:41.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he makes people feel really good.</v>

1227
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:44.110
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's very approachable.</v>

1228
00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:49.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you guys doing over there to </v>

1229
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:49.280

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.750
<v Speaker 2>bring all of the things that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about here into the game and make</v>

1231
00:57:50.751 --> 00:57:55.100
<v Speaker 2>it fun and add some of the other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not part of the 48 minutes?</v>

1232
00:57:55.101 --> 00:57:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.260
<v Speaker 2>the go New York go thing.</v>

1234
00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:02.360
<v Speaker 3>I think there's several buckets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the internal bucket and Tony </v>

1235
00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.480
<v Speaker 3>Wrestlers the principal on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's done an amazing job of just,</v>

1236
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:06.300
<v Speaker 3>we have a new practice facility that </v>
<v Speaker 3>state of the art best,</v>

1237
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:08.830
<v Speaker 3>probably one of the best in the MBA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1238
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.190
<v Speaker 3>we're renovating the arena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Massive,</v>

1239
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.970
<v Speaker 3>multi hundred million dollar renovation </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going on now.</v>

1240
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:20.270
<v Speaker 3>So there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the internal stuff and then </v>

1241
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.820
<v Speaker 3>there's the game presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many layers.</v>

1242
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:26.180
<v Speaker 3>Game presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the actual basketball side of </v>

1243
00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:26.850
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the nights that the,</v>

1244
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:31.910
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the team doesn't play that the </v>

1245
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.910
<v Speaker 3>arena is available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a concert,</v>

1246
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many layers of it,</v>

1247
00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:38.420
<v Speaker 3>but I think at the end of the day it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>said that enthusiasm and passion and </v>

1248
00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:43.281
<v Speaker 3>just bringing whatever you can to infuse</v>
<v Speaker 3>a culture of think of your emotional </v>

1249
00:58:43.291 --> 00:58:48.291
<v Speaker 3>connection to the next and the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing you said to me when I walked in </v>

1250
00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:50.160
<v Speaker 3>and you took me to 94 games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember those.</v>

1251
00:58:50.161 --> 00:58:52.260
<v Speaker 3>I remember where I was sitting for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain games.</v>

1252
00:58:52.261 --> 00:58:54.690
<v Speaker 3>You know what you're eating and when he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five years ago,</v>

1253
00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what I ate last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1254
00:58:57.590 --> 00:59:02.590
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just so much emotion and if we </v>

1255
00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:06.561
<v Speaker 3>could bring that same passion to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>community and marry that with the </v>

1256
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Atlanta Hawks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna be super powerful and I </v>

1257
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.530
