1
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.003
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we consistently talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about here at the Rubin report is why </v>

2
00:00:08.021 --> 00:00:11.350
<v Speaker 1>it's important to judge people as </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals and not as a collective.</v>

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.213
<v Speaker 1>You as an individual are much more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>your immutable characteristics be at </v>

4
00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>your skin color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your religion or your sexuality to judge</v>

5
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:23.770
<v Speaker 1>you on those characteristics is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the essence of prejudice really is.</v>

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.843
<v Speaker 1>Prejudice of course means to prejudge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you look at a black person or a </v>

7
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Muslim person or a gay person and think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know what they think,</v>

8
00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 1>or more importantly how they should </v>
<v Speaker 1>think based on those characteristics,</v>

9
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.220
<v Speaker 1>then you are actually the one who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being prejudiced.</v>

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.563
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the people who accuse others of </v>

11
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:42.904
<v Speaker 1>bigotry and racism these days are often </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who practice this brand of </v>

12
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:49.990
<v Speaker 1>prejudice the most without even </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing that they're doing so.</v>

13
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Just look at some of the things that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends Larry elder,</v>

14
00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>my [inaudible] and Ion Hirsi Ali or </v>
<v Speaker 1>called by the so called tolerance side.</v>

15
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.863
<v Speaker 1>When you look at a group of people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you know what they should </v>

16
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.463
<v Speaker 1>think or what's best for them based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>those outward characteristics and now </v>

17
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:06.724
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in their own minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You not only lock people into your </v>

18
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:10.744
<v Speaker 1>preconceived notions of what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but stifle the voices of the minorities </v>

19
00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:15.844
<v Speaker 1>within these minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why the voices of black </v>

20
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>conservatives and gay Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

21
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:25.210
<v Speaker 1>are so relevant and interesting today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really listen to these minorities</v>

22
00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:26.044
<v Speaker 1>within the minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will judge these people on their </v>

23
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their logic,</v>

24
00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:33.790
<v Speaker 1>and their reason instead of simply how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they look or who they love.</v>

25
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.923
<v Speaker 1>In a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very existence of BS freethinkers </v>

26
00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 1>within these minority communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flips identity politics on its head,</v>

27
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.740
<v Speaker 1>showing the flaws of this postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>intersectional way of thinking.</v>

28
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.993
<v Speaker 1>Just see how quickly those who preach </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics turn on black or </v>

29
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:49.714
<v Speaker 1>Latino people who have conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>political beliefs or how easily they </v>

30
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:54.004
<v Speaker 1>dismiss gays are women who dare talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how poorly they're treated in </v>

31
00:01:57.521 --> 00:01:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Islamic societies.</v>

32
00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.913
<v Speaker 1>Identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politics only works if you believe that </v>

33
00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:02.884
<v Speaker 1>the most important quality about each of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us are the attributes which we are born </v>

34
00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>with thus cannot change rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas which we come to learn.</v>

35
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.063
<v Speaker 1>I view this twisted ideology as a true </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential danger for the tolerant and </v>

36
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:16.954
<v Speaker 1>Liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>albeit flawed country that America is </v>

37
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.463
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jr's desire for his children to be </v>

38
00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:26.890
<v Speaker 1>judged by the content of their character</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not the color of their skin is being</v>

39
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:30.790
<v Speaker 1>undermined by the very people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>purport to be the tolerant ones.</v>

40
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.403
<v Speaker 1>We're continuing our partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn liberty today and joining me is </v>

41
00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:37.270
<v Speaker 1>the CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fund,</v>

42
00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:38.104
<v Speaker 1>Johnny c Dot Taylor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The organization represents nearly </v>

43
00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:41.134
<v Speaker 1>300,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>students who attend the 47 historical </v>

44
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:44.854
<v Speaker 1>black colleges in America today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard Johnny speak at an event in </v>

45
00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Dallas a couple months ago and was blown</v>
<v Speaker 1>away by his passion,</v>

46
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.933
<v Speaker 1>his commitment to educating young people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his desire to move past identity </v>

47
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:58.210
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about politics,</v>

48
00:02:58.211 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and much.</v>

49
00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Has</v>

50
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v Speaker 2>the role of the Black College changed as</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've become a more fair injustice </v>

51
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.693
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just one of the many questions </v>

52
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask johnny and I'll only judge him </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the content of his answers,</v>

53
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>not the color of his skin.</v>

54
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.643
<v Speaker 1>We're continuing our partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn liberty today and joining me is </v>

55
00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>the president and CEO of the Thurgood </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marshall Scholarship Fund,</v>

56
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:28.310
<v Speaker 1>but the only national organization </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing the nearly 300,000</v>

57
00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:32.720
<v Speaker 1>students attending America's 47 </v>
<v Speaker 1>historically black colleges.</v>

58
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Johnny c Dot Taylor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

59
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.280
<v Speaker 1>So glad to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta tell you man,</v>

60
00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I and I just did tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I'll repeat it.</v>

61
00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:40.094
<v Speaker 1>Since the cameras are on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been doing this thing with learn </v>

62
00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:42.674
<v Speaker 1>liberty for a little over a year or so </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've sent us some great authors </v>

63
00:03:45.561 --> 00:03:48.960
<v Speaker 1>and professors and thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never requested anyone.</v>

64
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.963
<v Speaker 1>User are the first person I requested </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I saw you speak a couple of </v>

65
00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:56.210
<v Speaker 1>months back at a conference for </v>
<v Speaker 1>academics.</v>

66
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:57.044
<v Speaker 1>Had to do a lot about free speech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty and all sorts of things and you </v>

67
00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:02.870
<v Speaker 1>gave the keynote address on the final </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and I thought,</v>

68
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>this guy is possibly the most passionate</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker I've ever seen in my life.</v>

69
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that passion come from?</v>

70
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start there.</v>

71
00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Before we even talking about what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

72
00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:16.580
<v Speaker 1>just the passion that you had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like that.</v>

73
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I got to get that guy on the show.</v>

74
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.930
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

75
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I spent my career in the entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

76
00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:24.330
<v Speaker 2>the media space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paramount pictures,</v>

77
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:25.470
<v Speaker 2>spelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment,</v>

78
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:29.370
<v Speaker 2>blockbuster entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of my life was doing that kind of</v>

79
00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:30.270
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making money,</v>

80
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.983
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I always had this yearning for the </v>

81
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 2>community and how higher education could</v>
<v Speaker 2>play into him.</v>

82
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.910
<v Speaker 2>Sort of fixing what was going on in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

83
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.430
<v Speaker 2>And I say the community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of Americans,</v>

84
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:45.264
<v Speaker 2>but particularly African Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were so many conversations </v>

85
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:51.480
<v Speaker 2>that didn't occur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't allowed to occur.</v>

86
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.583
<v Speaker 2>And so I took this new role at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thurgood Marshall College Fund </v>

87
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.660
<v Speaker 2>representing Black Colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't attend a black college.</v>

88
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.643
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I often say I'm a beneficiary of it </v>

89
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.120
<v Speaker 2>because so many of my teachers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors and lawyers did,</v>

90
00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:03.954
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents didn't attend a black </v>

91
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:06.024
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought this was such an </v>

92
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:11.990
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to come in and really begin </v>
<v Speaker 2>to influence how young people are,</v>

93
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.853
<v Speaker 2>our future leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they think about the world and then </v>

94
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:18.630
<v Speaker 2>to challenge them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My legal education by definition sort of</v>

95
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:19.464
<v Speaker 2>taught me to challenge the status quo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to argue both sides or in </v>

96
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.540
<v Speaker 2>some instances three sides of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

97
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.720
<v Speaker 2>And so that's where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

98
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.643
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't sleep at night sometimes </v>

99
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 2>thinking about where America is headed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where the passion comes from.</v>

100
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm genuinely concerned about where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going.</v>

101
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that too.</v>

102
00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:39.734
<v Speaker 1>And we kind of hit that a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and now we've got to do it all </v>

103
00:05:41.671 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>over right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

104
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 1>tell me a little bit more about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>resume before we get to what you've been</v>

105
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:48.420
<v Speaker 1>doing these last couple of years because</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

106
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:49.620
<v Speaker 1>you just mentioned some of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like eight pages that God is good.</v>

109
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>But tell a little bit about that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

110
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 2>think it does form Sorta,</v>

00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:10.750
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

117
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 2>in any event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finished school,</v>

118
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 2>went to law school in Iowa at Drake </v>
<v Speaker 2>University.</v>

119
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I came back to south Florida to practice</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a big law firm.</v>

120
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Janet Reno was one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the first female partner.</v>

121
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 2>So I'm dating myself and takes your way </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

122
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 2>And then began my practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat on a plane one day,</v>

123
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 2>melt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>met A.</v>

124
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.670
<v Speaker 2>I did not know at the time of </v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaire Wayne Highs,</v>

125
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Zynga who had this small little business</v>
<v Speaker 2>called blockbuster that he was building.</v>

126
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:34.574
<v Speaker 2>I went in as the third lawyer on staff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and literally we went through this huge </v>

127
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:38.924
<v Speaker 2>acquisition spree and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember blockbuster was on every </v>

128
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

129
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.240
<v Speaker 2>It's the biggest so did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Viacom bought us,</v>

130
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.103
<v Speaker 2>so I've spent my time as a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an hr executive and then ultimately </v>

131
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 2>once by combat us and worked for sumner </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Viacom,</v>

132
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Sumner Redstone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then uh,</v>

133
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 2>my last corporate gig was running a </v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

134
00:06:57.081 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 2>a subsidiary for Barry Diller in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>

135
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:00.284
<v Speaker 2>So I literally have had all of the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>office functions and then ran frontline </v>

136
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:08.981
<v Speaker 2>operator running a business for Barry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to TMC in 2010 as the CEO.</v>

137
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 2>So you've been doing this for now about </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven years and you're actually about to</v>

138
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 2>shift into something else which will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will get to a little later,</v>

139
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 2>but tell me a little bit about what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarship climb to actually does.</v>

140
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:22.184
<v Speaker 2>What is the purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know a certain amount of </v>

141
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:24.404
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know a lot of your thoughts </v>

142
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:25.934
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the diversity memo and all that </v>

143
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

144
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 2>It almost sounds counter to what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund might</v>

145
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

146
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the college fund was actually created by</v>

147
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:35.744
<v Speaker 2>the way we were created as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scholarship Fund Thurgood Marshall </v>

148
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Scholarship Fund about a decade ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We changed the name to broaden the remit</v>

149
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.763
<v Speaker 2>to the college funds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's Thurgood Marshall College Fund </v>

150
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 2>and we really only do four things </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarships.</v>

151
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 2>We provide scholarships for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely most talented students,</v>

152
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 2>so this is not sort of a social services</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel good for kids who didn't get a shot</v>

153
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.080
<v Speaker 2>k through 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the brightest kids who frankly</v>

154
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:00.914
<v Speaker 2>just have money problems they need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so scholarships that are needing and </v>

155
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 2>sort of need and merit based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then capacity building.</v>

156
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.910
<v Speaker 2>We've talked with our schools a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

157
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 2>There was a time when HPC use captive </v>
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

158
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:15.110
<v Speaker 2>If you were black and you want to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>

159
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 2>you attended a black college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

160
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 2>everything changed.</v>

161
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Be careful what you pray for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We asked for diversity,</v>

162
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 2>we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We asked her integration,</v>

163
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:23.174
<v Speaker 2>we got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so now black students have options </v>

164
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.873
<v Speaker 2>and so black colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>historically black colleges have got to </v>

165
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:28.814
<v Speaker 2>step up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the second thing is to build their </v>

166
00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:30.914
<v Speaker 2>capacity to be attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The third thing that we do as </v>

167
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 2>governmental affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of abic advocacy and policy</v>

168
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 2>work to make sure that we're not making </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional decisions.</v>

169
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:40.184
<v Speaker 2>We want to do what is good for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities and what's good for this </v>

170
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:43.814
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are really the three things that </v>

171
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 2>we focus on as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a fund and that's the work that we do</v>

172
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.983
<v Speaker 2>and the thing that most of the folks </v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly don't realize is historically </v>

173
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 2>black colleges are not ebc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not exclusively black colleges.</v>

174
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for currently four of our member schools</v>

175
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 2>are majority white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really majority white.</v>

176
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:04.893
<v Speaker 2>So they are still historically black </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges because the hbcus historically </v>

177
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily currently blank.</v>

178
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 2>So West Virginia State and Bluefield </v>
<v Speaker 2>State College,</v>

179
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 2>both in West Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln University in Missouri,</v>

180
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky State,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

181
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 2>these are schools that while technically</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not technically are actually hpc use</v>

182
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.013
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have more white students than black </v>

183
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:25.764
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are some of the things that </v>

184
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.960
<v Speaker 2>people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not about race per se.</v>

185
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.433
<v Speaker 2>How much battling is there over what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means to be historically black versus </v>

186
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.730
<v Speaker 2>currently diverse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I would imagine you've got,</v>

187
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and academics and administrators </v>

188
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 2>who were probably pretty entrenched in </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping things,</v>

189
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:44.874
<v Speaker 2>just looking at it by numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily diversity of thought </v>

190
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.993
<v Speaker 2>that's and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you must be dealing with that </v>

191
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:49.291
<v Speaker 2>constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

192
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea.</v>

193
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.453
<v Speaker 2>That's ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting because I'm </v>

194
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:57.204
<v Speaker 2>surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know we'll talk about some of </v>

195
00:09:58.501 --> 00:09:59.334
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm surprised at the number you'd </v>

196
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:01.650
<v Speaker 2>like to think millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:02.484
<v Speaker 2>we think millennials and we group them </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and they're open and they're diverse </v>

198
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:05.910
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

199
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I was surprised we've had some students </v>
<v Speaker 2>really not faculty,</v>

200
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 2>not alumni,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but students,</v>

201
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:12.384
<v Speaker 2>18 or 19 year olds take great issue with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the institutions are more </v>

202
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:17.244
<v Speaker 2>diverse than they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to come to an all black </v>

203
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.273
<v Speaker 2>institution and we get there and realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have international students and </v>

204
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 2>white students and Hispanic students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really push back.</v>

205
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 2>So that's been a real surprise to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you break through that?</v>

206
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you continue.</v>

207
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:31.914
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you explained to them that Hbcu is not </v>

208
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:34.344
<v Speaker 2>ABC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you start with that and you also </v>

209
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:36.714
<v Speaker 2>then explain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find myself oftentimes when I'm </v>

210
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:39.684
<v Speaker 2>talking to them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just put yourself in this </v>

211
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just recently one of our campuses,</v>

212
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.383
<v Speaker 2>one of a group of students were really </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset because in fact it was all over </v>

213
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:49.014
<v Speaker 2>the national news about students came on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the campus of Howard University wearing </v>

214
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:53.400
<v Speaker 2>the make America great again.</v>

215
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.290
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

216
00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted the student leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pulled to the sadness.</v>

217
00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:00.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to just for a second to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask me,</v>

218
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:01.374
<v Speaker 2>how do you think this would play out </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of black students right after </v>

219
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Obama elected go visit Liberty </v>
<v Speaker 2>University's campus.</v>

220
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.433
<v Speaker 2>They have on the wonderful Obama tee </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirts where they're proud of this new </v>

221
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:12.930
<v Speaker 2>president and they were literally run </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of campus.</v>

222
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:15.270
<v Speaker 2>They were threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were harassed.</v>

223
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.283
<v Speaker 2>How do you think that will go over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I find myself doing is she </v>

224
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.423
<v Speaker 2>just literally put yourself in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and tell me why this is that </v>

225
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.980
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

226
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 2>and then you get that pause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that moment.</v>

227
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.363
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what motivates me to do my work </v>

228
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:31.494
<v Speaker 2>because that's the way you influence the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the narrative and how these </v>

229
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:36.630
<v Speaker 2>young people think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to just stop and say,</v>

230
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I get how you feel right now emotionally</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>

231
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.523
<v Speaker 2>but for just a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's flip the script and tell me how </v>

232
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:43.854
<v Speaker 2>this works.</v>

233
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.510
<v Speaker 2>And you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're bright.</v>

234
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.003
<v Speaker 2>Tell me how this works out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really part of what motivates me </v>

235
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:50.780
<v Speaker 2>to do the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

236
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we need more of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

237
00:11:52.301 --> 00:11:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean because everybody seems hysterics</v>
<v Speaker 2>hysterical over,</v>

238
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 2>over emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like.</v>

239
00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.403
<v Speaker 2>It's like I can understand that if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was black and I wanted to go to a </v>

240
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:02.344
<v Speaker 2>historically black college and I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and I thought it was going to be </v>

241
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.000
<v Speaker 2>80 percent black and I got there and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

242
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:07.551
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

243
00:12:07.551 --> 00:12:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually still a minority here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The emotional part,</v>

244
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 2>I can understand it being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't feel right to me,</v>

245
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 2>but then when you hear that and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

246
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.910
<v Speaker 2>things actually are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Integration is this,</v>

247
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 2>this is all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

248
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.630
<v Speaker 2>this is the purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of freedom prayed for it.</v>

249
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I often say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be careful what you pray for.</v>

250
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.233
<v Speaker 2>This is exactly what we said we wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the opportunity to choose kind of </v>

251
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 2>what I can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when my great grandparents,</v>

252
00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

253
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Thurgood Marshall himself for folks </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't realize this.</v>

254
00:12:40.121 --> 00:12:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Thurgood Marshall didn't choose to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Howard University.</v>

255
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Law School,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thurgood Marshall.</v>

256
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Fact of the matter is applied to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Maryland,</v>

257
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.423
<v Speaker 2>was denied admission to that law school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went to Howard because it was the </v>

258
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 2>college for black students and law </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools for black students,</v>

259
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 2>and so you just have to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He then subsequently brought lawsuits to</v>

260
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:00.970
<v Speaker 2>actually stop that very thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

261
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 2>this was an anti Hbcu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The message was,</v>

262
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to choose irrespective</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my skin color where I go to school,</v>

263
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 2>so all of us should have predicted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we would be right where we are today.</v>

264
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.443
<v Speaker 2>What I find is the young folks just </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand the history and then </v>

265
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:17.500
<v Speaker 2>the older people refuse to tell.</v>

266
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 2>The honest is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what's going on there?</v>

267
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't believe there is so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>

268
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:24.170
<v Speaker 2>The media is so complicit in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

269
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

270
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.841
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:26.674
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and identity politics has become so </v>

272
00:13:27.821 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 2>rooted in everything that I don't blame </v>
<v Speaker 2>the young people who are misguided.</v>

273
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get through to them and,</v>

274
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.233
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the other people that you're </v>

275
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:36.664
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the older people on the academics that </v>

276
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:39.310
<v Speaker 2>are afraid to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened there?</v>

277
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Did you see it change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

278
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it,</v>

279
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

280
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.650
<v Speaker 2>and where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in school,</v>

281
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 2>you were encouraged to be a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a provocateur.</v>

282
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Always respectfully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never.</v>

283
00:13:49.151 --> 00:13:49.984
<v Speaker 2>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one wanted you to go out and hurt </v>

284
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 2>someone's feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we were encouraged in law school for</v>

285
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:54.694
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at things from all different </v>

286
00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:57.070
<v Speaker 2>sorts of perspectives.</v>

287
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 2>I was given a case once where you'd have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to represent the plaintiff and then turn</v>

288
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:02.250
<v Speaker 2>around and go against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

289
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.373
<v Speaker 2>defend him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've just lost that in education </v>

290
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:06.694
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I got to tell you more and </v>

291
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:09.550
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to students who say,</v>

292
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel a certain way,</v>

293
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:11.974
<v Speaker 2>but I know that if I either uttered </v>
<v Speaker 2>those my thoughts even in a question </v>

294
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:19.480
<v Speaker 2>format in the classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be attacked by from my professor.</v>

295
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 2>It would impact my participation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>class green that Po,</v>

296
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 2>that portion of my grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

297
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:25.834
<v Speaker 2>And more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you say to kids say when they </v>

298
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:29.230
<v Speaker 2>say that perhaps you're at the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>school?</v>

299
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to vote with your feet.</v>

300
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.493
<v Speaker 2>Colleges not about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be a time to explore </v>

301
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.853
<v Speaker 2>and to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you already knew what you needed to </v>

302
00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 2>know to sort of live in life and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>

303
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:42.483
<v Speaker 2>then you don't need to spend five or six</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and hundreds of thousands of </v>

304
00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:44.980
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>

305
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.813
<v Speaker 2>If you are the same person that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>walked in the door at the end of your </v>

306
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:50.050
<v Speaker 2>freshman year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

307
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 2>then you were cheated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tell them,</v>

308
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.550
<v Speaker 2>you should challenge the institution to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give you a better education.</v>

309
00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.530
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes that the way you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>better is to have to confront ideas that</v>

310
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 2>you don't necessarily embrace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand them.</v>

311
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 2>One situation that that sort of comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

312
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:09.880
<v Speaker 2>and I think it helps my students a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Understand where I come from us.</v>

313
00:15:09.881 --> 00:15:10.161
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

314
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:10.994
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was an employment lawyer early in my </v>

315
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Speaker 2>career and at that time there was a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

316
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:18.800
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around whether or not gay,</v>

317
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.130
<v Speaker 2>lesbian sexual orientation was covered </v>
<v Speaker 2>under title seven.</v>

318
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Question.</v>

319
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Gender and sex was clear if you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>being discriminated against on the basis</v>

320
00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:28.604
<v Speaker 2>of something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That on sort of sexual orientation that </v>

321
00:15:30.051 --> 00:15:30.884
<v Speaker 2>wasn't covered.</v>

322
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I actually brought those cases and made </v>
<v Speaker 2>those arguments.</v>

323
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:35.220
<v Speaker 2>I defended them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>

324
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 2>she was not the intent of the congress </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was ridiculous,</v>

325
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.540
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gender is something that's innate.</v>

326
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 2>You're born That way and low gay and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian,</v>

327
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:46.250
<v Speaker 2>maybe not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward.</v>

328
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Where are we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 1992.</v>

329
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important that context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

330
00:15:51.891 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Put it in context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

331
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.210
<v Speaker 2>fast forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you began to evolve and grow.</v>

332
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.073
<v Speaker 2>You start sitting down and getting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know people who are different than you </v>

333
00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:02.680
<v Speaker 2>are or that your family is or that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

334
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:03.563
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you began to evolve and it challenges </v>

335
00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:06.284
<v Speaker 2>your own notions of what is right and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is wrong and maybe you conclude </v>

336
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:14.030
<v Speaker 2>there is no right or wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just life that we're evolving as</v>

337
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:16.490
<v Speaker 2>a human species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of even.</v>

338
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:20.840
<v Speaker 2>I've had to do that and there are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many instances of that in my own life,</v>

339
00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:21.674
<v Speaker 2>and so when you begin to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations in the context of the </v>

340
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:27.170
<v Speaker 2>classroom with students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the growth.</v>

341
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the beautY.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shouldn't be the beauty of it.</v>

342
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm seeing more and more,</v>

343
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 2>david is there actually retarding the </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth students.</v>

344
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.690
<v Speaker 2>You're not encouraged to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come in thinking a certain way.</v>

345
00:16:38.691 --> 00:16:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Your professors want you to think a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>

346
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Your institution wants you to think a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way,</v>

347
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.933
<v Speaker 2>but here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is then you go to work </v>

348
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.013
<v Speaker 2>and you have to confront the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're not protected in this </v>

349
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:52.394
<v Speaker 2>bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to live and work next to </v>

350
00:16:53.841 --> 00:16:56.760
<v Speaker 2>people who don't look like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and frankly that's a challenge.</v>

351
00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 2>That's something that people talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

352
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.410
<v Speaker 2>when I talk about black colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only.</v>

353
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:04.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't question the relevancy of hbcs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a dumb argument.</v>

354
00:17:04.401 --> 00:17:09.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a dumb question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a fair question that is posed.</v>

355
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.930
<v Speaker 2>If you have gone to a black elementary </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

356
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.823
<v Speaker 2>middle school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up in a black community and then </v>

357
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:15.740
<v Speaker 2>you went to a black college.</v>

358
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.120
<v Speaker 2>The first meaningful interaction that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had with people who are not black is</v>

359
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.003
<v Speaker 2>in the workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be at a disadvantage </v>

360
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 2>just practically speaking and so you it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has some downside,</v>

361
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 2>tons of upside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

362
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 2>being a majority and a minority </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

363
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 2>black colleges give you a very special </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nurturing environment to grow in,</v>

364
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.120
<v Speaker 2>but there's a cost to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

365
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Is that just the natural evolution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way humans are,</v>

366
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:48.860
<v Speaker 2>that if you have a legit grievance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may need a different place.</v>

367
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Or for thurgood marshall who did not get</v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted to the Maryland law school,</v>

368
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.070
<v Speaker 2>so he needed a place to go to completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>legit in that time and place,</v>

369
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 2>but that eventually we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a quality works,</v>

370
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 2>because the arc does bend towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice,</v>

371
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 2>that eventually you slowly need these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things less.</v>

372
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:06.060
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that there's no use For </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

373
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:06.690
<v Speaker 2>but you.</v>

374
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.523
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of people are sort of addicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that original pain or instance or </v>

375
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You nailed it.</v>

376
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us.</v>

377
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

378
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 2>it's addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

379
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:18.804
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Weaning yourself off of that is </v>

380
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 2>difficult and that's not limited to </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people or any group of people.</v>

381
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:28.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just that you get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this notion that we were to create.</v>

382
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Remember even the concept of affirmative</v>
<v Speaker 2>action was supposed to be remedial.</v>

383
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 2>It was not supposed to go on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

384
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.473
<v Speaker 2>BuT what happens is if you get used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it's a benefit that a new words </v>

385
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.390
<v Speaker 2>to you and people who look like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

386
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.680
<v Speaker 2>it's really tough to one day say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

387
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 2>that's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a seven year old daughter and I,</v>

388
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:46.794
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a point at which she's going to </v>

389
00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 2>come off of daddy's credit card and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to fight me if it's 18,</v>

390
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:52.764
<v Speaker 2>if it's 28 of his 38,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day that I decide you now have to </v>

391
00:18:55.561 --> 00:18:57.630
<v Speaker 2>leave the nest and figure this out </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

392
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.160
<v Speaker 2>If it's 38,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I move in with your dog.</v>

393
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're right,</v>

394
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.270
<v Speaker 2>you're onto something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

395
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:06.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even think about just in real life.</v>

396
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:10.560
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that I'm intrigued by </v>
<v Speaker 2>is I could not wait until I turned 18.</v>

397
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:12.483
<v Speaker 2>I could leave my nest and my mama and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>daddy's house and go and start creating </v>

398
00:19:16.351 --> 00:19:19.650
<v Speaker 2>my own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm seeing some of them for economic</v>

399
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:20.484
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just everyone's sort of staying at </v>

400
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:26.460
<v Speaker 2>home and they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very different world that we live</v>

401
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 2>in right now and I'm intrigued by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

402
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.220
<v Speaker 2>How much of this also is about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>family in general?</v>

403
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things when I've had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple,</v>

404
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.900
<v Speaker 2>particularly in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I've had black conservatives on,</v>

405
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like larry elder,</v>

406
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:40.730
<v Speaker 2>talking about the black family you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,</v>

407
00:19:40.731 --> 00:19:42.910
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned your mom and your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

408
00:19:42.911 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I suspect they're still married.</v>

409
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

410
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.690
<v Speaker 2>so that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were for obviously most of your</v>

411
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:50.003
<v Speaker 2>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

412
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.800
<v Speaker 2>How much of that structure is related to</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this?</v>

413
00:19:52.801 --> 00:19:53.634
<v Speaker 2>Why then you can't necessarily deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside influences or or any of that </v>

414
00:19:58.291 --> 00:20:00.000
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I struggle with that.</v>

415
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 2>I struggle with that because because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the realities of slavery,</v>

416
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>the black community was always largely </v>
<v Speaker 2>maternally run.</v>

417
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Dad and mom were separated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Family,</v>

418
00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:11.604
<v Speaker 2>the family unit in the traditional sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't exist so and we were successful </v>

419
00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:17.260
<v Speaker 2>in spite of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

420
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm noT so sure that I now what I all </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

421
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:21.204
<v Speaker 2>I think the value of having mom and dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the home and and frankly at some </v>

422
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:25.104
<v Speaker 2>point grandparents and home to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in that I think it's incredibly </v>

423
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:28.494
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not prepared to say that's why </v>

424
00:20:30.961 --> 00:20:32.520
<v Speaker 2>everything is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I pointed out,</v>

425
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:33.354
<v Speaker 2>my parents ultimately got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were divorced and all to have two </v>

426
00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:37.500
<v Speaker 2>sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We both went to college.</v>

427
00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:40.100
<v Speaker 2>All three of us rather were successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have great lives.</v>

428
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's been to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one has eight kids that you know,</v>

429
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.100
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know that I'm Prepared to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

430
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 2>It's totally about</v>

431
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.170
<v Speaker 1>sort of the family unit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think family,</v>

432
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.033
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that I'm happy to see now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his family is being more broadly </v>

433
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:54.514
<v Speaker 1>defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We and our community oftentimes talk </v>

434
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:57.814
<v Speaker 1>about it takes a village and the family </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be the little old lady cross the </v>

435
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know your grandmother,</v>

436
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:08.071
<v Speaker 1>she might essentially become your </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandma in local parentes the concept in</v>

437
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:09.394
<v Speaker 1>latin that there a whole bunch of folks </v>
<v Speaker 1>who act as parents to make it all </v>

438
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:13.834
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think we have to be a little too </v>

439
00:21:14.591 --> 00:21:16.330
<v Speaker 1>careful and I hear the strict </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>

440
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:17.164
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all of this is because the family </v>

441
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 1>model has degraded as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historically,</v>

442
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so sure we as a people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular ever had that.</v>

443
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.290
<v Speaker 1>That's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

444
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:27.124
<v Speaker 1>I was mentioning to you before it also </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I just went to george washington's </v>

445
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.483
<v Speaker 1>estate and you can go to the slave </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters and they do a daily memorial </v>

446
00:21:32.931 --> 00:21:34.810
<v Speaker 1>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they talk about the men living here.</v>

447
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.780
<v Speaker 1>They're living here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sometimes only got it interacts for</v>

448
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 1>for minutes in a day and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

449
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

450
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:46.111
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when we have to help people </v>
<v Speaker 1>revisit history sometimes they're like,</v>

451
00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:47.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>

452
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly.</v>

453
00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.550
<v Speaker 1>SpeakiNg of history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't planning on going here,</v>

454
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Speaker 1>but as long as we're talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>list,</v>

455
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.540
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of all the monuments </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff happening right now?</v>

456
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:56.374
<v Speaker 1>Because I just read one this week that </v>
<v Speaker 1>at at christ church and I think it's in </v>

457
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:00.244
<v Speaker 1>alexandria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're taking down george the minute I </v>

458
00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:03.754
<v Speaker 1>think it's just a plaque actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess there was also a plaque to </v>

459
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:07.750
<v Speaker 1>robert e dot lee that upset some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they said,</v>

460
00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:08.584
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take down george </v>

461
00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:10.720
<v Speaker 1>washington's as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Washington,</v>

462
00:22:10.721 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 1>than there is no doubt he did own </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves.</v>

463
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:14.350
<v Speaker 1>He freed as many as he legally could.</v>

464
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.183
<v Speaker 1>When he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all of them more because some of </v>

465
00:22:16.841 --> 00:22:17.674
<v Speaker 1>them were technically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think owned by martha or for her or </v>

466
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.840
<v Speaker 1>her family or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as I said,</v>

467
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:24.490
<v Speaker 1>they do a great memorial to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

468
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:25.324
<v Speaker 1>we're all complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who were writing law is to free </v>

469
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 1>people while they own people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a whole freaking thing,</v>

470
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.733
<v Speaker 1>but me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want my answer firstly because I'm </v>

471
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 1>glad to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tell me what do you think?</v>

472
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can take these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

473
00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I think you can put a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

474
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.220
<v Speaker 1>a counter monument next to them or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plaque that explains more.</v>

475
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.173
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could convince me that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can all be moved to a museum where then </v>

476
00:22:49.361 --> 00:22:50.830
<v Speaker 1>you are going to learn about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

477
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:51.873
<v Speaker 1>but I'm very leery that there's just no </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending here that we're going to take </v>

478
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:56.260
<v Speaker 1>down the robert e dot lee stuff.</v>

479
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.810
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

480
00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:01.210
<v Speaker 1>other confederate stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he will creep to George Washington.</v>

481
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.600
<v Speaker 1>It will creep to Thomas Jefferson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just at the memorial,</v>

482
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 1>but words that that man wrote about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom is.</v>

483
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the stuff we should all care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and I just feared that there is no</v>

484
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:11.254
<v Speaker 1>ending here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's enough of a </v>

485
00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:13.594
<v Speaker 1>justification not to take anything down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's really where my position is </v>

486
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:18.280
<v Speaker 1>coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it won't end.</v>

487
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not surprisingly,</v>

488
00:23:20.261 --> 00:23:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I violently agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

489
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.080
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

490
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I would have accepted either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

491
00:23:24.561 --> 00:23:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I know that would've given him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but frankly,</v>

492
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a couple of aha moments for </v>

493
00:23:29.801 --> 00:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

494
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.930
<v Speaker 1>we don't like to acknowledge this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but black people owned slaves in America</v>

495
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:37.060
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

496
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.253
<v Speaker 1>I'm the litmus test is if you own slave </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow we should erase from history or </v>

497
00:23:43.781 --> 00:23:46.150
<v Speaker 1>puts you into a museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little box so that only</v>

498
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.920
<v Speaker 2>people who visit museums will learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

499
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.460
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't really like that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it up there because I,</v>

500
00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:55.040
<v Speaker 2>in a q and a that I did at claremont </v>
<v Speaker 2>mckenna,</v>

501
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 2>a kid asked me and I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

502
00:23:57.381 --> 00:23:58.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if we put them in mind as I said?</v>

503
00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can play with that one a little bit,</v>

504
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.020
<v Speaker 2>but to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take this to its,</v>

505
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:03.973
<v Speaker 2>I think illogical in [inaudible] we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't go through and parse every </v>

506
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 2>person's history and we find the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing they did that we didn't like,</v>

507
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.380
<v Speaker 2>which by the way at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point in the world may have been</v>

508
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.470
<v Speaker 2>totally the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not arguing it was good or bad.</v>

509
00:24:18.471 --> 00:24:19.304
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it was the way people </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived and it was the what was the more </v>

510
00:24:22.571 --> 00:24:23.360
<v Speaker 2>ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

511
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.480
<v Speaker 2>whatever of the time I.</v>

512
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 2>I struggle with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you put everything into context.</v>

513
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.600
<v Speaker 2>When I ride through and I see a </v>
<v Speaker 2>confederate statue,</v>

514
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:33.434
<v Speaker 2>I was laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in old town alexandria the other </v>

515
00:24:34.851 --> 00:24:38.230
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have passed this particular this.</v>

516
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:39.263
<v Speaker 2>Which one is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just as robert e dot lee is the </v>

517
00:24:40.551 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 2>one that's sitting right in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just passed.</v>

518
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the street of past king </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

519
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:45.284
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a statute at this guy on a </v>

520
00:24:47.771 --> 00:24:48.604
<v Speaker 2>horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've passed out a number of times and </v>

521
00:24:49.341 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

522
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.990
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

523
00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:51.824
<v Speaker 2>I've also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in Washington dc on capitol hill </v>

524
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:56.570
<v Speaker 2>and there are all sorts of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>statutes that frankly charles barkley,</v>

525
00:24:56.571 --> 00:25:01.571
<v Speaker 2>who I don't quote very often to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>impression would it dell,</v>

526
00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 2>but he said something which was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>provocative.</v>

527
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.910
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>

528
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:12.050
<v Speaker 2>most african american people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about that damn monument.</v>

529
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:12.771
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

530
00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:15.770
<v Speaker 2>we have real issues facing our </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

531
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.903
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that we have now gotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>preoccupied with these monuments is </v>

532
00:25:20.631 --> 00:25:24.920
<v Speaker 2>bizarre to me and frankly and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing to me is that is divisive.</v>

533
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you start peeling apart people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

534
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.900
<v Speaker 2>all of this is sort of the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country,</v>

535
00:25:32.901 --> 00:25:36.160
<v Speaker 2>the good and the bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the beauty of telling</v>

536
00:25:36.161 --> 00:25:38.000
<v Speaker 2>a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I talk to students about it,</v>

537
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:40.650
<v Speaker 2>because I've had this conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of our students and I said,</v>

538
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us,</v>

539
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.043
<v Speaker 2>we go back into history even to find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your grandparents weren't perfect </v>

540
00:25:46.101 --> 00:25:47.790
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

541
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:48.643
<v Speaker 2>the grandfather who beat on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmother who cheated on your </v>

542
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:53.000
<v Speaker 2>grandmother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The grandmother who,</v>

543
00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say back in the day,</v>

544
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:57.870
<v Speaker 2>decided not to have a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>just had a kid out of wedlock and decide</v>

545
00:25:57.871 --> 00:26:00.440
<v Speaker 2>to give them to an ant and never </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledged and was.</v>

546
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.783
<v Speaker 2>There's so many things we've ball our </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies and the notion that somehow </v>

547
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.673
<v Speaker 2>you've literally made this person's life</v>
<v Speaker 2>less important because of a decision </v>

548
00:26:13.881 --> 00:26:14.660
<v Speaker 2>that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

549
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.493
<v Speaker 2>all of us are growing on this journey </v>
<v Speaker 2>called life and I just think we've </v>

550
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:22.280
<v Speaker 2>gotten too serious about it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>also frankly divided the country.</v>

551
00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:24.410
<v Speaker 2>A country that is way too divided right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

552
00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen.</v>

553
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I think of martin luther king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lincoln thurgood marshall.</v>

554
00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 2>They have to be like sitting back </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere looking at this hand,</v>

555
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe.</v>

556
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Once we pulled the rules down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the laws,</v>

557
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.163
<v Speaker 2>became a more open and free society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us could have thought that this </v>

558
00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:45.240
<v Speaker 2>is where we'd end up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

559
00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the easy answer is to blame it on trump,</v>

560
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.130
<v Speaker 2>but the fact of the matter is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>started way before.</v>

561
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.310
<v Speaker 2>This has nothing I know so now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

562
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:54.740
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the.</v>

563
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Even the nfl protests were going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>under obama horse.</v>

564
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.430
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about the historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

565
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.020
<v Speaker 2>obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his first president,</v>

566
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 2>first four years was against gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage.</v>

567
00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 2>now 20 years ago we got to take obama's </v>
<v Speaker 2>statue or take his library down or don't</v>

568
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:14.640
<v Speaker 2>even start me on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got countless examples.</v>

569
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to folks at a.</v>

570
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.340
<v Speaker 2>That was a big discussion about public </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools and you know,</v>

571
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.440
<v Speaker 2>we need to send all of our kids to </v>
<v Speaker 2>public schools,</v>

572
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.970
<v Speaker 2>synthesize timeout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>timeout,</v>

573
00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:24.804
<v Speaker 2>timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The obama girls were to to go to school </v>

574
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.440
<v Speaker 2>sidwell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not very fast for them,</v>

575
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.130
<v Speaker 2>but then you can't turn around and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

576
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:32.964
<v Speaker 2>public school's a wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're great for everyone when they </v>

577
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.640
<v Speaker 2>know the reality is they are good enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your children.</v>

578
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Those are some of the moments when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to stop and just pause and say,</v>

579
00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.960
<v Speaker 2>you know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotten crazy.</v>

580
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.681
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

581
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:47.514
<v Speaker 2>I'm so frustrated with it right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're picking apart people's </v>

582
00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:51.114
<v Speaker 2>lives and the reality is none of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>would want someone to do the same thing </v>

583
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.240
<v Speaker 2>on an individual level with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to pick my life apart.</v>

584
00:27:57.241 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 2>You can come out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a horrible person.</v>

585
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.413
<v Speaker 2>Ignore the fact that I have a beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven year old daughter that my parents </v>

586
00:28:02.521 --> 00:28:04.080
<v Speaker 2>were wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm a good son a good,</v>

587
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.680
<v Speaker 2>but you want to focus on the one or two </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions that perhaps I would have.</v>

588
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:08.663
<v Speaker 2>I'm frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have done them differently if I </v>

589
00:28:10.231 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 2>were 48.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 18.</v>

590
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:14.641
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

591
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:15.474
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

592
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 2>we're just in an interesting spot and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that's what you're talking about,</v>

593
00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:19.260
<v Speaker 2>but it disturbs me.</v>

594
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.093
<v Speaker 2>It disturbs me in some very significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that I'm raising a child in this </v>

595
00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:26.400
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country in particular.</v>

596
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.800
<v Speaker 2>This is not the country I envisioned it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

597
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:29.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's any chance that it </v>

598
00:28:31.531 --> 00:28:32.364
<v Speaker 2>actually is the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just the level of noise has </v>

599
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:38.100
<v Speaker 2>gotten so out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we think about,</v>

600
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:38.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk a lot about social media and how </v>

601
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.003
<v Speaker 2>twitter is affecting everybody and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way we will cater news to ourselves and </v>

602
00:28:43.711 --> 00:28:47.100
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>BuT then I took all of august offline.</v>

603
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.020
<v Speaker 2>I shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was working on my book.</v>

604
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I disappeared for awhile and when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent more time just,</v>

605
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean I talked to people for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but outside of this room,</v>

606
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:56.004
<v Speaker 2>just talking to random people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people do buy everything </v>

607
00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:00.774
<v Speaker 2>that you just said there and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that people are necessarily as </v>

608
00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:07.920
<v Speaker 2>hysterical as maybe we feel they are.</v>

609
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.753
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's possible or is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to give a real silver </v>

610
00:29:10.651 --> 00:29:11.484
<v Speaker 2>lining to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're trying to feel better </v>

611
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.613
<v Speaker 2>because as much as we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't just put the media over in a </v>

612
00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:17.610
<v Speaker 2>little box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Particularly.</v>

613
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.180
<v Speaker 2>It used to be traditional media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now social media and so when you add</v>

614
00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:22.014
<v Speaker 2>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really does influence the narrative </v>

615
00:29:23.821 --> 00:29:24.654
<v Speaker 2>and it influences what people think it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means to live in America and and I do </v>

616
00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:32.220
<v Speaker 2>think we're in a very different place </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and you're right,</v>

617
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.910
<v Speaker 2>every person in the world doesn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

618
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.753
<v Speaker 2>Manafort gets charged today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of americans don't </v>

619
00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:38.754
<v Speaker 2>know or care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people who watch the news and who </v>

620
00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:42.050
<v Speaker 2>read and who think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

621
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.840
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it matters.</v>

622
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:46.510
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of americans are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to keep the lights on,</v>

623
00:29:46.511 --> 00:29:47.344
<v Speaker 2>I want to put my kid in school and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want a decent life and retire with some </v>

624
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 2>decent savings in a bank that's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>practical.</v>

625
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.180
<v Speaker 2>So I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the influencers,</v>

626
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:57.580
<v Speaker 2>people like me and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

627
00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.653
<v Speaker 2>maybe not like the two of us is the more</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal media has just put it out there </v>

628
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:04.744
<v Speaker 2>so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Progressively they're really crafting </v>

629
00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 2>the narrative and the message and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

630
00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.913
<v Speaker 2>it's something that we have to pause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find yourself with a political </v>

631
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:16.000
<v Speaker 2>home?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously I'm in a lockstep with</v>

632
00:30:16.001 --> 00:30:16.834
<v Speaker 2>so much of the things that you're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of the things that you're talking </v>

633
00:30:18.581 --> 00:30:19.780
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I heard you give that speech,</v>

634
00:30:19.781 --> 00:30:20.614
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

635
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

636
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 20 times I was like,</v>

637
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:23.321
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

638
00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.041
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

639
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:24.874
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

640
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

641
00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you consider yourself,</v>

642
00:30:27.941 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 2>are you in a party or totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent?</v>

643
00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.820
<v Speaker 2>So or as when I was in North Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was called unaffiliated.</v>

644
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:35.543
<v Speaker 2>That was the phrase you wanted an </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent because there were </v>

645
00:30:37.031 --> 00:30:37.590
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>

646
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.830
<v Speaker 2>So that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a third party.</v>

647
00:30:38.831 --> 00:30:39.664
<v Speaker 2>So it's unaffiliate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a democrat for years and actually </v>

648
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 2>quite as it's kept up was a big part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hillary clinton's 2008 campaign,</v>

649
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.360
<v Speaker 2>a raised tons of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had her in my home.</v>

650
00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Fundraisers had erskine bowles and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife.</v>

651
00:30:52.301 --> 00:30:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really into that world.</v>

652
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I did not see that in the research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

653
00:30:56.781 --> 00:30:57.614
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm literally hosted in my home in </v>

654
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina and did a lot and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast forward,</v>

655
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:06.340
<v Speaker 2>I've become this last election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly less enamored.</v>

656
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.233
<v Speaker 2>So I was not involved in that campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also wasn't a involved in donald </v>

657
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:12.364
<v Speaker 2>trump's campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have decided that I'm going to </v>

658
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:17.620
<v Speaker 2>have to figure out where I fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now it's just,</v>

659
00:31:17.621 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to say I'm an american,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a patriot.</v>

660
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:20.853
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure out on balance </v>
<v Speaker 2>which individual is looking out for the </v>

661
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:27.670
<v Speaker 2>best interest of America.</v>

662
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.340
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lonely place sometimes.</v>

663
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.020
<v Speaker 2>It's because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in this bike,</v>

664
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.233
<v Speaker 2>but you know you are a democrat or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican and some call themselves </v>

665
00:31:37.151 --> 00:31:37.984
<v Speaker 2>independents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is they lean left or </v>

666
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:41.290
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of in the middle.</v>

667
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.980
<v Speaker 2>They were things that I think I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>take positions that I take that are more</v>

668
00:31:44.981 --> 00:31:45.814
<v Speaker 2>conservatively aligned and the near </v>
<v Speaker 2>times when it's more or less </v>

669
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.760
<v Speaker 2>conservatively or more liberally </v>
<v Speaker 2>aligned,</v>

670
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.180
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think you can just fall into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a box.</v>

671
00:31:55.181 --> 00:31:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the problem.</v>

672
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some issues that I really take</v>

673
00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:01.450
<v Speaker 2>a strong position on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were just,</v>

674
00:32:01.451 --> 00:32:02.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just the other day,</v>

675
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.070
<v Speaker 2>and we'll talk about something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at the advancing justice seminar.</v>

676
00:32:06.071 --> 00:32:06.904
<v Speaker 2>It's advanced justice summit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hosted by the Charles Koch </v>

677
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:10.534
<v Speaker 2>foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big discussion around reducing the </v>

678
00:32:13.361 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 2>number of incarcerated americans and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone throughout by 20 slash 20,</v>

679
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.340
<v Speaker 2>we want to reduce the number of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>incarcerated by 50 percent.</v>

680
00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.190
<v Speaker 2>And I paused and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

681
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.473
<v Speaker 2>that's dumb a suppose 30 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people really should be </v>

682
00:32:29.291 --> 00:32:31.660
<v Speaker 2>incarcerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suppose they're not.</v>

683
00:32:31.661 --> 00:32:32.494
<v Speaker 2>They should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They absolutely cannot be put back on </v>

684
00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:35.344
<v Speaker 2>the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're telling me you're thinking </v>

685
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:40.560
<v Speaker 2>through just someone yells out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and I'm thinking it through and</v>

686
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.133
<v Speaker 2>tell you why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it bothered me because here's </v>

687
00:32:43.431 --> 00:32:44.264
<v Speaker 2>the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in one of those fragile </v>

688
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:46.004
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up and I shared this with the </v>

689
00:32:47.511 --> 00:32:48.081
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

690
00:32:48.081 --> 00:32:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in the area and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmother,</v>

691
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget riding up high school.</v>

692
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.790
<v Speaker 2>People would run up to our windows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

693
00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:56.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 plus year old grandmother and me and </v>

694
00:32:58.521 --> 00:33:03.521
<v Speaker 2>an rotc uniform going to highschool drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealers run up to our windows.</v>

695
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Prostitutes are standing on the corner </v>
<v Speaker 2>in morning.</v>

696
00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:07.730
<v Speaker 2>This is 7:30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>8:00</v>

697
00:33:07.731 --> 00:33:09.370
<v Speaker 2>in the morning next to a school.</v>

698
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this was the community.</v>

699
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.910
<v Speaker 2>My grandmother one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget it,</v>

700
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 2>she said they wouldn't allow this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>white town.</v>

701
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.300
<v Speaker 2>They would never put up with this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>white down.</v>

702
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.580
<v Speaker 2>She was so bothered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she became committed.</v>

703
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.593
<v Speaker 2>She called demanded police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She demanded that you remove these </v>

704
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:26.804
<v Speaker 2>people from our community and so fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward you just want to release them </v>

705
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:31.814
<v Speaker 2>all back to our community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said this to one of the attendees </v>

706
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:36.110
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem.</v>

707
00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:36.944
<v Speaker 2>That sounds great and it's great for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're not coming back to your </v>

708
00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:40.304
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that's why this isn't your </v>

709
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:42.764
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you release 50 percent of these </v>

710
00:33:43.851 --> 00:33:44.840
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you think they're coming?</v>

711
00:33:44.841 --> 00:33:45.674
<v Speaker 2>They're not coming into suburbia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to show back up in the </v>

712
00:33:47.271 --> 00:33:51.050
<v Speaker 2>communities and continue terrorizing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>negatively impacting the community.</v>

713
00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:53.540
<v Speaker 2>So on that plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell that story to say,</v>

714
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:54.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

715
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I am passionate about and I am bob.</v>

716
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.043
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate well intended people </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that just releasing half the </v>

717
00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:03.290
<v Speaker 2>people who are currently incarcerated </v>
<v Speaker 2>into our communities as a good thing,</v>

718
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 2>but they don't think about the impact of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

719
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 2>When my kid can't go out and play in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>streets for being shot,</v>

720
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:11.803
<v Speaker 2>my kid can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My daughter has to walk past these </v>

721
00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:14.504
<v Speaker 2>scantily clad women who were selling </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and she begins to think </v>

722
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.430
<v Speaker 2>that's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the world,</v>

723
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:22.070
<v Speaker 2>and you may call that a nonviolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened her,</v>

724
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:23.143
<v Speaker 2>but it's not nonviolent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually more violent because it's </v>

725
00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:27.680
<v Speaker 2>working into the psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These young people,</v>

726
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much there because you could </v>

727
00:34:29.631 --> 00:34:30.890
<v Speaker 2>also look at that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

728
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.753
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of those people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in there for drug offenses not </v>

729
00:34:33.531 --> 00:34:34.700
<v Speaker 2>selling right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

730
00:34:34.701 --> 00:34:36.890
<v Speaker 2>and if they had had better </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation where more money,</v>

731
00:34:36.891 --> 00:34:41.630
<v Speaker 2>they would have never been in jail in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place and either parents or so</v>

732
00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:43.100
<v Speaker 2>you can't just blame the government.</v>

733
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.933
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to get to 20 and blame the </v>

734
00:34:46.611 --> 00:34:47.444
<v Speaker 2>system for not giving them good lawyers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the system for incarcerating them </v>

735
00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:51.134
<v Speaker 2>too long and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you forget that a lot of that stuff </v>

736
00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:54.374
<v Speaker 2>started a lot earlier in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you now you took her back to the </v>

737
00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.140
<v Speaker 2>conservative point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

738
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:01.123
<v Speaker 2>It's not that scared because by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my only point is it doesn't have to be </v>

739
00:35:03.081 --> 00:35:04.880
<v Speaker 2>mom or dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be someone.</v>

740
00:35:04.881 --> 00:35:09.230
<v Speaker 2>It could be a school teacher that helped</v>
<v Speaker 2>infuse morals and the sense of right and</v>

741
00:35:09.231 --> 00:35:11.630
<v Speaker 2>wrong into that kit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got to go back.</v>

742
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:13.040
<v Speaker 2>We can't just wake up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

743
00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:15.740
<v Speaker 2>now you've got a 19 year old who has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long criminal history.</v>

744
00:35:15.741 --> 00:35:16.574
<v Speaker 2>No regard for anyone or anything and say</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just think he or she should not be </v>

745
00:35:21.111 --> 00:35:21.944
<v Speaker 2>incarcerated.</v>

746
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then pray,</v>

747
00:35:24.201 --> 00:35:26.630
<v Speaker 2>tell what are you going to do about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

748
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever get an answer to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you let these people out,</v>

749
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally with you.</v>

750
00:35:31.011 --> 00:35:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Came from a bad place.</v>

751
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have the proper support </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially in jail for doing drugs,</v>

752
00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:38.760
<v Speaker 2>not even selling them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is,</v>

753
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to get this person out of jail.</v>

754
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Even if even if it's just an economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

755
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:44.510
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to have the system </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending money on it.</v>

756
00:35:44.511 --> 00:35:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you put them out there,</v>

757
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:46.524
<v Speaker 2>you still have some responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the system or whatever you </v>

758
00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:50.754
<v Speaker 2>wanna call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has some responsibility to make sure </v>

759
00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:52.554
<v Speaker 2>that now you just don't toss this back </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the mix of what got them there in </v>

760
00:35:56.131 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 2>the first place and how do you fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the big question.</v>

761
00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:04.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean the easy answer is released it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what I would say.</v>

762
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.753
<v Speaker 2>And then what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing that bothers me is that </v>

763
00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:11.850
<v Speaker 2>many of the people who advocate for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>release release,</v>

764
00:36:11.851 --> 00:36:15.240
<v Speaker 2>release don't have to answer the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question what?</v>

765
00:36:15.241 --> 00:36:16.074
<v Speaker 2>Because they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live in neighborhoods with gate </v>

766
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:20.130
<v Speaker 2>gated neighborhoods with a lot of police</v>
<v Speaker 2>protection,</v>

767
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:22.830
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're not impacted by,</v>

768
00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:23.683
<v Speaker 2>they just want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get them out and we see this </v>

769
00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 2>listen and unfortunately with </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals who suffer with mental,</v>

770
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.130
<v Speaker 2>a mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

771
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.460
<v Speaker 2>you want them out and then what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

772
00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:38.280
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's someone else's problem.</v>

773
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.143
<v Speaker 2>And the system as you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the non system hasn't answered that </v>

774
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:43.074
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

775
00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:48.733
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's shift a little bit to some </v>

776
00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:50.724
<v Speaker 2>specific issues because I think we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done a nice little broad job to start </v>

777
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:54.654
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

778
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.613
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned to me briefly something </v>
<v Speaker 2>about daca that I thought was really </v>

779
00:36:57.391 --> 00:36:58.710
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the black community,</v>

780
00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.040
<v Speaker 2>you sort of split on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

781
00:37:01.041 --> 00:37:01.861
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

782
00:37:01.861 --> 00:37:04.530
<v Speaker 2>daca is on iTs surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an easy,</v>

783
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.840
<v Speaker 2>it should have been easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I've come talking about,</v>

784
00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:07.674
<v Speaker 2>the complexity of it and the nuances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So increasingly our students on hbcu </v>

785
00:37:12.751 --> 00:37:13.381
<v Speaker 2>campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

786
00:37:13.381 --> 00:37:16.380
<v Speaker 2>raising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have real beef with this as the way</v>

787
00:37:16.381 --> 00:37:19.290
<v Speaker 2>they described it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the students put it in it,</v>

788
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.960
<v Speaker 2>it made me pause because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an easy one.</v>

789
00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:23.460
<v Speaker 2>You're noT going to send 12 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people home.</v>

790
00:37:23.461 --> 00:37:25.410
<v Speaker 2>These kids were brought here by their </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

791
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:26.263
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I tell my daughter we're going </v>

792
00:37:27.241 --> 00:37:28.074
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's gone.</v>

793
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get it.</v>

794
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then one of the young women put it </v>

795
00:37:32.311 --> 00:37:33.144
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

796
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the chicago.</v>

797
00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:39.070
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the irony of this is that they're very,</v>

798
00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.090
<v Speaker 2>the America is all rallying around </v>
<v Speaker 2>providing not only a,</v>

799
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.480
<v Speaker 2>the ability for these students to enroll</v>
<v Speaker 2>in school,</v>

800
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 2>but oftentimes full scholarships for </v>
<v Speaker 2>these students.</v>

801
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.310
<v Speaker 2>The daca students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while she said,</v>

802
00:37:50.311 --> 00:37:53.670
<v Speaker 2>and here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the legal descendant of slaves,</v>

803
00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:54.504
<v Speaker 2>we were forced to come here and I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out how to pay for my </v>

804
00:37:56.701 --> 00:37:59.730
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's this tension,</v>

805
00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.520
<v Speaker 2>there's real tension and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whisper it.</v>

806
00:38:02.521 --> 00:38:03.301
<v Speaker 2>So I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

807
00:38:03.301 --> 00:38:04.134
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just talk about that in </v>

808
00:38:06.181 --> 00:38:07.200
<v Speaker 2>class?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

809
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.640
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will be killed.</v>

810
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.400
<v Speaker 2>that you can't talk about that in class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

811
00:38:11.401 --> 00:38:12.234
<v Speaker 2>but there's an underground sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about that doesn't seem </v>

812
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.613
<v Speaker 2>fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If America has enough money to provide </v>

813
00:38:19.231 --> 00:38:22.140
<v Speaker 2>additional scholarship assistance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>

814
00:38:22.141 --> 00:38:22.974
<v Speaker 2>then shouldn't you take care of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like us who were brought here are </v>

815
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.220
<v Speaker 2>parents who were brought here and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly are.</v>

816
00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

817
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.000
<v Speaker 2>that's really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a really.</v>

818
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made me pause.</v>

819
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.933
<v Speaker 1>there is also a recent article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the chicago times where a </v>

820
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:40.624
<v Speaker 1>guy wrote an editorial about rahm </v>
<v Speaker 1>emanuel wants to spend one or </v>

821
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:44.224
<v Speaker 1>$2,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm providing ids for undocumented </v>

822
00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 1>immigrants and the black alderman had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>melt down.</v>

823
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.713
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally it's quoted all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the papers saying thIs is absurd and </v>

824
00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:58.110
<v Speaker 1>enough's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have americans here,</v>

825
00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:03.010
<v Speaker 1>americans in chicago who need x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y and z and instead you want to go spend</v>

826
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:04.450
<v Speaker 1>a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a tension.</v>

827
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Americans that are really inflection </v>
<v Speaker 1>point that's just not black and white or</v>

828
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:08.374
<v Speaker 1>conservative and liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tension now amongst people of </v>

829
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:12.160
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

830
00:39:12.161 --> 00:39:12.994
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that obviously that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation is good and it's nice to </v>

831
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:16.954
<v Speaker 1>hear that a student said something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that made you reevaluate because </v>

832
00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:21.580
<v Speaker 1>that shows you practice what you preach </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

833
00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>

834
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.240
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the leaDer right now?</v>

835
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:26.840
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

836
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you probably get this one all the</v>

837
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:30.910
<v Speaker 1>time and I don't even like the question </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a certain way,</v>

838
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.260
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who should black America,</v>

839
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>

840
00:39:36.531 --> 00:39:40.600
<v Speaker 1>it's so stupid talking about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like who should be in your opinion,</v>

841
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:43.840
<v Speaker 1>should the community be turning to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make some sense of this?</v>

842
00:39:43.841 --> 00:39:44.674
<v Speaker 1>Because there's the usual cast of </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and we can name all the ones </v>

843
00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:50.110
<v Speaker 1>that you don't like that or on msnbc </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday and I don't like him either,</v>

844
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.100
<v Speaker 1>so let's just forget those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people that we should be looking at</v>

845
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.110
<v Speaker 1>that and I don't even mean just black </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

846
00:39:56.111 --> 00:39:59.020
<v Speaker 1>but no for people that really care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

847
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.760
<v Speaker 1>So you make the good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

848
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America generally,</v>

849
00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can identify someone who is sane</v>

850
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:08.380
<v Speaker 1>and rational and logical and thoughtful.</v>

851
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.320
<v Speaker 1>But in the african american community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've nailed it.</v>

852
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.423
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a generation of leaders and they </v>

853
00:40:13.961 --> 00:40:16.810
<v Speaker 1>were right for that era and what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

854
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Fast forward 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>

855
00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've actually sat with a group of my</v>

856
00:40:21.521 --> 00:40:22.480
<v Speaker 1>counterpart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

857
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.630
<v Speaker 1>forties successful and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the leader?</v>

858
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.493
<v Speaker 1>Who's the voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what voice captures what's happening in </v>

859
00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 1>african american community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

860
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:32.460
<v Speaker 1>to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not monolithic.</v>

861
00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.640
<v Speaker 1>African americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

862
00:40:33.641 --> 00:40:36.310
<v Speaker 1>like any other guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't like it,</v>

863
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was never modeled that they put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had leaders.</v>

864
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Martin luther king was a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you know,</v>

865
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.560
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't from industry,</v>

866
00:40:44.561 --> 00:40:45.371
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

867
00:40:45.371 --> 00:40:48.310
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still he represented just,</v>

868
00:40:48.311 --> 00:40:51.880
<v Speaker 1>he caught and captured the voice of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

869
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I have to honestly say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that bothers me.</v>

870
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:55.893
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who that person is and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not so sure that if you asked </v>

871
00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:02.170
<v Speaker 1>him lack people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine of them would say,</v>

872
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure who that leader is.</v>

873
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so complex because you remember</v>

874
00:41:05.471 --> 00:41:06.304
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years ago when oprah said </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about how well we just need </v>

875
00:41:09.191 --> 00:41:12.080
<v Speaker 1>these old racists to die and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>referencing,</v>

876
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:13.023
<v Speaker 1>she was referencing some people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmothers and grandfathers and I </v>

877
00:41:14.981 --> 00:41:17.630
<v Speaker 1>remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have no beef with open,</v>

878
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.700
<v Speaker 1>but I remember hearing that and thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so dangerous.</v>

879
00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:24.940
<v Speaker 1>It gets back to what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about earlier about how You just live in</v>

880
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:25.774
<v Speaker 1>your times and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no one wants to look at their </v>

881
00:41:27.461 --> 00:41:29.920
<v Speaker 1>grandparents who live grew up in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different time of thing.</v>

882
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I had to wait until you just drop dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't vote anymore with it.</v>

883
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And it</v>

884
00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.360
<v Speaker 2>makes me think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

885
00:41:35.361 --> 00:41:38.810
<v Speaker 2>I had my grandmother taught school for </v>
<v Speaker 2>46 years in broward county,</v>

886
00:41:38.811 --> 00:41:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

887
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I remember she said something to me now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the world of my grandmother,</v>

888
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 2>she's still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>93 years old,</v>

889
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.080
<v Speaker 2>94.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just had a birthdaY.</v>

890
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.273
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember going down to the university </v>

891
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:56.291
<v Speaker 2>of miami and I came home and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've met someone and it was,</v>

892
00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 2>she assumed it was a white woman because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at a majority institution,</v>

893
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lily white,</v>

894
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:05.060
<v Speaker 2>university of miami.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

895
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:07.620
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather you bring a man home that,</v>

896
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:08.483
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now this is someone who I adore and I </v>

897
00:42:13.161 --> 00:42:16.280
<v Speaker 2>think the world of her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I had to stop and pause.</v>

898
00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:17.114
<v Speaker 2>It stuck me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that I'd rather you bring a </v>

899
00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 2>manhole than a white woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had to realize that a lot of folks</v>

900
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 2>hold these racial things and they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>products of their era like,</v>

901
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:28.640
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

902
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.140
<v Speaker 2>so when I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

903
00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:34.370
<v Speaker 2>an older 90 year old lady or old white </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who has an harbor,</v>

904
00:42:34.371 --> 00:42:37.240
<v Speaker 2>some racial animus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't around then,</v>

905
00:42:37.241 --> 00:42:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I can't really put that in context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not justifying it,</v>

906
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:40.694
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's right or wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I am saying to your earlier </v>

907
00:42:42.921 --> 00:42:43.754
<v Speaker 2>point is I love my grandmother and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you tried to attack my grandmother </v>

908
00:42:47.361 --> 00:42:52.361
<v Speaker 2>because she espoused that worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would attack you because I look at the</v>

909
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:56.480
<v Speaker 2>totality of her contributions to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and her,</v>

910
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.343
<v Speaker 2>her racist tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a product of the era that she </v>

911
00:43:00.591 --> 00:43:02.660
<v Speaker 2>grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are also a very,</v>

912
00:43:02.661 --> 00:43:05.030
<v Speaker 2>very small part of the full woman that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

913
00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the key part.</v>

914
00:43:06.561 --> 00:43:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants to define everything you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said earlier.</v>

915
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 2>You could figure out some thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>did when you were 18.</v>

916
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.580
<v Speaker 2>something that I did when I was 26 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go man,</v>

917
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.990
<v Speaker 2>affordances that matter.</v>

918
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:17.781
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

919
00:43:17.781 --> 00:43:21.410
<v Speaker 2>But that's the point that we're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces of all of this.</v>

920
00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to.</v>

921
00:43:22.581 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>

922
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:27.950
<v Speaker 2>we just want to collapse on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that someone did that,</v>

923
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:32.730
<v Speaker 2>by the way unpopular now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think a martin luther king,</v>

924
00:43:32.731 --> 00:43:36.130
<v Speaker 2>we would think about the identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics stuff it.</v>

925
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 2>It's I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to think,</v>

926
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:39.643
<v Speaker 2>and by the way I say that because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>read so many versions of what martin </v>

927
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.963
<v Speaker 2>fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people say he was a </v>

928
00:43:44.511 --> 00:43:46.520
<v Speaker 2>republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I've heard people help he,</v>

929
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 2>he's a womanizer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said this,</v>

930
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:48.494
<v Speaker 2>you just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can make an interesting </v>

931
00:43:50.031 --> 00:43:53.110
<v Speaker 2>argument that he was a conservative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>endow a.</v>

932
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.370
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want his children to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>judged by the color of their skin.</v>

933
00:43:55.371 --> 00:43:56.204
<v Speaker 2>That actually sounds a little more like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a conservative idea because that's not </v>

934
00:43:58.881 --> 00:44:00.350
<v Speaker 2>an identity politics idea yet.</v>

935
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Hit a lot of his economic stuff was </v>
<v Speaker 2>veering more towards socialism in a way,</v>

936
00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:07.340
<v Speaker 2>so I think you can argue both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think on balance,</v>

937
00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 2>I think he would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that he would be looking.</v>

938
00:44:11.871 --> 00:44:14.240
<v Speaker 2>He's looking down and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

939
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.560
<v Speaker 2>no system is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No set of rules is perfect,</v>

940
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:19.663
<v Speaker 2>but this is a lot better people today </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it was what we inherited back then </v>

941
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:26.653
<v Speaker 2>is far worse than what you have today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why don't we look at the progress </v>

942
00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 2>that was made and figure out how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>build on it.</v>

943
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to think that because his </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature was one of working together,</v>

944
00:44:35.491 --> 00:44:38.580
<v Speaker 2>finding commonality and peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 2>protests,</v>

945
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people now you know not allowing people </v>

946
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:45.780
<v Speaker 2>to talk when you disagree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally shouting them down.</v>

947
00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Think about that era when martin luther </v>
<v Speaker 2>king,</v>

948
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.490
<v Speaker 2>we were the minority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were clearly,</v>

949
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:51.383
<v Speaker 2>I mean really in the minority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally they could have silenced him </v>

950
00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.200
<v Speaker 2>by yelling and shouting him down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow the country allow that voice to,</v>

951
00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:03.960
<v Speaker 2>to and people embraced it because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to it.</v>

952
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:07.350
<v Speaker 2>Even people who were probably not </v>
<v Speaker 2>inclined to agree with him,</v>

953
00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:09.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that that time,</v>

954
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:10.800
<v Speaker 2>but by listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

955
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:12.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's done to something,</v>

956
00:45:12.901 --> 00:45:15.780
<v Speaker 2>and it really piqued their heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got to the heart and said,</v>

957
00:45:15.781 --> 00:45:16.614
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is probably not the right way to </v>

958
00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:22.080
<v Speaker 2>think about my fellow americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was because they listened,</v>

959
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.990
<v Speaker 2>but if you aren't even being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can't hear,</v>

960
00:45:24.991 --> 00:45:28.110
<v Speaker 2>if you're unwilling to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin has to be sad right now.</v>

961
00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

962
00:45:30.151 --> 00:45:30.984
<v Speaker 1>at the moment I was telling me how is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this an dc going all these things and </v>

963
00:45:33.781 --> 00:45:34.614
<v Speaker 1>that's what I felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just felt things had gotten so much </v>

964
00:45:37.111 --> 00:45:38.990
<v Speaker 1>better for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

965
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:39.993
<v Speaker 1>There isn't racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean some people don't like </v>

966
00:45:41.641 --> 00:45:45.120
<v Speaker 1>gay people or any of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are.</v>

967
00:45:45.121 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Laws basically are fair and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>where else are they doing it better?</v>

968
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.900
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you looking to move somewhere?</v>

969
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:52.853
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing right after even after </v>

970
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:55.170
<v Speaker 1>the trump election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

971
00:45:55.171 --> 00:45:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I remembered all of those folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he is elected,</v>

972
00:45:56.881 --> 00:45:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaving the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

973
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm still here and I check every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's still here.</v>

974
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:03.984
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these folks with rosie and the </v>

975
00:46:05.041 --> 00:46:07.140
<v Speaker 1>name of the group who all thought they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were gonna leave the country.</v>

976
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going anywhere.</v>

977
00:46:08.311 --> 00:46:09.144
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>

978
00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go too far down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump thing unless you want to go there,</v>

979
00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.510
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that whatever's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening with him right now,</v>

980
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 1>and as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we're taping this today,</v>

981
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:18.683
<v Speaker 1>manafort was indicted by the fbi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like it's not even directly </v>

982
00:46:22.681 --> 00:46:23.514
<v Speaker 1>about the trump campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's about some Ukraine stuff </v>

983
00:46:25.771 --> 00:46:26.340
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

984
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.580
<v Speaker 1>but we'll see where all that plays out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a general rule,</v>

985
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.040
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of what's happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because to me,</v>

986
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 1>what I keep trying to say is if you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>let go of the tweets for a minute,</v>

987
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.183
<v Speaker 1>you let go over the media hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically nothing bad has happened </v>

988
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

989
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two things.</v>

990
00:46:44.521 --> 00:46:45.354
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>y'all.</v>

991
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.740
<v Speaker 2>I know it's hard to get rid of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

992
00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:48.050
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've only had eight months of it,</v>

993
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.820
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing bad could really happen at eight</v>

994
00:46:50.821 --> 00:46:51.654
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

995
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 2>This is a republic that has been around </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time.</v>

996
00:46:54.121 --> 00:46:56.130
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be around a long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>after him.</v>

997
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:56.993
<v Speaker 2>So that's the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is it goes back to this </v>

998
00:46:59.311 --> 00:47:01.120
<v Speaker 2>media thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If You are,</v>

999
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:05.640
<v Speaker 2>if you continually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a barrage of information.</v>

1000
00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:07.770
<v Speaker 2>It says everything this person does is </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

1001
00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:09.790
<v Speaker 2>At some point you believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1002
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.410
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to figure it out.</v>

1003
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Could he stay off the tweet a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit?</v>

1004
00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Twitter off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1005
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Could he be a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential?</v>

1006
00:47:19.261 --> 00:47:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he admitted it this weekend when he said</v>

1007
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.013
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm about to say about Michael </v>

1008
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Morton is totally non presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well knows alert president trump.</v>

1009
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Several of those sorts of things have </v>
<v Speaker 2>not been president,</v>

1010
00:47:28.891 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 2>so I'm glad you're acknowledging</v>

1011
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.033
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1012
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:31.991
<v Speaker 1>he can't though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1013
00:47:31.991 --> 00:47:32.824
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what got them there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's got him there and that's </v>

1014
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:36.670
<v Speaker 1>what people forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It worked and frankly,</v>

1015
00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:40.270
<v Speaker 1>as much as we talk about he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflecting America.</v>

1016
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1017
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>43 million americans voted for him.</v>

1018
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Forty six for hillary and people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor the sin,</v>

1019
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:48.124
<v Speaker 1>but $3 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary won the state of great state of </v>

1020
00:47:49.811 --> 00:47:54.640
<v Speaker 1>California by 3 million votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>people forget that.</v>

1021
00:47:54.641 --> 00:47:55.980
<v Speaker 1>So pull those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That $3,</v>

1022
00:47:55.981 --> 00:47:59.620
<v Speaker 1>million person spread was like here for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the record.</v>

1023
00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:00.454
<v Speaker 1>I in California voted for Gary Johnson </v>
<v Speaker 1>and judge me however you will see </v>

1024
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.223
<v Speaker 1>another judge me however you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect you would do I feel that </v>

1025
00:48:08.371 --> 00:48:10.740
<v Speaker 1>of the ideas of gary did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact I did that,</v>

1026
00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know he wasn't going to win so that's</v>

1027
00:48:13.121 --> 00:48:14.410
<v Speaker 1>a whole different conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

1028
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:15.790
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in California.</v>

1029
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.910
<v Speaker 1>It didn't matter which way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1030
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.920
<v Speaker 1>That's like me in Washington dc for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic candidate was when full stop.</v>

1031
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1032
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.590
<v Speaker 1>And again that gets back to the issue is</v>
<v Speaker 1>country is just,</v>

1033
00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:27.493
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in one camp or the other and it </v>

1034
00:48:29.261 --> 00:48:32.930
<v Speaker 1>is when you think 46 and 43 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people we're calling,</v>

1035
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.823
<v Speaker 1>we really divided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just don't even know where the </v>

1036
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:38.030
<v Speaker 1>center is anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1037
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.270
<v Speaker 1>that's troubling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>

1038
00:48:40.271 --> 00:48:41.104
<v Speaker 1>the center basically is somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically conservative in that you </v>

1039
00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:46.960
<v Speaker 1>earn your money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should keep it.</v>

1040
00:48:46.961 --> 00:48:49.600
<v Speaker 1>And I also always argued that's the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1041
00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:50.523
<v Speaker 1>If you hate trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to limit government is to </v>

1042
00:48:52.421 --> 00:48:56.590
<v Speaker 1>stop giving it so much money and power </v>
<v Speaker 1>because sometime you know what?</v>

1043
00:48:56.591 --> 00:48:59.590
<v Speaker 1>You might get bernie and he can use a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of power that you like,</v>

1044
00:48:59.591 --> 00:49:00.970
<v Speaker 1>but then sometimes you're gonna get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy you don't like,</v>

1045
00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:03.010
<v Speaker 1>so let's just stop giving them so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

1046
00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:04.210
<v Speaker 1>but in a weird way.</v>

1047
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Does This all show that our system is </v>
<v Speaker 1>working properly?</v>

1048
00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1049
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:08.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1050
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:12.010
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned it earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a perfect system,</v>

1051
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.400
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other place in the world.</v>

1052
00:49:14.401 --> 00:49:15.234
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thank god every day when I wake up </v>

1053
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:18.750
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1054
00:49:18.751 --> 00:49:19.584
<v Speaker 1>and so you know that I'm here and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we could have all been born </v>

1055
00:49:22.151 --> 00:49:24.640
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else and this could have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really bad situation.</v>

1056
00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:25.474
<v Speaker 1>It's not a perfect union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're working towards it and that's </v>

1057
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:28.923
<v Speaker 1>the optimism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's only if we have conversations </v>

1058
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two of us,</v>

1059
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:35.680
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't appear on mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>television by the way.</v>

1060
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that I got to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to get you.</v>

1061
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me be your age,</v>

1062
00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.570
<v Speaker 1>but we have to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you could do it.</v>

1063
00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.413
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know that I want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe that really could because </v>

1064
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:48.880
<v Speaker 1>this voice is what's missing.</v>

1065
00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:49.773
<v Speaker 1>You're either msnbc or fox news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're rachel or your hannity and that </v>

1066
00:49:54.551 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get us any closer to fixing this</v>

1067
00:49:57.401 --> 00:49:58.234
<v Speaker 1>because people then divide out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's What we've got to do because </v>

1068
00:50:01.241 --> 00:50:02.074
<v Speaker 1>rational people can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think reasonable people can come to </v>

1069
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:07.840
<v Speaker 1>some conclusions that this is good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us.</v>

1070
00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.033
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relating this to sort of where we </v>

1071
00:50:09.941 --> 00:50:12.010
<v Speaker 1>started as you're saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>

1072
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something interesting here.</v>

1073
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:17.800
<v Speaker 1>If this identity politics stuff wins the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and they start taking more monuments</v>

1074
00:50:17.801 --> 00:50:18.634
<v Speaker 1>and we start judging Thomas Jefferson </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rest of the founders on the </v>

1075
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.270
<v Speaker 1>morals of today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that we'll remove them,</v>

1076
00:50:25.271 --> 00:50:28.150
<v Speaker 1>but we'll actually all of good ideas,</v>

1077
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.310
<v Speaker 2>all of their good ideas will have to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1078
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.940
<v Speaker 2>They won't even if you're like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those good ideas,</v>

1079
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:35.990
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they won't just magically keep some</v>

1080
00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:36.824
<v Speaker 2>of the ideas what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually remove all of those ideas and </v>

1081
00:50:38.601 --> 00:50:42.180
<v Speaker 2>then what are we left with and it ain't </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty right and,</v>

1082
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.530
<v Speaker 2>and it's not America that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

1083
00:50:45.531 --> 00:50:46.364
<v Speaker 2>It's not America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that we've all got </v>

1084
00:50:48.191 --> 00:50:52.740
<v Speaker 2>to come to grips with is that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a good direction.</v>

1085
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.520
<v Speaker 2>The trajectory is all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pleased to say,</v>

1086
00:50:55.521 --> 00:50:56.354
<v Speaker 2>and all of us in the market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so performing the financially you'll do </v>

1087
00:50:58.671 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by the way,</v>

1088
00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:00.494
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have any money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not participating in the markets </v>

1089
00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:02.853
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1090
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.430
<v Speaker 2>So people like the two of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do fine.</v>

1091
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Our families and significant others and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stakeholders are going to do fine.</v>

1092
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:10.663
<v Speaker 2>It's the rest of these folks who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being left out and they unfortunately </v>

1093
00:51:13.011 --> 00:51:18.011
<v Speaker 2>are buying into this narrative that </v>
<v Speaker 2>America is bad and somehow the magic fix</v>

1094
00:51:19.501 --> 00:51:24.020
<v Speaker 2>is to tax the wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where does that end?</v>

1095
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:24.913
<v Speaker 2>Like who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so is the appeal of that just </v>

1096
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 2>because it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of lazy thinking,</v>

1097
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:32.031
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1098
00:51:32.031 --> 00:51:35.840
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't take much to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want what somebody else has.</v>

1099
00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of an easy answer.</v>

1100
00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:40.340
<v Speaker 2>like I don't have somebody all got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should gIve me some of that.</v>

1101
00:51:40.341 --> 00:51:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have to think that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relax.</v>

1102
00:51:42.701 --> 00:51:43.534
<v Speaker 2>You have to think harder to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>why you shouldn't or don't deserve </v>

1103
00:51:46.341 --> 00:51:47.780
<v Speaker 2>someone else's money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

1104
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1105
00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:50.210
<v Speaker 2>and why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1106
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:55.230
<v Speaker 2>But it's also equally lazy to think if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>were a zoo,</v>

1107
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a millionaire,</v>

1108
00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to give more of my money</v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone else if I earned it.</v>

1109
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Even if I bought a freaking lottery </v>
<v Speaker 2>ticket,</v>

1110
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:03.801
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1111
00:52:03.801 --> 00:52:04.634
<v Speaker 2>just basic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take some person who's from a fragile </v>

1112
00:52:06.531 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 2>community and who's got limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources and you say to them,</v>

1113
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:11.990
<v Speaker 2>you won the lottery tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want $2,000,000,</v>

1114
00:52:11.991 --> 00:52:14.390
<v Speaker 2>5 million of it goes to the federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>government in your state.</v>

1115
00:52:14.391 --> 00:52:16.670
<v Speaker 2>How does that make you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad.</v>

1116
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:19.520
<v Speaker 2>That's lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1117
00:52:19.521 --> 00:52:22.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a lot to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good result,</v>

1118
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1119
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.020
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know why this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it's easy.</v>

1120
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:29.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have just pounded into people's heads</v>

1121
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:33.860
<v Speaker 2>that taking that the rich people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

1122
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:34.723
<v Speaker 2>you're vilified for going to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday and making some good decisions </v>

1123
00:52:38.271 --> 00:52:40.430
<v Speaker 2>and some luck and some god and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>fate.</v>

1124
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:41.443
<v Speaker 2>All of that into totality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're bad for having done well and the </v>

1125
00:52:44.601 --> 00:52:46.730
<v Speaker 2>media plays it consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1126
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:49.070
<v Speaker 2>you belIeve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe it.</v>

1127
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:52.310
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is the right amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>government for us to have?</v>

1128
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as we need.</v>

1129
00:52:54.381 --> 00:52:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I know that's not a great answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would literally,</v>

1130
00:52:57.141 --> 00:52:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sort of,</v>

1131
00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm very conservative in that respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can have no government</v>

1132
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.130
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] then you have anarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need.</v>

1133
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.320
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want mad max,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1134
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if my house burns down,</v>

1135
00:53:07.191 --> 00:53:08.024
<v Speaker 2>I want to police department to show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna have to rely on my three </v>

1136
00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:13.040
<v Speaker 2>neighbors with buckets to come at a fire</v>
<v Speaker 2>department to show up.</v>

1137
00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.053
<v Speaker 2>So I think government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the infrastructure is important of any </v>

1138
00:53:16.521 --> 00:53:17.354
<v Speaker 2>society that will endure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that we've gotten too far </v>

1139
00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:21.284
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have just huge bureaucracy and </v>

1140
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>departments designed to</v>

1141
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 1>solve problems that frankly will solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves amongst people.</v>

1142
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:31.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we become completely dependent on </v>

1143
00:53:32.431 --> 00:53:33.870
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any way to scale it back?</v>

1144
00:53:33.871 --> 00:53:34.704
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the questions that I try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask a lot of my more libertarian </v>

1145
00:53:36.961 --> 00:53:37.794
<v Speaker 1>guests like it seems like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing has gotten so big and when </v>

1146
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you factor it in with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1147
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 1>handouts and all of this stuff that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were ever to take it back,</v>

1148
00:53:47.761 --> 00:53:48.421
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1149
00:53:48.421 --> 00:53:50.610
<v Speaker 1>you just be screwing over all the poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that.</v>

1150
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Then I have some people who come on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1151
00:53:52.201 --> 00:53:54.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just cut it tomorrow and we see what</v>

1152
00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:56.180
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll charities come in.</v>

1153
00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:59.220
<v Speaker 1>We'll churches and synagogues and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mosques and all that.</v>

1154
00:53:59.221 --> 00:54:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pick up the slack,</v>

1155
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:01.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

1156
00:54:01.171 --> 00:54:02.004
<v Speaker 1>If you cut the funding until planned </v>
<v Speaker 1>parenthood would barbara streisand and </v>

1157
00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 1>rosie and the rest of them suddenly put </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of their money towards that.</v>

1158
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.720
<v Speaker 1>I tend to think the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1159
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.633
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get that point across to </v>

1160
00:54:12.841 --> 00:54:13.680
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1161
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to do it unless forced</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>

1162
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.380
<v Speaker 1>so I think so that's something to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>said for.</v>

1163
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1164
00:54:20.461 --> 00:54:22.650
<v Speaker 1>what we saw puerto rico's a classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

1165
00:54:22.651 --> 00:54:24.220
<v Speaker 1>We're all forced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1166
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:26.010
<v Speaker 1>worried about what's happening in puerto</v>
<v Speaker 1>rico,</v>

1167
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:30.450
<v Speaker 1>but this didn't start with a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto rico was a disaster.</v>

1168
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I read something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was down there last year and they said</v>

1169
00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:34.284
<v Speaker 1>70 or so percent of the population work </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the government like that has gotten </v>

1170
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.400
<v Speaker 1>out of control and the only way you fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1171
00:54:41.401 --> 00:54:42.750
<v Speaker 1>you can't come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

1172
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:44.183
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of you all should give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your government jobs for us to get this </v>

1173
00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:47.670
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1174
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:49.250
<v Speaker 1>you're just gonna have to kind of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be.</v>

1175
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 1>You just have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the.</v>

1176
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:52.643
<v Speaker 1>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the opportunity and I want to be </v>

1177
00:54:54.181 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 1>careful here because I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1178
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a trump sarah got or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

1179
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:01.740
<v Speaker 1>but that's the opportunity for someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like him.</v>

1180
00:55:01.741 --> 00:55:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I think we have just elected our first </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent president.</v>

1181
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the first time that America</v>
<v Speaker 1>has had someone who says what they think</v>

1182
00:55:08.971 --> 00:55:09.804
<v Speaker 1>for good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but and who is prepared to be unpopular </v>

1183
00:55:12.811 --> 00:55:13.644
<v Speaker 1>because to make these sorts of decisions</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to be unpopular and okay with </v>

1184
00:55:17.521 --> 00:55:18.354
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was that his best line during the </v>

1185
00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:20.364
<v Speaker 1>campaign?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he said basically to the black </v>

1186
00:55:21.931 --> 00:55:22.860
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1187
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:25.020
<v Speaker 1>what do you got to lose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>

1188
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:27.720
<v Speaker 1>It was an actual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ended up being a good line because it</v>

1189
00:55:27.721 --> 00:55:28.554
<v Speaker 1>sounded off when I heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I've talked to a lot of people </v>

1190
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:33.840
<v Speaker 1>and they kind of were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1191
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.960
<v Speaker 1>all these democratic run cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicago,</v>

1192
00:55:36.961 --> 00:55:37.950
<v Speaker 1>atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ferguson.</v>

1193
00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:40.530
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was funny.</v>

1194
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:41.670
<v Speaker 1>I remembered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew,</v>

1195
00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:42.563
<v Speaker 1>I know where I was at that moment when </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened and I was with a group of </v>

1196
00:55:45.001 --> 00:55:48.270
<v Speaker 1>my friends and one of my friends who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>as liberal as they come,</v>

1197
00:55:48.271 --> 00:55:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I've never sent me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drips and he said to me,</v>

1198
00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:55.770
<v Speaker 1>it was this moment like when you eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's bitter at first,</v>

1199
00:55:55.771 --> 00:55:56.341
<v Speaker 1>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1200
00:55:56.341 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 1>that tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately.</v>

1201
00:55:57.721 --> 00:56:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said he's onto something and that</v>

1202
00:56:00.961 --> 00:56:05.220
<v Speaker 1>was when I knew that actually resonated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel good at first.</v>

1203
00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:06.054
<v Speaker 1>I mean I got it checked because it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little dismissive and frankly the </v>

1204
00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:11.634
<v Speaker 1>african american community is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoying the fact that we elected our </v>

1205
00:56:15.601 --> 00:56:16.434
<v Speaker 1>first african american president and </v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly so are a lot of non african </v>

1206
00:56:19.731 --> 00:56:20.221
<v Speaker 1>americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1207
00:56:20.221 --> 00:56:21.054
<v Speaker 1>It was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they felt like it was a shot at </v>

1208
00:56:24.461 --> 00:56:25.220
<v Speaker 1>obama.</v>

1209
00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.440
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the issue.</v>

1210
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 1>If you had taken obama out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>

1211
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:33.850
<v Speaker 1>having been the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a totally reasonable statement to</v>

1212
00:56:33.851 --> 00:56:38.851
<v Speaker 1>say ever the guy was before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't meaningfully change your life.</v>

1213
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I am prepared to do what do you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose?</v>

1214
00:56:42.911 --> 00:56:43.744
<v Speaker 1>So I think you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took obama out of it and the </v>

1215
00:56:45.281 --> 00:56:48.070
<v Speaker 1>pride associated with him being a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1216
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.620
<v Speaker 1>a first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1217
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I think it was totally logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>

1218
00:56:52.271 --> 00:56:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I think you can make a great argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the president himself,</v>

1219
00:56:54.881 --> 00:56:56.530
<v Speaker 1>whether it's obama or trump or anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

1220
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:59.140
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have that much power over your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1221
00:56:59.240 --> 00:56:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1222
00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:03.070
<v Speaker 1>that would be my greater solutIon here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my attitude.</v>

1223
00:57:03.071 --> 00:57:03.600
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1224
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to have lunch with </v>

1225
00:57:05.621 --> 00:57:06.431
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1226
00:57:06.431 --> 00:57:07.850
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1227
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:11.650
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my president to do two things.</v>

1228
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:12.663
<v Speaker 1>Literally I have sort of drawn it down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this national security and economic </v>

1229
00:57:17.831 --> 00:57:18.370
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>

1230
00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I want the economy economy to be strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>globally.</v>

1231
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I want them on it and then I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that the homeland is secure in</v>

1232
00:57:24.251 --> 00:57:27.100
<v Speaker 1>the context of a global kind of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not just domestic,</v>

1233
00:57:27.101 --> 00:57:29.560
<v Speaker 1>but you got to do some things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationally to protect your homeland.</v>

1234
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:30.873
<v Speaker 1>Those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what the president thinks </v>

1235
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:37.150
<v Speaker 1>about much of anything because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man just like I am and you are,</v>

1236
00:57:37.151 --> 00:57:40.060
<v Speaker 1>so he'll have an opinion about x and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good for him.</v>

1237
00:57:40.061 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Their supreme court does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress has all of that stuff,</v>

1238
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:43.353
<v Speaker 1>but I just want them to do two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Economic security and what I'll call </v>

1239
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:49.060
<v Speaker 1>homeland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but security,</v>

1240
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:49.923
<v Speaker 1>national security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it funny to you how everybody's sort </v>

1241
00:57:52.331 --> 00:57:54.730
<v Speaker 1>of flipped their opinions on almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything these days?</v>

1242
00:57:54.731 --> 00:57:55.564
<v Speaker 1>Because as you're saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking if we just go back 20 </v>

1243
00:57:57.551 --> 00:57:59.620
<v Speaker 1>minutes when we were talking about daca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1244
00:57:59.621 --> 00:58:00.454
<v Speaker 1>well suddenly democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't like what trump was </v>

1245
00:58:01.871 --> 00:58:02.470
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1246
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:04.330
<v Speaker 1>We're fighting for states' rights and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1247
00:58:04.331 --> 00:58:05.164
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you guys to fight rights all the </v>

1248
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:07.324
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>could then I'll start voting with you </v>

1249
00:58:07.991 --> 00:58:09.820
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at the obamacare,</v>

1250
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:13.340
<v Speaker 1>the new proposed a affordable health </v>
<v Speaker 1>care act.</v>

1251
00:58:13.341 --> 00:58:13.931
<v Speaker 1>By that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1252
00:58:13.931 --> 00:58:17.500
<v Speaker 1>the idea is black granite to the states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's what we all want,</v>

1253
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.593
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's and I was surprised to see some </v>

1254
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:21.100
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1255
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.970
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want it.</v>

1256
00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:25.240
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean you don't want it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability of mr or ms.gov</v>

1257
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.253
<v Speaker 1>to manage and take care of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizenry with your dollars without the </v>

1258
00:58:29.081 --> 00:58:29.914
<v Speaker 1>intervention of some people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington dc who know nothing about </v>

1259
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:34.450
<v Speaker 1>what happens in spokane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>

1260
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.823
<v Speaker 1>You don't want man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me that's like the most like perfect </v>

1261
00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:38.914
<v Speaker 1>example of how screwed up our system is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a governor who is executor of the </v>

1262
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:43.240
<v Speaker 1>estate would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1263
00:58:43.241 --> 00:58:43.571
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1264
00:58:43.571 --> 00:58:45.160
<v Speaker 1>The thing that I'm supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do,</v>

1265
00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:47.890
<v Speaker 1>let's send it over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way I'm free in the clear.</v>

1266
00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:50.860
<v Speaker 1>That's like the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people hate politicians.</v>

1267
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:52.850
<v Speaker 1>That's why people hate the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like holding it.</v>

1268
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in California,</v>

1269
00:58:54.671 --> 00:58:55.504
<v Speaker 1>which they're probably going to execute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in five years for a little freedom </v>

1270
00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:02.500
<v Speaker 1>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>

1271
00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:04.510
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they succeed from the unit,</v>

1272
00:59:04.511 --> 00:59:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I really can I move in with you.</v>

1273
00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the Iowa,</v>

1274
00:59:12.461 --> 00:59:13.460
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1275
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:17.350
<v Speaker 1>But that point basically of everything's</v>
<v Speaker 1>being flipped right now.</v>

1276
00:59:17.351 --> 00:59:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone's kind of all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1277
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:21.530
<v Speaker 1>It's actually cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's all I know.</v>

1278
00:59:21.531 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 1>So many people</v>

1279
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:23.023
<v Speaker 2>are depressed about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I've been trying to say is </v>

1280
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.770
<v Speaker 2>there's opportunity here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean it's going to be bad.</v>

1281
00:59:27.771 --> 00:59:28.604
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean it's going to be good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's get in there and fight for </v>

1282
00:59:30.771 --> 00:59:31.604
<v Speaker 2>what you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you believe in the stuff that I </v>

1283
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:34.700
<v Speaker 2>abhor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1284
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're lazy.</v>

1285
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean that you use the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are lazy.</v>

1286
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:41.750
<v Speaker 2>This is actually fascinating to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I want to separate it.</v>

1287
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Earlier I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1288
00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm nervous about where this is going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1289
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.353
<v Speaker 2>I'm hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not necessarily optimistic and </v>

1290
00:59:49.041 --> 00:59:50.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1291
00:59:50.391 --> 00:59:54.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do enjoy watching the process,</v>

1292
00:59:54.501 --> 00:59:57.530
<v Speaker 2>the sausage making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do like to see that ultimately,</v>

1293
00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go back and look at some of the,</v>

1294
00:59:59.871 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 2>at least the reports of the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>founding fathers,</v>

1295
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:03.980
<v Speaker 2>it was ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hated each other.</v>

1296
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.813
<v Speaker 2>It was divided like nothing you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen and all of the what we refer to as </v>

1297
01:00:09.071 --> 01:00:10.610
<v Speaker 2>going on in congress right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hell,</v>

1298
01:00:10.611 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 2>it happened back then to this might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the american experience.</v>

1299
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you were just in time.</v>

1300
01:00:18.111 --> 01:00:18.944
<v Speaker 2>What we do is we put a painting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tell a story around it and it looks </v>

1301
01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:25.160
<v Speaker 2>so wonderful and dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is it's ugly.</v>

1302
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>operating in this sort of a government,</v>

1303
01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.540
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this model of,</v>

1304
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:30.523
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of governing is ugly and it's got to be </v>

1305
01:00:33.051 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Speaker 2>ugly or I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the option?</v>

1306
01:00:34.701 --> 01:00:35.534
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what people don't </v>

1307
01:00:36.141 --> 01:00:38.600
<v Speaker 2>understand is like if anything's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work,</v>

1308
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.570
<v Speaker 2>it kind of has to be ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That mean the sausage factory there.</v>

1309
01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.280
<v Speaker 2>I think nobody wants to see how it gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>

1310
01:00:43.281 --> 01:00:44.210
<v Speaker 2>but you don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1311
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Shit like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I was,</v>

1312
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:46.910
<v Speaker 2>I was reading the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you've seen it,</v>

1313
01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:47.900
<v Speaker 2>the comments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1314
01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 2>vayner is now talking about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

1315
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god suddenly the man's curse of his </v>

1316
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 2>marines and the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1317
01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:56.913
<v Speaker 2>some way literally he said got either </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled a gun or a knife on him or </v>

1318
01:00:59.361 --> 01:00:59.750
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1319
01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.320
<v Speaker 2>One of his fellow members of congress </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1320
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:05.900
<v Speaker 2>iT's just fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally he's had an and but that's.</v>

1321
01:01:05.901 --> 01:01:10.901
<v Speaker 2>And that's within the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that somehow the tension is,</v>

1322
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.950
<v Speaker 2>is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not so much.</v>

1323
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also funny because like,</v>

1324
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll always hear all the,</v>

1325
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.080
<v Speaker 2>all these media people and politicians </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>

1326
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:23.360
<v Speaker 2>house of cards is the most realistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>show ever.</v>

1327
01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.493
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's an awful lot of murder and </v>

1328
01:01:25.341 --> 01:01:28.190
<v Speaker 2>drug use and evil backdoor deals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>

1329
01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:31.520
<v Speaker 2>you guys are all kind of telling us that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are all showing it to us.</v>

1330
01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:32.453
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we could go a rabbit hole on that </v>

1331
01:01:34.401 --> 01:01:35.210
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

1332
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:37.130
<v Speaker 2>let's shift to your future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you mentioned,</v>

1333
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.460
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you are leaving the organization that</v>

1334
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:42.220
<v Speaker 2>basically then the next month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1335
01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:43.173
<v Speaker 2>and where are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing going to run an </v>

1336
01:01:44.931 --> 01:01:48.050
<v Speaker 2>organization called the society for </v>
<v Speaker 2>human resource management?</v>

1337
01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the world's largest association</v>

1338
01:01:51.201 --> 01:01:52.034
<v Speaker 2>dedicated to human resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so trade association for the profession </v>

1339
01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.510
<v Speaker 2>of human resources professionals and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1340
01:01:58.550 --> 01:01:59.660
<v Speaker 2>so some have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1341
01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:00.523
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will know it isn't for for a couple of </v>

1342
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:03.830
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1343
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:05.870
<v Speaker 2>I've been in higher ed for the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven and a half years.</v>

1344
01:02:05.871 --> 01:02:08.360
<v Speaker 2>If you ask nine out of 10 college </v>
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>

1345
01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:11.780
<v Speaker 2>why did you go to college?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is to get a good job period.</v>

1346
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.793
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very natural kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no point of going if this </v>

1347
01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:19.770
<v Speaker 2>doesn't turn into some way to provide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing though is it's a natural</v>

1348
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 2>sort of evolution in my career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now understand higher ed.</v>

1349
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.313
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a really good </v>

1350
01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:29.670
<v Speaker 2>understanding of all of the education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pk through 16,</v>

1351
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:33.630
<v Speaker 2>we've now got a connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not an article that comes out.</v>

1352
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:36.720
<v Speaker 2>We're employers say the system is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving me what I want.</v>

1353
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.823
<v Speaker 2>The students who are graduating don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the skills that we need and so </v>

1354
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:40.884
<v Speaker 2>they're frustrated because I'm paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes to pay for this system education </v>

1355
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:45.900
<v Speaker 2>system and the what comes out on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other end.</v>

1356
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:49.590
<v Speaker 2>The assembly line model is really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I paid for all of this and at the end of</v>

1357
01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:50.424
<v Speaker 2>the car I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think this gives me an opportunitY </v>

1358
01:02:52.741 --> 01:02:56.330
<v Speaker 2>to take what I've done for the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven and a half years and now take,</v>

1359
01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.173
<v Speaker 2>get industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring the two together and say let's </v>

1360
01:02:59.071 --> 01:02:59.904
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to make this system work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're spending a lot of money as a </v>

1361
01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:03.294
<v Speaker 2>country on education and to what end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are some of the ways you could </v>

1362
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 2>shift education?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1363
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:09.744
<v Speaker 2>I think the basic premises of get people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to listen and get people to really </v>

1364
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:13.343
<v Speaker 2>understand what they believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is there something that's like a </v>

1365
01:03:14.401 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 2>little more concrete that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go in and be like,</v>

1366
01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:17.400
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's.</v>

1367
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.880
<v Speaker 2>This is what we got to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1368
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:20.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

1369
01:03:20.221 --> 01:03:22.830
<v Speaker 2>the current administration is talking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot about apprenticeships.</v>

1370
01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:23.664
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end gain can't be everyone goes to </v>

1371
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.333
<v Speaker 2>four year college and I think we went </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way for too long and that didn't </v>

1372
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:30.084
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is to figure out </v>

1373
01:03:31.351 --> 01:03:32.184
<v Speaker 2>credentialing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what are the specific </v>

1374
01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:34.974
<v Speaker 2>skills that one needs to go into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>21st century economy industry has to </v>

1375
01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:43.431
<v Speaker 2>tell us that since they are ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>the consumer of this education product,</v>

1376
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 2>and then we got to go back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1377
01:03:45.451 --> 01:03:46.284
<v Speaker 2>now you've got to tweak your system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you all don't like being </v>

1378
01:03:48.211 --> 01:03:51.180
<v Speaker 2>vocations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vocational schools and you want to teach</v>

1379
01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 2>people how to think and solve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world's problems,</v>

1380
01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.413
<v Speaker 2>but the vast majority of the folks who </v>
<v Speaker 2>come through your system are doing what </v>

1381
01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:58.170
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to get a job.</v>

1382
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.570
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Concretely.</v>

1383
01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Bringing those education and industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and say,</v>

1384
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.153
<v Speaker 2>let's figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to rethink and talking about </v>

1385
01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:08.244
<v Speaker 2>disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I predict that higher education in </v>

1386
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:13.410
<v Speaker 2>particular is going to be disrupted in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way as a,</v>

1387
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.940
<v Speaker 2>as a business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a sector,</v>

1388
01:04:14.941 --> 01:04:15.774
<v Speaker 2>like nothing you've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pieces are all there for that right </v>

1389
01:04:18.091 --> 01:04:18.924
<v Speaker 2>now because we see the schools that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the schools that have gone down </v>

1390
01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:22.224
<v Speaker 2>the sjw route are really struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mizzou is majorly struggling and </v>

1391
01:04:25.651 --> 01:04:28.560
<v Speaker 2>enrollment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know evergreen state struggling.</v>

1392
01:04:28.561 --> 01:04:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1393
01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:30.234
<v Speaker 2>you have another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>America and americans just had fewer </v>

1394
01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:34.610
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality is we,</v>

1395
01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.220
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1396
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.053
<v Speaker 2>we've seen there are fewer students </v>
<v Speaker 2>graduating high school this year than </v>

1397
01:04:39.481 --> 01:04:42.660
<v Speaker 2>last year and the year before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we're seeing is a problem.</v>

1398
01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:43.494
<v Speaker 2>You're just not going to have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of bodies to come into that </v>

1399
01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:50.820
<v Speaker 2>traditional college environment that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>created with dorms and everything else.</v>

1400
01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.330
<v Speaker 2>So now we are nontraditional student has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be our traditional students.</v>

1401
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:56.340
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be a little ironic for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way.</v>

1402
01:04:56.341 --> 01:04:57.174
<v Speaker 2>You come from the higher ed thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you care so much about it and yet you </v>

1403
01:04:58.801 --> 01:04:59.634
<v Speaker 2>can also acknowledge that a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of people just because of the </v>

1404
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:02.604
<v Speaker 2>reality of economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't necessarily need all of that </v>

1405
01:05:05.461 --> 01:05:08.550
<v Speaker 2>education that you know that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be lifelong,</v>

1406
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:09.713
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the idea that we came out of the </v>

1407
01:05:11.131 --> 01:05:13.080
<v Speaker 2>generation where you get your education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your bachelors,</v>

1408
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:14.610
<v Speaker 2>your masters or doctorate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what have you get,</v>

1409
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.593
<v Speaker 2>and then you go into the workplace and </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it for 30 years and you retire and </v>

1410
01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 2>now because the economy is changing so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

1411
01:05:22.211 --> 01:05:23.044
<v Speaker 2>every five to seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>industries go away that we were taught </v>

1412
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:28.180
<v Speaker 2>to participate in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go away.</v>

1413
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:30.700
<v Speaker 2>And so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so excited about that.</v>

1414
01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1415
01:05:31.901 --> 01:05:36.250
<v Speaker 2>sort of related to that America is </v>
<v Speaker 2>browning and graying at once.</v>

1416
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.533
<v Speaker 2>So underlying all of this is we've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out how to get the system to </v>

1417
01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:46.630
<v Speaker 2>appreciate a very different America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not black and white anymore.</v>

1418
01:05:46.631 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 2>It's brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's yellow,</v>

1419
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how these workers,</v>

1420
01:05:50.591 --> 01:05:51.424
<v Speaker 2>as they come out of college or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>their educational backgrounds are when </v>

1421
01:05:55.091 --> 01:05:57.820
<v Speaker 2>they come into the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we grow our economy?</v>

1422
01:05:58.090 --> 01:05:58.923
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've got to use people to do it </v>

1423
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.900
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm excited about,</v>

1424
01:06:01.901 --> 01:06:04.700
<v Speaker 2>sherman and higher education and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how to tie that all</v>

1425
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:05.700
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:06.551
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta tell you,</v>

1427
01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:06.751
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1428
01:06:06.751 --> 01:06:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I thoroughly enjoyed this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surprised because as I said,</v>

1429
01:06:09.521 --> 01:06:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I saw you once and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's going to do it.</v>

1430
01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:15.220
<v Speaker 2>But I think the real beauty of this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're not just saying this stuff,</v>

1431
01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:16.660
<v Speaker 2>you're actually out there doing it.</v>

1432
01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:19.240
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe,</v>

1433
01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:20.074
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't about my desire to run for </v>

1434
01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>office or to get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1435
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:26.770
<v Speaker 2>I really believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that it keeps me up at</v>

1436
01:06:26.771 --> 01:06:27.604
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can people like the two of us </v>

1437
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.550
<v Speaker 2>changed the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1438
01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I gotta I gotta give you one</v>

1439
01:06:35.351 --> 01:06:36.490
<v Speaker 2>more here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll all right.</v>

1440
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:37.990
<v Speaker 2>What would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say that.</v>

1441
01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:38.824
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

1442
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:41.500
<v Speaker 2>But what would you say then to the to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>

1443
01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:45.370
<v Speaker 2>whether they're college students right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now or whether they're middle aged,</v>

1444
01:06:45.371 --> 01:06:47.890
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that want to get in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

1445
01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:50.830
<v Speaker 2>but are afraid because of all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>silencing factors.</v>

1446
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.780
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1447
01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Know two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1448
01:06:52.871 --> 01:06:56.290
<v Speaker 2>you need courage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to intestinal courage.</v>

1449
01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:58.150
<v Speaker 2>You got to just go down and decide this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>

1450
01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:00.040
<v Speaker 2>this is where I want to go.</v>

1451
01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means transferring schools.</v>

1452
01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:04.143
<v Speaker 2>If that means changing the people you </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend time around because you know it </v>

1453
01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.990
<v Speaker 2>can be debilitating in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then do it.</v>

1454
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the only way to do it.</v>

1455
01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:14.650
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is I would encourage all</v>
<v Speaker 2>americans.</v>

1456
01:07:14.651 --> 01:07:15.484
<v Speaker 2>We've got to listen more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most frustrating thing to me now is </v>

1457
01:07:18.431 --> 01:07:19.264
<v Speaker 2>we're so busy talking and frankly </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking over others that we just won't </v>

1458
01:07:22.601 --> 01:07:23.434
<v Speaker 2>pause and listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the beginning of changing the </v>

1459
01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:28.900
<v Speaker 2>narrative because as you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to one,</v>

1460
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.990
<v Speaker 2>the other person will respect you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now because you've listened to them,</v>

1461
01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:34.570
<v Speaker 2>and in the process you actually might </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn something.</v>

1462
01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.500
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1463
01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:39.700
<v Speaker 2>the world is a little different than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived it to be because I got it from</v>

1464
01:07:39.701 --> 01:07:40.534
<v Speaker 2>someone else's perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the beauty of diversity by the </v>

1465
01:07:42.071 --> 01:07:42.904
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just gender and race and </v>

1466
01:07:44.591 --> 01:07:45.430
<v Speaker 2>national origin.</v>

1467
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 2>It's diverse perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How another person sees the world.</v>

1468
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:51.580
<v Speaker 2>If we can get those two things now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1469
01:07:51.581 --> 01:07:53.560
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then courage.</v>

1470
01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.380
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot frankly for me to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>

1471
01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:57.423
<v Speaker 2>the best thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I aspire to be a congressman and a </v>

1472
01:07:59.591 --> 01:08:01.570
<v Speaker 2>member of the cbc and dah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dah,</v>

1473
01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:04.180
<v Speaker 2>dah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a narrative that I'm supposed to</v>

1474
01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:07.750
<v Speaker 2>follow and you've got to decide that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that doesn't matter.</v>

1475
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:10.030
<v Speaker 2>What's more important is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>american story,</v>

1476
01:08:10.031 --> 01:08:10.864
<v Speaker 2>100 years from now is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a much better story because I was </v>

1477
01:08:13.691 --> 01:08:15.770
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1478
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:16.180
