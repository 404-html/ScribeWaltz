<v Speaker 1>University and author of the book </v>

5
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:23.530
<v Speaker 1>emancipating the slaves and slaving free</v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>a history of the American civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Rogers.</v>

7
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a pleasure to be on the Rubin </v>
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>We have already just in the few minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been sitting here,</v>

10
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>we talked about almost every other </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison right now.</v>

11
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're going to have to get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Lincoln guy.</v>

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

13
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first off,</v>

14
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>the obvious question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he actually a vampire hunter?</v>

15
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it.</v>

16
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not a show that I watched was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

17
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I forgot it was a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a documentary,</v>

18
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>but apparently not.</v>

19
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot I want to talk to you now.</v>

20
00:00:56.071 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>It was obvious when we were selecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>our five presidents to do this week,</v>

21
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to do some of some of the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones and some smaller ones.</v>

22
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully we'll do this for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>years to come and get to everybody.</v>

23
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>But Lincoln was the one I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

24
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>we got to do it because I think if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>polled most Americans,</v>

25
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>they always say that Lincoln is their </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite.</v>

26
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I think probably George Washington comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in second,</v>

27
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>but I think Lincoln is the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:18.984
<v Speaker 1>so I want to do a little bit on his bio </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I want to do obviously on the </v>

29
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>political stuff and civil war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>freeing the slaves.</v>

30
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:25.674
<v Speaker 1>And I want to talk about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting criticisms that you have of </v>

31
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>him in this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>but first let's just start a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about</v>

33
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 2>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where should we start a.</v>

34
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln was born in Kentucky,</v>

35
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.360
<v Speaker 2>a 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

36
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 2>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

37
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.460
<v Speaker 2>and grew up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very poor frontier household.</v>

38
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mother died when he was very young.</v>

39
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 2>It was partly raised by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

40
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 2>by a stepmother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They moved to Indiana and basically,</v>

41
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he educated himself,</v>

42
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

43
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 2>and it was a humble background as he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have,</v>

44
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.380
<v Speaker 2>as he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he described it himself.</v>

45
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible to educate himself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>

46
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.483
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was he just grabbing books where he </v>

47
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>was just grabbing</v>

48
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 2>books and reading them at every </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity he could get.</v>

49
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.380
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

51
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

52
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.203
<v Speaker 1>basically that's basically the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we know anything about his further </v>

53
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>education as he got a little bit older?</v>

54
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.943
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about his further </v>

55
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 2>education and I don't think he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>university educated.</v>

56
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.683
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he obviously went on to get a law </v>

57
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in those days,</v>

58
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 2>getting a law degree was you clerked </v>
<v Speaker 2>under a lawyer and then,</v>

59
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hung out your shingle,</v>

60
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

61
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

62
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as formal education is concerned,</v>

63
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have very much of that.</v>

64
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was his real ambition at first</v>

65
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.000
<v Speaker 3>to be a lawyer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

66
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether he had a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambition at first.</v>

67
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

69
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.603
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a lot of other kinds of more </v>

70
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 2>frontier oriented jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

71
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 2>That's how he got the nickname,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rail splitter.</v>

72
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on the rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those sorts of things.</v>

74
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.480
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

75
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.790
<v Speaker 2>I think he just sort of fell into a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 2>So he's alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eventually,</v>

77
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually politics became his passion.</v>

78
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a lawyer and then politics </v>

79
00:03:41.361 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>became his passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

81
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.330
<v Speaker 2>two are interrelated because remember at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that time,</v>

82
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

83
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.610
<v Speaker 2>many of your politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not most of your politicians,</v>

84
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're either came through the military </v>

85
00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:55.920
<v Speaker 2>or through the profession of law.</v>

86
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there a seminal moment for him that </v>

87
00:03:58.161 --> 00:04:02.180
<v Speaker 1>he realized this is when and why I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get into politics?</v>

88
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.383
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

89
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

90
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

91
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a life happens and </v>

92
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 2>opportunities open and you take </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage of them.</v>

93
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

94
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.071
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

96
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 2>I had a legal profession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

97
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 2>in Illinois and then he was elected to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Illinois legislature,</v>

98
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.053
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually elected to the House of </v>

99
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Representatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

100
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.630
<v Speaker 2>for a short time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and became very prominent,</v>

102
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Illinois Whig Party.</v>

103
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were his politics like in time and </v>

104
00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 1>what was the whig party like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

105
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.730
<v Speaker 1>well this is one of the places,</v>

106
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.171
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

107
00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:49.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the two parties,</v>

108
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:50.534
<v Speaker 2>ideologically at that time it was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whigs versus the Democrats and the wigs </v>

109
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.160
<v Speaker 2>or the intervention intervention is </v>
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

110
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.073
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wigs were in favor of high </v>

111
00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:02.594
<v Speaker 2>protective tariffs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were in favor of spending a lot of </v>

112
00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:08.504
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government money on internal </v>

113
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.810
<v Speaker 2>improvements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we call infrastructure today,</v>

114
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were in favor of a nationally </v>

115
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.363
<v Speaker 2>chartered bank and a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies were the outgrowth of one of </v>

116
00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:24.104
<v Speaker 2>the most prominent wig leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henry Clay and what he termed as </v>

117
00:05:26.691 --> 00:05:30.650
<v Speaker 2>American system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas by this time,</v>

118
00:05:30.651 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic Party had become the </v>
<v Speaker 2>party of a laissez faire,</v>

119
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.243
<v Speaker 2>a low tariffs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of the national bank and in </v>

120
00:05:39.681 --> 00:05:40.514
<v Speaker 2>fact actually trying to divorce </v>
<v Speaker 2>government from any relationship with </v>

121
00:05:45.441 --> 00:05:46.880
<v Speaker 2>banks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

122
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.823
<v Speaker 2>and at least trying to keep the federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>government out of funding internal </v>

123
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:53.480
<v Speaker 2>improvement.</v>

124
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

125
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.390
<v Speaker 1>that's very interesting to me because in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a modern sense,</v>

126
00:05:56.391 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be bit of a reversal on </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're at right now.</v>

127
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Lincoln really in line with.</v>

128
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

129
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 2>he really admired Henry Clay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henry Clay,</v>

130
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.210
<v Speaker 2>what was his hero?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

131
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.880
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

132
00:06:11.881 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 2>he supported all of those policies down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the line when he was in,</v>

133
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state legislature in Illinois.</v>

134
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.633
<v Speaker 2>He was crucial and passing a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive internal improvements program </v>

135
00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:31.641
<v Speaker 2>in Illinois that subsequently almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove the state into bankruptcy,</v>

136
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.550
<v Speaker 2>a financing of canals and railroads.</v>

137
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.940
<v Speaker 1>So fiscally at the time he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was spending a lot and did the,</v>

138
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.530
<v Speaker 1>the infrastructure deal actually makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

139
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

140
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

141
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.730
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

142
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if what happened is that the states went</v>

143
00:06:55.961 --> 00:06:58.690
<v Speaker 2>through sort of two phases in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure.</v>

144
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.050
<v Speaker 2>The first phase was canal building and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the second phase was railroads.</v>

145
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.960
<v Speaker 2>These are often referred to as phases of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the transportation revolution.</v>

146
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 2>During that period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

147
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.700
<v Speaker 2>the canal building or GE was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>set off by a New York building,</v>

148
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:16.534
<v Speaker 2>the Erie Canal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the few examples of a </v>

149
00:07:18.701 --> 00:07:21.280
<v Speaker 2>socialist enterprise that actually made </v>
<v Speaker 2>a profit.</v>

150
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.300
<v Speaker 2>And so this inspired a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>states to build canals,</v>

151
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:26.134
<v Speaker 2>almost all of which lost money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>created financial problems for the </v>

152
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 2>states that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

153
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

154
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.033
<v Speaker 2>built them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is suggest that they were not </v>

155
00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 2>economically justified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

156
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.380
<v Speaker 2>and then as a result of the state's </v>
<v Speaker 2>losing so much money on the canals,</v>

157
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.783
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>initially they were heavily involved in </v>

158
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:51.430
<v Speaker 2>railroads and they continue to subsidize</v>
<v Speaker 2>the railroads,</v>

159
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:52.880
<v Speaker 2>but at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.080
<v Speaker 2>by the 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 [inaudible] and 18 fifties,</v>

161
00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:56.914
<v Speaker 2>they weren't owning outright the </v>
<v Speaker 2>railroads the way they had owned </v>

162
00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:01.950
<v Speaker 2>outright the canals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And therefore,</v>

163
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

164
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.870
<v Speaker 2>even the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

165
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a little bit too much railroad</v>

166
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:10.600
<v Speaker 2>expansion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a subsidized by the government,</v>

167
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:14.590
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't as significant as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems created by the canal building.</v>

168
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is a part of Lincoln that I</v>

169
00:08:16.771 --> 00:08:17.190
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.010
<v Speaker 1>we mostly think about the civil war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>freeing the slaves,</v>

171
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.020
<v Speaker 1>but the economic party sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

172
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.943
<v Speaker 1>What do you think has sort of overriding</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic policy was because it sounds </v>

173
00:08:25.531 --> 00:08:26.364
<v Speaker 1>like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

174
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.493
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he carried this policy into the </v>

175
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 2>presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first,</v>

176
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.903
<v Speaker 2>a subsidized transcontinental railroads </v>
<v Speaker 2>were during Lincoln's administration </v>

177
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.673
<v Speaker 2>during the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that resulted in many other trans </v>

178
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:45.050
<v Speaker 2>continentals and being subsidized by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>national government and a whole bunch of</v>

179
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 2>a pork barrel legislation and in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>post civil war period,</v>

180
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:55.451
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of scandals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption involved as well.</v>

181
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

182
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

183
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 2>so his economic views continued </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout his entire career.</v>

184
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.783
<v Speaker 2>And these were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was the main dividing line between </v>

185
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 2>the two policies to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the two political parties,</v>

186
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because up until the civil war,</v>

187
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.593
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both political parties tied to straddle </v>

188
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.700
<v Speaker 2>the issue of slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they would both be national parties.</v>

189
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.053
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they tried to keep it out as best </v>

190
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 2>they could out of the political arena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did he start talking about slavery?</v>

191
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:30.991
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

192
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 2>when he was in the Illinois legislature.</v>

193
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.423
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't really start talking about </v>

194
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:36.930
<v Speaker 2>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

195
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

196
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a visceral dislike of slavery,</v>

197
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from his youth,</v>

198
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't really start talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery until,</v>

199
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the Kansas Nebraska Act.</v>

200
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.560
<v Speaker 2>And slavery becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a prominent issue and it causes a,</v>

201
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.610
<v Speaker 2>the death of the whig party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

202
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 2>and the collapse of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

203
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 2>of the wake park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you explain that a little bit more?</v>

204
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why that actually?</v>

205
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

206
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:14.090
<v Speaker 2>see both parties initially try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>straddle the slavery issue,</v>

207
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.510
<v Speaker 2>but as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it evolves over time,</v>

208
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:19.883
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whig party being more </v>

209
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:24.090
<v Speaker 2>interventionists tends to be stronger in</v>
<v Speaker 2>New England.</v>

210
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:25.783
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the Democratic Party tending to </v>

211
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:30.504
<v Speaker 2>be non intervention is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tends to be stronger in the south and </v>

212
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 2>the West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

213
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the both parties feel the strain between</v>

214
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 2>northern and southern Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>northern and southern wigs,</v>

215
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:47.181
<v Speaker 2>but the whig party is actually blown </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart by that strain after,</v>

216
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kansas Nebraska Act.</v>

217
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:55.220
<v Speaker 2>And one issue that causes the demise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whig party a is slavery.</v>

218
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 2>So you have the split between northern </v>
<v Speaker 2>whigs in southern wigs.</v>

219
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.023
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also another issue that comes </v>

220
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:08.310
<v Speaker 2>to the fore during that period is </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>

221
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

222
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nativist movement,</v>

223
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

224
00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

225
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

226
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wigs,</v>

227
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>end up embracing.</v>

228
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:22.780
<v Speaker 2>And that also is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plays a role in the,</v>

229
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.230
<v Speaker 2>in the demise of the whig party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was his policy on?</v>

230
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.583
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually Lincoln was fairly good on </v>

231
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

232
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

233
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.680
<v Speaker 2>there was a debate within the councils </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Republican Party about,</v>

234
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:35.761
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

235
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:37.900
<v Speaker 2>between those who were more nativist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

236
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.520
<v Speaker 2>those who are less nativist and Lincoln </v>
<v Speaker 2>was definitely on the side of the one he</v>

237
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:42.354
<v Speaker 2>didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want the Republican Party to </v>

238
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 2>be able to take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a platform stand on,</v>

239
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.200
<v Speaker 2>on nativism opposing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

240
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration or actually they,</v>

241
00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:54.504
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't proposing restrictions on </v>

242
00:11:56.591 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 2>immigration so much as restrictions on </v>
<v Speaker 2>acquiring citizenship.</v>

243
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.223
<v Speaker 2>So when the whig party fell apart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then basically the remnants became the </v>

244
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

245
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that like,</v>

246
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where did they literally just.</v>

247
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the people are,</v>

248
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.653
<v Speaker 2>well initially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>initially the Republican Party as a </v>

249
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 2>coalition of antislavery wigs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>antislavery Democrats.</v>

250
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.110
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

251
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:25.960
<v Speaker 2>it's exclusively a sectional party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost exclusively.</v>

252
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to be really clear on that though.</v>

253
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 2>So the Republican Party actually was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>original antislavery party.</v>

254
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 2>It was taking from both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're taking,</v>

255
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 2>now we need to be clear about this term </v>
<v Speaker 2>antislavery,</v>

256
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

257
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.100
<v Speaker 2>because being antislavery was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>

258
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.073
<v Speaker 2>a broad tent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at one extreme where the </v>

259
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 2>abolitionists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

260
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:49.853
<v Speaker 2>and at least in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the term abolitionists refers to a </v>

261
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.443
<v Speaker 2>antislavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a advocates who favor immediate </v>

262
00:12:59.081 --> 00:12:59.914
<v Speaker 2>emancipation of all slaves and full </v>
<v Speaker 2>political rights for all African </v>

263
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

264
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole range of antislavery,</v>

265
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>

266
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.270
<v Speaker 2>And so the Republican Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

267
00:13:16.271 --> 00:13:20.620
<v Speaker 2>the abolitionists are always a minority </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Republican Party,</v>

268
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:25.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm succeeds where the abolitionists </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't succeed by reducing antislavery to</v>

269
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:29.074
<v Speaker 2>its lowest common denominator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially one issue which is opposing </v>

270
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:35.320
<v Speaker 2>the spread of slavery into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>territories.</v>

271
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.670
<v Speaker 2>And so you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

272
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:42.470
<v Speaker 2>the Kansas Nebraska Act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

273
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.290
<v Speaker 2>in which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

274
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:45.280
<v Speaker 2>in which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

275
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Kansas and Nebraska were opened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery,</v>

276
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in violation of the Missouri compromise </v>

277
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:58.861
<v Speaker 2>is what sort of inspires this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a concern among antislavery northerners.</v>

278
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 2>So just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to be clear,</v>

279
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:07.411
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of Democrats involved in</v>

280
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 2>former Democrats involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican Party.</v>

281
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln's secretary of State Solomon </v>
<v Speaker 2>chases a former Democrat,</v>

282
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>several Republican governors,</v>

283
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and send it,</v>

284
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:20.820
<v Speaker 2>pardon me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>

285
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Republican senators and governors are </v>
<v Speaker 2>former Republican.</v>

286
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:25.403
<v Speaker 2>So in Lincoln's election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Republican party has to sort of </v>

287
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:35.791
<v Speaker 2>straddle these economic issues to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides of the coalition Together.</v>

288
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Where did he fall when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was running for president,</v>

289
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.620
<v Speaker 2>where did he fall on that scale of </v>
<v Speaker 2>abolitionists?</v>

290
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.960
<v Speaker 2>To what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call you?</v>

291
00:14:46.961 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 2>Call that other group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were sort of,</v>

292
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:49.131
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just a,</v>

293
00:14:49.131 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 2>they're just anti slavery and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

294
00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that approach that they had,</v>

295
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:54.310
<v Speaker 2>what would you refer to?</v>

296
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Is that pragmatic or what did they base?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a.</v>

297
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gradualist pragmatic.</v>

298
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

299
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 2>this is where Lincoln follows Henry </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clay.</v>

300
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.063
<v Speaker 2>Henry clay was a favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W W was in favor of colonization in </v>

301
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:13.410
<v Speaker 2>other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

302
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.790
<v Speaker 2>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

303
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.673
<v Speaker 2>having a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plan of perhaps compensated </v>

304
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 2>emancipation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

305
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:21.390
<v Speaker 2>in which freed slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

306
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.490
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

307
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.373
<v Speaker 2>move to back to Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Lincoln was a big advocate of </v>

308
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:30.620
<v Speaker 2>colonization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

309
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:34.580
<v Speaker 2>he continues to pursue colonization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

310
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.000
<v Speaker 2>even after the outbreak of the civil </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

311
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the end of the civil war,</v>

312
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 2>he's probably given up on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but during the civil war,</v>

313
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

314
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsored one,</v>

315
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.370
<v Speaker 2>a disastrous attempt at colonization in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Haiti,</v>

316
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

317
00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:55.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't work.</v>

318
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.750
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

319
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.580
<v Speaker 2>what happened is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

320
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Speaker 2>they got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

321
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bit hazy on the details </v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

322
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.950
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some land was acquired in Haiti and they</v>

323
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:07.784
<v Speaker 2>got some African Americans who agreed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>move there and then it was not just </v>

324
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:14.870
<v Speaker 2>economically unviable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

325
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does had problems with disease.</v>

326
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.170
<v Speaker 2>And so the whole colony collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

327
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.110
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

328
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:29.140
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to push it in Latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something similar to Liberia.</v>

329
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Africa,</v>

330
00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:36.074
<v Speaker 2>which also was also a colonization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skiing a set up by the American </v>

331
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Colonization Society of which Henry Clay</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a participant.</v>

332
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:46.423
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a couple of interesting </v>

333
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:48.284
<v Speaker 2>things there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you referenced that the Whig Party </v>

334
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:49.964
<v Speaker 2>itself had a sort of internal conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>between their northern representatives </v>

335
00:16:53.731 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 2>and that would be someone like Abraham </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln had their southern.</v>

336
00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 2>If you are a local representative in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>legislature in Illinois,</v>

337
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 2>did it ever come up to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

338
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:04.274
<v Speaker 2>why would slavery even really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was only within the national </v>

339
00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:07.131
<v Speaker 2>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

340
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:07.964
<v Speaker 2>Like was it something that people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually voting on in any way or not at </v>

341
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:11.570
<v Speaker 2>the state level?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

342
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Th,</v>

343
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:14.703
<v Speaker 2>they're hard to think of party politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>into 2018 lens without everything being </v>

344
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.470
<v Speaker 2>a national and everybody affected by </v>
<v Speaker 2>every little thing.</v>

345
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

346
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:23.084
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only sense in which it was it the </v>

347
00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:26.744
<v Speaker 2>only sense in which the state you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved at the state level was with </v>

348
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:31.034
<v Speaker 2>respect to the fugitive slave law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the history of </v>

349
00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:36.530
<v Speaker 2>slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always this tension between free</v>

350
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:38.590
<v Speaker 2>states and slave states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

351
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.080
<v Speaker 2>even at the constitutional convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

352
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.420
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

353
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.820
<v Speaker 2>is usually kept below the surface except</v>
<v Speaker 2>during,</v>

354
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

355
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instances where it,</v>

356
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.843
<v Speaker 2>where it erupts and then it's resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you first have a Missouri coming in </v>

357
00:17:58.561 --> 00:17:59.394
<v Speaker 2>as a slave state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which leads to the Missouri compromise </v>

358
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:02.620
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

359
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.630
<v Speaker 2>things calmed down and then you have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tariff issue,</v>

360
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Speaker 2>which is partially driven by South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Carolina slave.</v>

361
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.653
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have a things calming down </v>

362
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:19.971
<v Speaker 2>with the annexation of Texas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>California coming in as a state.</v>

363
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Slavery becomes a big issue again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

364
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 2>and it's partially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

365
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

366
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm calmed down by the compromise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>1850 and then after that you'll have the</v>

367
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Kansas Nebraska act.</v>

368
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.080
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

369
00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:37.914
<v Speaker 2>then there's no calming it down anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the compromise of 1850 is </v>

370
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:44.820
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the,</v>

371
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:45.743
<v Speaker 2>part of what southerners got out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromise of 1850 or more precisely </v>

372
00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:53.490
<v Speaker 2>slaveholders was the slave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the fugitive slave act of 1850.</v>

373
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm now one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the constitutional deals,</v>

374
00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the constitution,</v>

375
00:18:59.821 --> 00:19:03.090
<v Speaker 2>there's a fugitive slave provision in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

376
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.203
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the obligation of free states to </v>

377
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:07.704
<v Speaker 2>return runaway slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And The Washington administration </v>

378
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:12.840
<v Speaker 2>actually passed the first fugitive slave</v>
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>

379
00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:13.674
<v Speaker 2>But the fugitive slave act of 1850 was </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most draconian laws that </v>

380
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Congress ever enacted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

381
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

382
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:25.510
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it set up a,</v>

383
00:19:25.511 --> 00:19:28.620
<v Speaker 2>a bureaucracy of commissioners who would</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear,</v>

384
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

385
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 2>cases of fugitive slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got $5 if they decided that,</v>

386
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

387
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person wasn't a slave and $10,</v>

388
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:42.830
<v Speaker 2>if they decided it was a sleigh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

389
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

390
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.650
<v Speaker 2>the slave had no right to represent j </v>
<v Speaker 2>station.</v>

391
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm a jury trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No right to testify.</v>

392
00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:53.660
<v Speaker 2>The legislature and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

393
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.090
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

394
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.210
<v Speaker 2>the commissioners could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

395
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

396
00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:03.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>require the cooperation of individuals,</v>

397
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

398
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.233
<v Speaker 2>to apprehend runaways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you violated a that you could </v>

399
00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:15.330
<v Speaker 2>face a jail sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$1,000</v>

400
00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:17.550
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a $1,000</v>

401
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:20.670
<v Speaker 2>civil penalties for each escaped slave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was pretty.</v>

402
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:25.440
<v Speaker 2>So many of your northern states began </v>
<v Speaker 2>before this,</v>

403
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:29.280
<v Speaker 2>but began after this passing what were </v>
<v Speaker 2>called personal liberty laws.</v>

404
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.793
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make sure that state </v>
<v Speaker 2>officials did not participate in the </v>

405
00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:40.280
<v Speaker 2>apprehension and return of runaways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

406
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.250
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

407
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.250
<v Speaker 2>that's the big slavery issue in northern</v>
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>

408
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like such a crazy thing </v>

409
00:20:45.961 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 2>because they were incentivizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>northern states that may not have wanted</v>

410
00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:50.464
<v Speaker 2>to send the slaves back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were literally financially </v>

411
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:54.700
<v Speaker 2>incentivizing and then as you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

412
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.090
<v Speaker 2>there were other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were just citizens that were going</v>

413
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:58.924
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also also also made it easier to </v>

414
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 2>engage in kidnapping.</v>

415
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm free blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

416
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 2>bringing them south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was fighting this the most?</v>

417
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:09.874
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine there must've been some </v>

418
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:13.390
<v Speaker 2>states rights people in the north that </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you didn't even care about slavery</v>

419
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:14.224
<v Speaker 2>per se,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but must've said you can't tell what </v>

420
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.013
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things after the </v>

421
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:23.821
<v Speaker 2>compromise of 1850 that brings slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts pushing it to the forefront.</v>

422
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.450
<v Speaker 2>And of course this is when a heli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elliot,</v>

423
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.710
<v Speaker 2>a uncle Tom's cabin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

424
00:21:32.711 --> 00:21:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Henry beat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's her first name?</v>

425
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.823
<v Speaker 2>I'm drawing a blank up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll pop up and say I'm a Harriet </v>

426
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Beecher stowe rights uncle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom's cabin,</v>

427
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.850
<v Speaker 2>which becomes a best seller and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the fugitive slave issues.</v>

428
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.280
<v Speaker 2>So it sensitizes a lot of northerners to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fugitive slave a question.</v>

429
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.013
<v Speaker 2>And so a Illinois doesn't pass it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal liberty law because southern </v>

430
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:05.431
<v Speaker 2>Illinois is actually settled by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

431
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the southern,</v>

432
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eastern southern states,</v>

433
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:11.483
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of your other states like </v>

434
00:22:13.661 --> 00:22:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

435
00:22:15.461 --> 00:22:16.294
<v Speaker 2>and states further north do pass </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal liberty laws as a result of </v>

436
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 2>either before the fugitive slave act or </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the fugitive slave act.</v>

437
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 2>So before we get directly into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidency and the war,</v>

438
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:29.224
<v Speaker 2>is there anything else we need to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Lincoln's politics at the time or </v>

439
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:32.584
<v Speaker 2>what else was influencing him besides </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously there were states' rights </v>

440
00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:38.410
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was obviously the slavery issue.</v>

441
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.041
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

442
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:39.874
<v Speaker 2>was there anything else that we think of</v>
<v Speaker 2>as really the moments that kind of </v>

443
00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:44.480
<v Speaker 2>shaped him before the president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

444
00:22:44.481 --> 00:22:45.314
<v Speaker 2>I think we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've covered the important </v>

445
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:47.500
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the big ones.</v>

446
00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he runs for president.</v>

447
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.760
<v Speaker 2>What do we need to know about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform?</v>

448
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>

449
00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 2>it tries to paper over the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between former Democrats informer wigs.</v>

450
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 2>It has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a plank about,</v>

451
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

452
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.660
<v Speaker 2>about the tariff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

453
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:09.800
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

454
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.490
<v Speaker 2>can be interpreted differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

455
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:18.300
<v Speaker 2>but the primary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plank is a,</v>

456
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.240
<v Speaker 2>his opposition to the spread of slavery </v>
<v Speaker 2>into any more territories.</v>

457
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

458
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.363
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting about that plank is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's essentially that plank has </v>

459
00:23:34.241 --> 00:23:38.980
<v Speaker 2>essentially been declared </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in</v>

460
00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:42.070
<v Speaker 2>the dred Scott decision in the dred </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott decision.</v>

461
00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:45.910
<v Speaker 2>The Supreme Court says that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

462
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:47.700
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

463
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.840
<v Speaker 2>the territories are the common property </v>
<v Speaker 2>of both nor northerners and southerners,</v>

464
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.223
<v Speaker 2>and therefore the national government </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot restrict the property rights of </v>

465
00:23:58.071 --> 00:23:58.904
<v Speaker 2>southerners when they move into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>territories by preventing them from </v>

466
00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:05.130
<v Speaker 2>bringing their slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

467
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.500
<v Speaker 1>so you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a platform plank that was,</v>

468
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.620
<v Speaker 1>that was literally unconstitutional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a declared unconstitutional.</v>

469
00:24:12.621 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most Supreme Court,</v>

470
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.283
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

471
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.790
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

472
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.640
<v Speaker 1>legal scholars today think it was a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad decision,</v>

473
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:20.560
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

474
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:21.463
<v Speaker 1>had been declared unconstitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we need to know about the tenor </v>

475
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.100
<v Speaker 1>of the political infighting at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

476
00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:28.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days,</v>

477
00:24:28.761 --> 00:24:30.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone always says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never has never been worse.</v>

478
00:24:30.831 --> 00:24:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's meaner than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

479
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.630
<v Speaker 1>trump's tweeting this and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

480
00:24:35.631 --> 00:24:38.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some pretty serious fighting.</v>

481
00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

482
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.460
<v Speaker 2>And those kinds of claims or are </v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggerated,</v>

483
00:24:42.461 --> 00:24:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

484
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:48.740
<v Speaker 2>you can find a campaign rhetoric and </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign literature that,</v>

485
00:24:50.771 --> 00:24:51.604
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not vicious version of verges on </v>

486
00:24:53.261 --> 00:24:58.261
<v Speaker 2>being vicious throughout this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the period leading up to the civil war.</v>

487
00:24:58.301 --> 00:25:00.810
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

488
00:25:00.811 --> 00:25:05.811
<v Speaker 2>are the 1860 election is particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unique in that respect.</v>

489
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.613
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what happens is that you end up </v>

490
00:25:09.281 --> 00:25:10.114
<v Speaker 2>having a four candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Lincoln as the candidate of the </v>

491
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Republican Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

492
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.813
<v Speaker 2>and then the Democratic Party splits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have Stephen Douglas as the </v>

493
00:25:23.111 --> 00:25:23.944
<v Speaker 2>candidate of the northern Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm John Breckinridge is the candidate </v>

494
00:25:28.421 --> 00:25:29.870
<v Speaker 2>of the southern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

495
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some of your,</v>

496
00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

497
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.800
<v Speaker 2>upper tiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>former southern wigs,</v>

498
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>form a constitutional union party.</v>

499
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.313
<v Speaker 2>So to oversimplify only a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes really to elections and </v>

500
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:51.303
<v Speaker 2>election between Lincoln and Douglas in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the north and in an election between </v>

501
00:25:53.981 --> 00:25:57.610
<v Speaker 2>Breckenridge and John Bell and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Constitutional Union Party in the south.</v>

502
00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next obvious segue is the Lincoln</v>

503
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Debates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

504
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.871
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

505
00:26:02.871 --> 00:26:04.730
<v Speaker 1>that's before the 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 election.</v>

506
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.080
<v Speaker 1>It was for that election though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

507
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

508
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.570
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

509
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.153
<v Speaker 1>remember this,</v>

510
00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm,</v>

511
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.010
<v Speaker 2>senators are still chosen by the state </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislature.</v>

512
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one of the things that makes a</v>

513
00:26:18.461 --> 00:26:23.461
<v Speaker 2>debate unique because it's the 1858 </v>
<v Speaker 2>Senate election in Illinois.</v>

514
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.570
<v Speaker 2>The legislature is going to choose who </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to be the senator,</v>

515
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.640
<v Speaker 2>but the Republican candidate is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is Lincoln,</v>

516
00:26:33.641 --> 00:26:34.474
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic candidate is douglas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they go around and have these </v>

517
00:26:40.451 --> 00:26:42.060
<v Speaker 2>debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

518
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:47.450
<v Speaker 2>at various throughout Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>

519
00:26:47.451 --> 00:26:48.284
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to think that I know a lot about </v>

520
00:26:49.191 --> 00:26:50.270
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea that,</v>

521
00:26:50.271 --> 00:26:51.104
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't on the national scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they did run against each other </v>

522
00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:55.160
<v Speaker 2>just two years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years later.</v>

523
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.003
<v Speaker 2>So this actually propels Lincoln into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the forefront of potential candidates </v>

524
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.083
<v Speaker 2>for the Republican nomination in 1860,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the legislature chooses </v>

525
00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:08.484
<v Speaker 2>douglass as an Illinois senator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I want you to explain what the </v>

526
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln Douglas debates are and why </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's such a richness there,</v>

527
00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:21.500
<v Speaker 2>but was nothing like this even done </v>
<v Speaker 2>before that when we,</v>

528
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.170
<v Speaker 2>everyone talks about it like it was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary or we so desperately could</v>

529
00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 2>use it these days.</v>

530
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.903
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go so far as say it nothing </v>

531
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:33.291
<v Speaker 2>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of how extensive it was and</v>

532
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.570
<v Speaker 2>the draw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was unprecedented.</v>

533
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.023
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you explain the basic tenants of </v>

534
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.570
<v Speaker 2>sort of how it would work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

535
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.433
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically they picked out various </v>

536
00:27:47.091 --> 00:27:47.924
<v Speaker 2>locations in Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the number of debates and they </v>

537
00:27:51.141 --> 00:27:53.560
<v Speaker 2>would travel there and then they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

538
00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:59.010
<v Speaker 2>a face off each other and the big issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>with slavery and Lincoln,</v>

539
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.913
<v Speaker 2>his position was prohibiting slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The extension of slavery into the </v>

540
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.000
<v Speaker 2>territory's Douglass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his position he was trying,</v>

541
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.300
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic Party hadn't split,</v>

542
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:17.230
<v Speaker 2>so he was trying to maintain the unity </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Democratic Party.</v>

543
00:28:19.221 --> 00:28:20.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

544
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:26.060
<v Speaker 2>his position is known as popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty and his view was that,</v>

545
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

546
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.233
<v Speaker 2>we leave the territory's open and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>let people in the territory's decide </v>

547
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.640
<v Speaker 2>whether it's going to be a slave </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory or a free territory,</v>

548
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:42.523
<v Speaker 2>but that creates a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambiguity because when did I get to </v>

549
00:28:46.341 --> 00:28:47.174
<v Speaker 2>decide?</v>

550
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Do they only get to the side?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

551
00:28:51.111 --> 00:28:56.111
<v Speaker 2>at the time of statehood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also a,</v>

552
00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they decide before statehood,</v>

553
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.500
<v Speaker 2>aren't they violating the dred Scott </v>
<v Speaker 2>Decision?</v>

554
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was,</v>

555
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.960
<v Speaker 2>but there was also a racial element to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the debates.</v>

556
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you brought,</v>

557
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.500
<v Speaker 2>you brought up the issue of viciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the campaigns.</v>

558
00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:16.683
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attempt is to paint Lincoln as an </v>

559
00:29:21.111 --> 00:29:22.820
<v Speaker 2>advocate of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

560
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.740
<v Speaker 2>racial amalgamation because even in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>north,</v>

561
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:28.973
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the northern states being free </v>

562
00:29:30.981 --> 00:29:32.840
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

563
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.760
<v Speaker 2>in most of the northern states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>African Americans face legal disability,</v>

564
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:39.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

565
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.510
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and significant social discrimination.</v>

566
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.943
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

567
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 2>so at this time a Lincoln would make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction between,</v>

568
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:53.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between a civil equality,</v>

569
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.153
<v Speaker 2>political equality and social equality </v>
<v Speaker 2>and civil equality is being means being </v>

570
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:01.390
<v Speaker 2>equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before the law,</v>

571
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.613
<v Speaker 2>political equality would involve giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>African Americans the right to vote and </v>

572
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:08.920
<v Speaker 2>then we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social equality is about.</v>

573
00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:09.754
<v Speaker 2>So his position at this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did not advocate political equality </v>

574
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.600
<v Speaker 2>was not in favor of giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>African-americans.</v>

575
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

576
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:24.180
<v Speaker 2>but he was firmly in favor of civil </v>
<v Speaker 2>equality and that's where he and Douglas</v>

577
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that</v>

578
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:28.223
<v Speaker 1>part?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally pragmatic in that he felt if he </v>

579
00:30:30.961 --> 00:30:31.501
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

580
00:30:31.501 --> 00:30:32.334
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

581
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.750
<v Speaker 2>it might have been programmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but remember he,</v>

582
00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:35.390
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

583
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.950
<v Speaker 2>as I said he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in favor of colonization,</v>

584
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

585
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:44.890
<v Speaker 2>even if he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when he began to entertain views of</v>

586
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:49.480
<v Speaker 2>political equality for pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>

587
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:52.750
<v Speaker 2>not politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for pragmatic reasons.</v>

588
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:55.460
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't sure if the country was ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

589
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.800
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would use arguments which I think are</v>

590
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:01.120
<v Speaker 2>sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

591
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

592
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.383
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

593
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

594
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.953
<v Speaker 2>that the two races are not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable living together and that it </v>

595
00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:13.201
<v Speaker 2>would be better off for African </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans once free to,</v>

596
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move elsewhere.</v>

597
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he,</v>

598
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.503
<v Speaker 2>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he eventually dropped that and </v>

599
00:31:18.011 --> 00:31:23.011
<v Speaker 2>eventually by the end of his life was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>favoring a limited franchise for a freed</v>

600
00:31:25.241 --> 00:31:29.470
<v Speaker 2>African Americans in Louisiana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his ideas are changing.</v>

601
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:30.310
<v Speaker 2>They're progressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

602
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's interesting is that there </v>

603
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:32.944
<v Speaker 1>is an evolution here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really we find out really in the </v>

604
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:37.540
<v Speaker 1>presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did the abolitionists basically hate him</v>

605
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:38.291
<v Speaker 1>at that point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

606
00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:42.610
<v Speaker 1>did they think he was sort of a sellout </v>
<v Speaker 1>or that he just because he was doing the</v>

607
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:43.900
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

608
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.270
<v Speaker 2>abolitionists did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some abolitionists did ever.</v>

609
00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

610
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

611
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:52.403
<v Speaker 2>so there was still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there had been before the creation of </v>

612
00:31:55.441 --> 00:31:56.274
<v Speaker 2>the Republican party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there had been the liberty party in the </v>

613
00:31:57.991 --> 00:31:58.824
<v Speaker 2>free soil party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were slightly broader antislavery </v>

614
00:32:01.351 --> 00:32:02.184
<v Speaker 2>coalitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but minor minor parties and there still </v>

615
00:32:05.311 --> 00:32:08.550
<v Speaker 2>was a radical abolitionist party that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ran in 1860,</v>

616
00:32:08.551 --> 00:32:10.650
<v Speaker 2>but it garnered very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

617
00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.750
<v Speaker 2>a few votes</v>

618
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.970
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

619
00:32:13.971 --> 00:32:16.700
<v Speaker 1>So we started touching them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginnings of the election.</v>

620
00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:18.630
<v Speaker 1>So basically for candidates running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

621
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:20.810
<v Speaker 1>because of the split in the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Party.</v>

622
00:32:20.811 --> 00:32:23.330
<v Speaker 1>What else do we have to know before he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets elected that,</v>

623
00:32:23.331 --> 00:32:23.810
<v Speaker 1>that happened?</v>

624
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.160
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

625
00:32:25.161 --> 00:32:25.994
<v Speaker 2>he didn't win the popular vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even if you combine the vote of all </v>

626
00:32:29.571 --> 00:32:30.404
<v Speaker 2>the other candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he still would have won the electoral </v>

627
00:32:32.181 --> 00:32:33.150
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

628
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.133
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was the beginning of his </v>

629
00:32:35.371 --> 00:32:36.570
<v Speaker 1>presidency?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

630
00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

631
00:32:37.701 --> 00:32:38.534
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of his is a dominated by </v>

632
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a succession of the deep south.</v>

633
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.190
<v Speaker 2>So soon after he was inaugurated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

634
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.370
<v Speaker 2>well after he's elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

635
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.520
<v Speaker 2>the deep south secedes with South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Carolina being the first state,</v>

636
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:04.060
<v Speaker 2>and then you have the cotton states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm succeeding was even inaugurated now.</v>

637
00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.093
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was right after the election is </v>

638
00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:11.270
<v Speaker 2>incredible by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One interesting detail that,</v>

639
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are unaware of and South</v>

640
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:17.300
<v Speaker 2>Carolina's ordinance of succession and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the first state.</v>

641
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:20.220
<v Speaker 2>They're the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the most firebrand of all the,</v>

642
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.910
<v Speaker 2>a secessionist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

643
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their ordinance of secession.</v>

644
00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do not,</v>

645
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

646
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:29.913
<v Speaker 2>the issue they give the largest play too</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of justifying secession is not </v>

647
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:35.444
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln's election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but northern failure to comply with the </v>

648
00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:41.270
<v Speaker 2>fugitive slave clause of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

649
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.673
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partially that's a rhetorical ploy </v>

650
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:46.700
<v Speaker 2>because it allows them to argue that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>northerners,</v>

651
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.903
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ha ha had divided the constitutional </v>

652
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:51.254
<v Speaker 2>contract first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also reflects a deep concern </v>

653
00:33:54.861 --> 00:33:57.980
<v Speaker 2>about I'm a fugitive slaves.</v>

654
00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.900
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the,</v>

655
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.913
<v Speaker 2>one of the points that I make in my book</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I think most historians have </v>

656
00:34:05.241 --> 00:34:07.990
<v Speaker 2>underestimated the economic significance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

657
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.560
<v Speaker 2>of the fugitive slave issue in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing on succession.</v>

658
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.740
<v Speaker 2>And maybe we can get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

659
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.130
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do want to get to that.</v>

660
00:34:16.131 --> 00:34:17.000
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

661
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.863
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have the deep south seceding and </v>

662
00:34:19.521 --> 00:34:20.354
<v Speaker 2>they're seizing all of the US military </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis except for a few that are holding </v>

663
00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:26.714
<v Speaker 2>out and the prominent one that's holding</v>
<v Speaker 2>out his fort sumpter and Charleston </v>

664
00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:31.640
<v Speaker 2>harbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

665
00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:36.230
<v Speaker 2>so James Buchanan has to deal with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the lame duck president.</v>

666
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.920
<v Speaker 2>He tries to reinforce a sumpter and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>South Carolina fires on the ship.</v>

667
00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:44.744
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the garrison is still there when </v>

668
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes president.</v>

669
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.903
<v Speaker 2>So that's the big issue that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominating a Lincoln's presidency is </v>

670
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:54.980
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do about Fort Sumpter?</v>

671
00:34:55.730 --> 00:35:00.730
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

672
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's getting all kinds of advice.</v>

673
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people want him to try to.</v>

674
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:14.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm back down on the Republican position</v>
<v Speaker 2>about slavery in the territories,</v>

675
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.130
<v Speaker 2>but he absolutely refuses to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

676
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:19.964
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has agreed to enforce the fugitive </v>

677
00:35:22.191 --> 00:35:23.024
<v Speaker 2>slave act as president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is the only antislavery issue </v>

678
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.700
<v Speaker 2>and he decides to hang onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

679
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.980
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

680
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:35.810
<v Speaker 2>a more aggressive policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone the more passive policy,</v>

681
00:35:35.811 --> 00:35:40.811
<v Speaker 2>basically I'm Lincoln essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>follows Buchanan's policy,</v>

682
00:35:42.751 --> 00:35:43.584
<v Speaker 2>although Buchanan gets a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism you that and what happens is </v>

683
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.430
<v Speaker 2>we'll Buchanan's policy being what being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

684
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:58.460
<v Speaker 2>trying to reinforce the fort but not </v>
<v Speaker 2>using military force to,</v>

685
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

686
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.310
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

687
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.380
<v Speaker 2>hold on to the fort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

688
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

689
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:06.923
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln sends 'em reinforcements and </v>

690
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:14.160
<v Speaker 2>supplies to the Fort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

691
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling the uh,</v>

692
00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 2>South Carolina that he's doing.</v>

693
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.640
<v Speaker 2>So by this time the confederacy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>formed,</v>

694
00:36:19.641 --> 00:36:22.530
<v Speaker 2>the confederacy fires on Fort Sumpter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

695
00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:24.410
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the,</v>

696
00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.550
<v Speaker 2>that's the nine slash 11 of the civil </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

697
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:27.563
<v Speaker 2>It polarizes both sides of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Polarizes northerners because up until </v>

698
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:35.184
<v Speaker 2>this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of northern resou </v>

699
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:36.451
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

700
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 2>we should let the south going piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of them think,</v>

701
00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:39.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we let them go and piece,</v>

702
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:41.980
<v Speaker 2>they'll come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

703
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.580
<v Speaker 2>and at the time of Lincoln's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inauguration,</v>

704
00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 2>there's still more slave states in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>union then out of the union.</v>

705
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Lincoln responds to the firing on </v>

706
00:36:52.081 --> 00:36:57.081
<v Speaker 2>Fort Sumpter by calling out troops and </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately Virginia,</v>

707
00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:58.763
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee and Arkansas all joined the </v>

708
00:37:03.241 --> 00:37:04.450
<v Speaker 2>confederacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

709
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.453
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

710
00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.410
<v Speaker 2>it's the great divide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

711
00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.770
<v Speaker 2>with a stroke of the pen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

712
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.340
<v Speaker 2>he's doubled the size and the material </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources of the confederacy.</v>

713
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:15.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we know about his thought </v>

714
00:37:16.081 --> 00:37:17.070
<v Speaker 2>process at the time?</v>

715
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really ready for the fallout that was</v>

716
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:22.740
<v Speaker 2>gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

717
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.450
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the escalation.</v>

718
00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.653
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me back up a little and explain why </v>

719
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:31.300
<v Speaker 2>he had to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

720
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.173
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it was politically necessary to do </v>

721
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:34.630
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

722
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:39.330
<v Speaker 2>many of your abolitionists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly William Lloyd Garrison,</v>

723
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:44.331
<v Speaker 2>who is one of my heroes who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>advocated immediate emancipation,</v>

724
00:37:44.401 --> 00:37:46.860
<v Speaker 2>full political rights for all African </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>

725
00:37:46.861 --> 00:37:51.230
<v Speaker 2>He was also a pacifist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an anarchist,</v>

726
00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.120
<v Speaker 2>a classical liberal and favor of free </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade,</v>

727
00:37:54.121 --> 00:37:58.830
<v Speaker 2>free labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his opposition to slavery.</v>

728
00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:03.831
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the radical abolitionist framed</v>
<v Speaker 2>it as man stealing.</v>

729
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

730
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of a property rights and he was</v>

731
00:38:08.011 --> 00:38:08.844
<v Speaker 2>also in favor of northern secession from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the union because he saw the </v>

732
00:38:12.961 --> 00:38:16.470
<v Speaker 2>constitution as a pro slavery document.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

733
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.650
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

734
00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.290
<v Speaker 2>denounced the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

735
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:20.363
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a publicly burned a copy and on the </v>

736
00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:26.604
<v Speaker 2>masthead of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his paper that liberate or no union </v>

737
00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:30.880
<v Speaker 2>with slave holders.</v>

738
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm grace throughout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

739
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 2>from 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>31 on to the civil war.</v>

740
00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:37.183
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was true of many of your most </v>

741
00:38:38.951 --> 00:38:39.784
<v Speaker 2>radical abolitionists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically what you're abolitionists </v>

742
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:46.543
<v Speaker 2>and one of the reasons they were so </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpopular is because they were saying </v>

743
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:53.350
<v Speaker 2>you can't have antislavery and union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

744
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

745
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.900
<v Speaker 2>people are committed to the union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

746
00:38:58.901 --> 00:39:00.970
<v Speaker 2>So they're not happy about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Appalachian.</v>

747
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:06.360
<v Speaker 2>The Republican Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by reducing the antislavery issue to its</v>

748
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:10.930
<v Speaker 2>lowest common denominator in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory's is telling the public,</v>

749
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:15.330
<v Speaker 2>you can have a antislavery in union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

750
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the unions threatened,</v>

751
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:18.663
<v Speaker 2>the Republican Party is going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>suppress succession or face political </v>

752
00:39:23.201 --> 00:39:25.120
<v Speaker 2>oblivion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

753
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.350
<v Speaker 2>even if Stephen Douglas had been elected</v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

754
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:35.190
<v Speaker 2>he's an old hard line Jacksonian if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had been elected president and the south</v>

755
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 2>had still succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's not very likely,</v>

756
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.370
<v Speaker 2>but if he had been elected president and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the staff,</v>

757
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:41.263
<v Speaker 2>it's succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably would have moved a military </v>

758
00:39:44.651 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 2>force against the south even faster than</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln</v>

759
00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:47.923
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

760
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:48.913
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting because I think one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the themes as we do this whole week </v>

761
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.223
<v Speaker 1>is looking at these people through 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 1>lens and when you hear that somebody </v>

762
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:58.383
<v Speaker 1>didn't want full rights for people but </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to free them or they couldn't </v>

763
00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.890
<v Speaker 1>vote or some of the other issues you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

764
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.993
<v Speaker 1>And yet at the same time you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the abolition is actually weren't </v>

765
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:07.110
<v Speaker 1>that popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

766
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.373
<v Speaker 1>It's like to give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to view these people through our lens </v>

767
00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 1>today is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really,</v>

768
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:13.623
<v Speaker 1>it's a very slippery slope because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln had to do some things that </v>

769
00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.420
<v Speaker 1>perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

770
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:23.810
<v Speaker 1>in our lens now would have been viewed </v>
<v Speaker 1>as very unfair to the African American.</v>

771
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.570
<v Speaker 1>And there he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

772
00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

773
00:40:26.451 --> 00:40:30.380
<v Speaker 1>the war begins and he said he's a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>president at war.</v>

774
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is he getting advice from?</v>

775
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he really understand how to.</v>

776
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:36.743
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

777
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:37.763
<v Speaker 2>the other part of the answer to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>question is that I'm a Lincoln and many </v>

778
00:40:44.611 --> 00:40:49.611
<v Speaker 2>of the Republicans in many northerners </v>
<v Speaker 2>in general underestimated,</v>

779
00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:51.613
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enthusiasm for succession on the </v>

780
00:40:55.141 --> 00:40:58.440
<v Speaker 2>part of southerners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believed,</v>

781
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.560
<v Speaker 2>initially believed that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>southern elite of slaveholders,</v>

782
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.910
<v Speaker 2>almost a conspiracy that had brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>about succession and that,</v>

783
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:14.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why they weren't prepared for</v>

784
00:41:15.001 --> 00:41:19.710
<v Speaker 2>the extent of the resistance of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>southerners.</v>

785
00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once Lincoln,</v>

786
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:24.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls out troops.</v>

787
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:29.760
<v Speaker 2>And so once he calls out troops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

788
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.920
<v Speaker 2>then you have the problem of managing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the war.</v>

789
00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 1>So there was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could have done at</v>

790
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.080
<v Speaker 2>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if even if there were voices,</v>

791
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.200
<v Speaker 2>even if he internally felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

792
00:41:38.201 --> 00:41:41.570
<v Speaker 2>maybe we could just let them go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if he had voices around him that were</v>

793
00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:42.170
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

794
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seed,</v>

795
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.260
<v Speaker 2>it was too late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

796
00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:45.990
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

797
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically.</v>

798
00:41:48.001 --> 00:41:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by that time I'm in the north,</v>

799
00:41:51.631 --> 00:41:52.464
<v Speaker 2>at least not in the deep south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the North Liberty in union had </v>

800
00:41:56.971 --> 00:42:01.080
<v Speaker 2>become mystically identify as </v>
<v Speaker 2>inseparable.</v>

801
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

802
00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:07.770
<v Speaker 2>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

803
00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.180
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

804
00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:12.000
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this leads to the question of,</v>

805
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:12.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

806
00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.930
<v Speaker 2>a more basic question of what caused the</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil war.</v>

807
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's now a current trend to argue</v>

808
00:42:21.001 --> 00:42:24.780
<v Speaker 2>that slavery caused the civil war and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that caused the civil war,</v>

809
00:42:24.781 --> 00:42:27.390
<v Speaker 2>but it was all about slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

810
00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.450
<v Speaker 2>and that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery,</v>

811
00:42:29.451 --> 00:42:32.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire history of the union up until</v>

812
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.080
<v Speaker 2>that point is all about slavery.</v>

813
00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.070
<v Speaker 2>You disagree with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just get away.</v>

814
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that asking what caused the </v>
<v Speaker 2>civil war is the wrong question.</v>

815
00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:48.020
<v Speaker 2>And even some of your new abolitionists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>historians like Ken Stamp and Eric Foner</v>

816
00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.680
<v Speaker 2>have pointed out that they're really two</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate questions.</v>

817
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Why does the sow seed and why does the </v>
<v Speaker 2>North refused to let the south go?</v>

818
00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:02.460
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to the first question is </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely slavery.</v>

819
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence is overwhelming for that.</v>

820
00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:05.603
<v Speaker 2>There's probably hardly any historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>causal explanation at that level of </v>

821
00:43:10.891 --> 00:43:14.760
<v Speaker 2>abstraction for which the evidence is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more overwhelming.</v>

822
00:43:14.761 --> 00:43:17.010
<v Speaker 2>So the south secedes in order to protect</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery.</v>

823
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's easy,</v>

824
00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:22.110
<v Speaker 2>but I'm ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slavery is not what motivates the north,</v>

825
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.720
<v Speaker 2>what motivates the north is preserving </v>
<v Speaker 2>the union.</v>

826
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.220
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln,</v>

827
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

828
00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:29.283
<v Speaker 2>in the Er before the firing on Fort </v>
<v Speaker 2>sumpter endorses a original 13th </v>

829
00:43:35.401 --> 00:43:36.234
<v Speaker 2>amendment which has not passed in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still holding to the position of </v>

830
00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:43.500
<v Speaker 2>opposing the extension of slavery in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>territories.</v>

831
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.730
<v Speaker 2>But this new amendment would protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery in the existing slave states and</v>

832
00:43:47.731 --> 00:43:52.731
<v Speaker 2>be unamendable in the early days of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

833
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:54.923
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of your union commanders were </v>

834
00:43:57.151 --> 00:44:00.210
<v Speaker 2>returning runaway slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

835
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

836
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.750
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the war from the union perspective,</v>

837
00:44:04.751 --> 00:44:08.070
<v Speaker 2>the suppression of succession is </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to preserve the union.</v>

838
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.293
<v Speaker 2>And Lincoln even later says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he could preserve the union by </v>

839
00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.530
<v Speaker 2>freeing all the slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll do that.</v>

840
00:44:13.531 --> 00:44:16.590
<v Speaker 2>If he could preserve the union by </v>
<v Speaker 2>framing some none of the slaves,</v>

841
00:44:16.591 --> 00:44:17.424
<v Speaker 2>he'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he can preserve the union by freeing </v>

842
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:22.260
<v Speaker 2>some and leaving others enslaved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would do that.</v>

843
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:26.360
<v Speaker 1>What was his real belief in the union </v>
<v Speaker 1>based in did he,</v>

844
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:31.390
<v Speaker 1>did he just truly believed that we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to remain one country otherwise would be</v>

845
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 1>perpetual</v>

846
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.263
<v Speaker 2>war?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

847
00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

848
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.850
<v Speaker 2>He thought that the disillusion of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>union would lead to anarchy.</v>

849
00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:41.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because now one of the </v>

850
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:48.111
<v Speaker 2>things that's one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about historians is the,</v>

851
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:49.143
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even historians who don't seem to be </v>

852
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:55.110
<v Speaker 2>explicitly nationalist than nationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>bias with which they,</v>

853
00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach that issue.</v>

854
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

855
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:01.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

856
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.893
<v Speaker 2>the US,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had made several attempts to an ex </v>

857
00:45:07.051 --> 00:45:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

858
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:10.650
<v Speaker 2>in the early history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

859
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.530
<v Speaker 2>first during the American revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then during the war of 18,</v>

860
00:45:13.531 --> 00:45:14.490
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

861
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:17.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between and after those events,</v>

862
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:18.503
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by sponsoring the kinds of a </v>

863
00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:23.240
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary movements that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

864
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.650
<v Speaker 2>brought Texas into the union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

865
00:45:25.651 --> 00:45:30.210
<v Speaker 2>If any of those had succeeded </v>
<v Speaker 2>historians,</v>

866
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:31.044
<v Speaker 2>would it be writing great historians </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be writing the history of North </v>

867
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.863
<v Speaker 2>America as if this was an inevitable in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any other result would have been </v>

868
00:45:39.121 --> 00:45:41.620
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

869
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:46.080
<v Speaker 2>my view is that the north,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

870
00:45:46.081 --> 00:45:49.500
<v Speaker 2>that the North American continent has </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten along fine with,</v>

871
00:45:49.501 --> 00:45:51.630
<v Speaker 2>to Anglo American republics.</v>

872
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:55.050
<v Speaker 2>If it had been three or more history </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been different,</v>

873
00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:58.050
<v Speaker 2>but would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't have been catastrophic,</v>

874
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:00.000
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

875
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.130
<v Speaker 2>and speaking of the example of Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

876
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.043
<v Speaker 2>when Canada was looking at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this session of the peaceful </v>

877
00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:07.764
<v Speaker 2>succession of Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its population was about the same size </v>

878
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.113
<v Speaker 2>as the union at the time and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population of Quebec was greater than </v>

879
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.613
<v Speaker 2>the Gulf coast confederacy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>initially succeeded and slightly less </v>

880
00:46:22.981 --> 00:46:26.610
<v Speaker 2>than the confederacy once a Lincoln had </v>
<v Speaker 2>called out troops.</v>

881
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.653
<v Speaker 2>Did Lincoln have any advisors or anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to him at the time that was just </v>

882
00:46:30.661 --> 00:46:31.770
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget this,</v>

883
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let them go.</v>

884
00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do,</v>

885
00:46:35.011 --> 00:46:37.250
<v Speaker 2>we live by our laws here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he really,</v>

886
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were some,</v>

887
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:39.893
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were some newspaper editors prior </v>

888
00:46:43.711 --> 00:46:44.544
<v Speaker 2>to Fort Sumpter who were in favor of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful succession and letting us out </v>

889
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.940
<v Speaker 2>south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least temporarily go in peace.</v>

890
00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was even a secessionist movement,</v>

891
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York City,</v>

892
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.250
<v Speaker 2>but I'm meaning they wanted New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>City to see.</v>

893
00:47:04.251 --> 00:47:04.980
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

894
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:05.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though geographically you've got </v>

895
00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:09.570
<v Speaker 2>really make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

896
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

897
00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln's,</v>

898
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:18.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a secretary of state,</v>

899
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:22.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toyed with the idea provoking a war with</v>

900
00:47:22.471 --> 00:47:27.471
<v Speaker 2>Great Britain in order to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody a steward.</v>

901
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm back together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

902
00:47:32.561 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody really,</v>

903
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:38.970
<v Speaker 2>at least within Republican Council's </v>
<v Speaker 2>excepted,</v>

904
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

905
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially after Fort Sumpter,</v>

906
00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the preservation of the union a becomes </v>

907
00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.890
<v Speaker 2>upper most God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so most of his presidency,</v>

908
00:47:50.891 --> 00:47:53.290
<v Speaker 2>which obviously was cut short and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to that shortly.</v>

909
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

910
00:47:55.061 --> 00:47:57.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was about the civil war is there.</v>

911
00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.010
<v Speaker 2>What else do we have to know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How sort of towards the end of the war,</v>

912
00:48:00.011 --> 00:48:02.470
<v Speaker 2>what other decisions did he make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were sort of pivotal?</v>

913
00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

914
00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:07.500
<v Speaker 2>he starts a reconstruction program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

915
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.210
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

916
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.120
<v Speaker 2>is relatively lenient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

917
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 2>compared to the congressional </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstruction,</v>

918
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:17.163
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is eventually implemented after a </v>

919
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:21.850
<v Speaker 2>whole Lincoln's assassination.</v>

920
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:23.463
<v Speaker 2>Limited in what regard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lenient in terms of allowing white </v>

921
00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:34.471
<v Speaker 2>southerners a free hand in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

922
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as they allow,</v>

923
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:41.380
<v Speaker 2>had abolished slavery of reentering a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the union.</v>

924
00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.660
<v Speaker 2>And how is that different than what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened?</v>

925
00:48:43.661 --> 00:48:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

926
00:48:44.741 --> 00:48:46.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

927
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.730
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a complicated story.</v>

928
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try and make it really </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple.</v>

929
00:48:50.111 --> 00:48:50.944
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have this first phase presidential </v>

930
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:52.923
<v Speaker 2>reconstruction which Lincoln initiates </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then becomes really lenient under </v>

931
00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:59.460
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

932
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

933
00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:06.290
<v Speaker 2>a successor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Johnson who was from Tennessee.</v>

934
00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

935
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.530
<v Speaker 2>but antislavery southerner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

936
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:20.740
<v Speaker 2>and what happens is that the southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>states essentially set up,</v>

937
00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm under a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

938
00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.673
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the former confederate </v>

939
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:27.004
<v Speaker 2>leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an apartheid regime with black codes </v>

940
00:49:29.501 --> 00:49:32.320
<v Speaker 2>that are very restrictive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

941
00:49:32.321 --> 00:49:33.154
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the activities of the freed African </v>

942
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Americans and this outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

943
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.363
<v Speaker 2>northern republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have a period of </v>

944
00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:49.760
<v Speaker 2>congressional reconstruction where none </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these governments are there.</v>

945
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.540
<v Speaker 2>They're all disbanded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have military occupation,</v>

946
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:56.710
<v Speaker 2>and then you have the creation of new </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican governments in which a lot of</v>

947
00:49:56.711 --> 00:49:57.544
<v Speaker 2>southerners are disenfranchised and </v>
<v Speaker 2>African Americans are given voting </v>

948
00:50:03.431 --> 00:50:04.264
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have a period of Republican </v>

949
00:50:05.801 --> 00:50:09.340
<v Speaker 2>regimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the south,</v>

950
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:10.623
<v Speaker 2>and then that creates the resistance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations like the Ku Klux Klan and </v>

951
00:50:16.391 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 2>other violent organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

952
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.793
<v Speaker 2>by 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>76 northerners have gotten tired of </v>

953
00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:27.040
<v Speaker 2>trying to maintain these regimes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>military occupation.</v>

954
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.610
<v Speaker 2>And so you have what's euphemistically </v>
<v Speaker 2>referred to as redemption where you have</v>

955
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:34.550
<v Speaker 2>the restoration of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of white rule,</v>

956
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:36.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the,</v>

957
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:38.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>former slave states.</v>

958
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

959
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.910
<v Speaker 1>it's just hard to imagine what a messy </v>
<v Speaker 1>time it would've been.</v>

960
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During those years,</v>

961
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:45.383
<v Speaker 1>just healing all those wounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally family members having killed </v>

962
00:50:48.001 --> 00:50:48.834
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in your border states like </v>

963
00:50:50.701 --> 00:50:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky and Missouri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

964
00:50:52.081 --> 00:50:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really just hard to imagine what it</v>

965
00:50:53.821 --> 00:50:54.654
<v Speaker 1>was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the north obviously wins does not </v>

966
00:50:57.841 --> 00:51:00.270
<v Speaker 1>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The union is maintained,</v>

967
00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.523
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was happening just in the weeks </v>

968
00:51:03.001 --> 00:51:05.100
<v Speaker 1>leading up to his assassination?</v>

969
00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lisa rendered,</v>

970
00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a same month,</v>

971
00:51:11.651 --> 00:51:15.670
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was clear that,</v>

972
00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

973
00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:18.700
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

974
00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:22.270
<v Speaker 2>it's clear that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the confederacy has lost the war.</v>

975
00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

976
00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.220
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

977
00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:30.280
<v Speaker 2>you have the passage of the 13th </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>

978
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:31.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Congress.</v>

979
00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:33.730
<v Speaker 2>It still has to be ratified by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>

980
00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a abolishing slavery,</v>

981
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

982
00:51:40.601 --> 00:51:41.261
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the,</v>

983
00:51:41.261 --> 00:51:42.910
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two most important,</v>

984
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>events leading up.</v>

985
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the end of the war.</v>

986
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:51.380
<v Speaker 1>So to talk about the assassination for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

987
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:52.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously just from everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about it and it was </v>

988
00:51:54.441 --> 00:51:56.440
<v Speaker 1>wartime and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>

989
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:58.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tensions were high and all that.</v>

990
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Was there any reason to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like this was gonna Happen?</v>

991
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I know that may sound like a very open </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

992
00:52:05.811 --> 00:52:06.710
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're,</v>

993
00:52:06.711 --> 00:52:09.290
<v Speaker 1>we're there as attempt attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassination attempts.</v>

994
00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

995
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:13.460
<v Speaker 2>I was always concerned about Lincoln </v>
<v Speaker 2>being assassinated,</v>

996
00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.200
<v Speaker 2>particularly at the outset of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

997
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.113
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pardon me at the outset of his </v>

998
00:52:20.101 --> 00:52:20.934
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he initially comes into </v>

999
00:52:24.181 --> 00:52:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1000
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:30.990
<v Speaker 2>he comes in disguised because of concern</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1001
00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:32.183
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an assassination of rumored </v>

1002
00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:37.230
<v Speaker 2>assassination attempts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then during the inauguration,</v>

1003
00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1004
00:52:39.211 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1005
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.793
<v Speaker 2>a sharp shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stationed at the tops of buildings </v>

1006
00:52:46.171 --> 00:52:47.004
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1007
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:47.933
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other provisions made by General </v>

1008
00:52:50.491 --> 00:52:51.324
<v Speaker 2>Winfield Scott to make sure that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is no assassination attempt because </v>

1009
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:59.430
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington DC is south of Maryland.</v>

1010
00:52:59.431 --> 00:53:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Maryland is a slave state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1011
00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:07.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a slave state that doesn't succeed </v>
<v Speaker 2>only partially because of union military</v>

1012
00:53:09.121 --> 00:53:09.954
<v Speaker 2>force interfering with elections and </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing secessionists I'm in jail and </v>

1013
00:53:15.181 --> 00:53:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1014
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.910
<v Speaker 2>is at least at the outset of the war is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pro southern,</v>

1015
00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:22.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hotbed.</v>

1016
00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there were concerns.</v>

1017
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1018
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have the secret service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1019
00:53:29.491 --> 00:53:32.340
<v Speaker 2>the secret service has created during </v>
<v Speaker 2>the civil war,</v>

1020
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:38.040
<v Speaker 2>mainly to track down counterfeiters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the many government agencies</v>

1021
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 2>that we've come to.</v>

1022
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:40.883
<v Speaker 1>All love emerges during the civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I started to track down </v>

1023
00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:46.314
<v Speaker 1>counterfeiters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's clearly gone beyond that scope </v>

1024
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 1>these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a whole other topic.</v>

1025
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.550
<v Speaker 1>So I assume that the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1026
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:54.384
<v Speaker 1>if we had to look at Lincoln the morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>he woke up before he went to the </v>

1027
00:53:56.701 --> 00:53:57.534
<v Speaker 1>theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to have been feeling pretty good </v>

1028
00:53:58.861 --> 00:53:59.910
<v Speaker 1>about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1029
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.773
<v Speaker 1>he had to be accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that was most important to </v>

1030
00:54:04.021 --> 00:54:06.630
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he certainly was feeling relieved.</v>

1031
00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should we talk about related to the</v>

1032
00:54:10.081 --> 00:54:12.580
<v Speaker 1>assassination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1033
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:14.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me the basics for people.</v>

1034
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:15.731
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1035
00:54:15.731 --> 00:54:16.564
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's now evidence that there </v>

1036
00:54:22.821 --> 00:54:27.821
<v Speaker 2>was more involvement of a confederate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1037
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:32.000
<v Speaker 2>counter intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you wanna call it.</v>

1038
00:54:32.001 --> 00:54:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Then we previously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1039
00:54:33.681 --> 00:54:38.280
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm John Wilkes booth and,</v>

1040
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:39.650
<v Speaker 2>and his confederates.</v>

1041
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Is there hard evidence on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1042
00:54:42.141 --> 00:54:43.070
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard little things.</v>

1043
00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:43.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1045
00:54:46.131 --> 00:54:47.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1046
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.370
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really have a lot to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1047
00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.400
<v Speaker 2>about the assassination of Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in so far as.</v>

1048
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1049
00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:04.130
<v Speaker 2>One of the big debates is if Lincoln </v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't been assassinated,</v>

1050
00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.050
<v Speaker 2>would he have continued,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1051
00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.120
<v Speaker 2>his lenient policy towards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1052
00:55:11.121 --> 00:55:11.954
<v Speaker 2>the southern states and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go along with the historians who </v>

1053
00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:23.150
<v Speaker 2>say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was trying.</v>

1054
00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm leniency in order to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reestablish the whig party.</v>

1055
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:34.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't turning out that way.</v>

1056
00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:35.773
<v Speaker 2>And a congressional reconstruction may </v>
<v Speaker 2>not have been quite as harsh under </v>

1057
00:55:40.851 --> 00:55:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1058
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:46.120
<v Speaker 2>as it turned out to be without Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1059
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:47.630
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1060
00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:53.110
<v Speaker 2>but Lincoln's views have evolved to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>extent that he would not have been,</v>

1061
00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.273
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been willing to tolerate the </v>

1062
00:55:56.601 --> 00:55:58.330
<v Speaker 2>black codes that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1063
00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:01.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the states were setting up,</v>

1064
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:02.403
<v Speaker 1>do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly by his second term where he </v>

1065
00:56:03.561 --> 00:56:04.394
<v Speaker 1>would've had a freer hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have done a lot of the things </v>

1066
00:56:06.171 --> 00:56:07.004
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happen during congressional </v>

1067
00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:08.811
<v Speaker 1>reconstruction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1068
00:56:08.811 --> 00:56:10.070
<v Speaker 1>that's my speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.530
<v Speaker 1>What was it like after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassination?</v>

1070
00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like any assassination,</v>

1071
00:56:15.761 --> 00:56:16.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1072
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:18.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1073
00:56:18.051 --> 00:56:23.051
<v Speaker 2>there is a man hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1074
00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:26.680
<v Speaker 2>there is an attempt to track down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy,</v>

1075
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1076
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:35.140
<v Speaker 2>you have several conspirators hung </v>
<v Speaker 2>including Mary Serat who,</v>

1077
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.500
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of controversy about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether she was actually involved or not</v>

1078
00:56:38.501 --> 00:56:43.300
<v Speaker 2>involved and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1079
00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 2>so it certainly hardens northern </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitudes.</v>

1080
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but remember,</v>

1081
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.153
<v Speaker 1>was there really a feeling that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one keeping it all together at that </v>

1082
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:54.371
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still are,</v>

1083
00:56:54.371 --> 00:56:57.520
<v Speaker 1>or what was the feeling that the war had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been won?</v>

1084
00:56:57.521 --> 00:56:59.410
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was going to be okay either way,</v>

1085
00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:00.244
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was such a symbol of what had </v>

1086
00:57:01.511 --> 00:57:02.344
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1087
00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1088
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.150
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had already,</v>

1089
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting question.</v>

1090
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some circles,</v>

1091
00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:20.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had already become deified but not to</v>

1092
00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:26.710
<v Speaker 2>the extent that the assassination dfi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1093
00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:29.170
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1094
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.990
<v Speaker 2>he remember he'd already been elected </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a second term,</v>

1095
00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:32.903
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he did not face a significant </v>

1096
00:57:36.701 --> 00:57:41.701
<v Speaker 2>political opposition there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there before the fall of Atlanta,</v>

1097
00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:42.560
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1098
00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.160
<v Speaker 2>there because the war dragged on so </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

1099
00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:46.623
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't always clear that Lincoln </v>

1100
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:49.564
<v Speaker 2>would be renominated by the Republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>Party and there were elements in the </v>

1101
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Republican Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1102
00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:58.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wanted to replace him and rivals who</v>

1103
00:57:58.271 --> 00:58:01.780
<v Speaker 2>wanted to replace him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1104
00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:06.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really,</v>

1105
00:58:06.791 --> 00:58:09.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1106
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:10.473
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

1107
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.560
<v Speaker 2>you have Andrew Johnson being president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1108
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:16.420
<v Speaker 2>for most of Lincoln's second term and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1109
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:21.160
<v Speaker 2>he's impeached or almost he's impeached </v>
<v Speaker 2>and almost removed,</v>

1110
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:23.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1111
00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:27.730
<v Speaker 2>from office because of his disagreement </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1112
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:31.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans who are in tight control</v>

1113
00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:34.860
<v Speaker 2>of Congress because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1114
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:38.770
<v Speaker 2>the southern states have been kept out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are still not in,</v>

1115
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:41.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except for Tennessee.</v>

1116
00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the slave states that didn't succeed</v>

1117
00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still not,</v>

1118
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:47.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1119
00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:47.973
<v Speaker 2>in the union or are permitted to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>representatives in Congress so the </v>

1120
00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:52.324
<v Speaker 2>Republicans have a free hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrespective of whether Lincolns in </v>

1121
00:58:55.781 --> 00:58:59.170
<v Speaker 2>office or Andrew Johnson's and office or</v>
<v Speaker 2>grant is an office.</v>

1122
00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:00.263
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the reasons that I wanted to </v>

1123
00:59:01.461 --> 00:59:02.294
<v Speaker 1>do this youtube week was to help frame </v>
<v Speaker 1>things around how politics are right </v>

1124
00:59:06.261 --> 00:59:09.230
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to sort of wrap all this up first,</v>

1125
00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:10.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1126
00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:11.813
<v Speaker 1>what do you think Lincoln's politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be today if you were to try to </v>

1127
00:59:15.711 --> 00:59:16.544
<v Speaker 1>take the things that you think he </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed in the most within the sort of </v>

1128
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 1>modern context?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a that you can make sense of it</v>

1129
00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.330
<v Speaker 1>because I see he gets used by everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1130
00:59:26.331 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln would have been a Republican for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1131
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:30.060
<v Speaker 1>He would have been a Democrat for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way</v>

1132
00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.660
<v Speaker 2>like playing that game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1133
00:59:32.890 --> 00:59:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things have changed so much.</v>

1134
00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1135
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:41.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

1136
00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:43.690
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the context is so different.</v>

1137
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to say.</v>

1138
00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

1139
00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:51.010
<v Speaker 2>one of the interesting things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln,</v>

1140
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:52.833
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my sort of reservations are </v>

1141
00:59:59.801 --> 01:00:00.634
<v Speaker 2>criticisms of Lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually criticisms of the people who </v>

1142
01:00:03.311 --> 01:00:08.311
<v Speaker 2>deify Lincoln as president is the whig </v>
<v Speaker 2>party,</v>

1143
01:00:08.831 --> 01:00:13.831
<v Speaker 2>had this ambivalent attitude in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>government versus the presidency.</v>

1144
01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.173
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were in favor of a lot of </v>

1145
01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:19.950
<v Speaker 2>government intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1146
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.823
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time they had emerged in</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition to Andrew Jackson and his </v>

1147
01:00:24.581 --> 01:00:29.020
<v Speaker 2>very vigorous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often high handed presidency.</v>

1148
01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:34.320
<v Speaker 2>So they tended to favor the legislature </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the dominant.</v>

1149
01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mover,</v>

1150
01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:42.430
<v Speaker 2>a forest in the government rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the presidency.</v>

1151
01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:47.710
<v Speaker 2>And I think Lincoln had imbibed this wig</v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude,</v>

1152
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:49.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1153
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:52.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>

1154
01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:58.020
<v Speaker 2>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm being a wartime president.</v>

1155
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:59.343
<v Speaker 2>He had to ignore it to a large extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that it created some of the </v>

1156
01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:10.890
<v Speaker 2>administrative problems that emerged </v>
<v Speaker 2>during Lincoln's presidency.</v>

1157
01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:17.850
<v Speaker 2>So I think Lincoln would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd have very ambivalent feelings about</v>

1158
01:01:19.871 --> 01:01:24.871
<v Speaker 2>how powerful the president has become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>within government,</v>

1159
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:27.550
<v Speaker 2>irrespective of what policies are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>implemented.</v>

1160
01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:28.563
<v Speaker 1>I will accept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will accept that as an answer that </v>

1161
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:31.630
<v Speaker 1>that really was what I was trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1162
01:01:31.631 --> 01:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>not that he would have endorsed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy or that policy,</v>

1163
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:38.570
<v Speaker 1>but just his general take on what power </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the opposite of the presidency and,</v>

1164
01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:40.420
<v Speaker 1>and things of that nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1165
01:01:40.421 --> 01:01:41.950
<v Speaker 1>it's been a pleasure talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1166
01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Are we done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're done.</v>

1167
01:01:43.031 --> 01:01:45.520
<v Speaker 1>We did the whole hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a pretty quick.</v>

1168
01:01:45.521 --> 01:01:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we miss anything made doing this?</v>

1169
01:01:47.801 --> 01:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of major things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1170
01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Give me something major that we missed.</v>

1171
01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I,</v>

1172
01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:52.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1173
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:53.910
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a couple of things.</v>

1174
01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:56.010
<v Speaker 2>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean my book,</v>

1175
01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.120
<v Speaker 2>you didn't mention my book.</v>

1176
01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.153
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think you've sort of hit on it </v>

1177
01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your more critical,</v>

1178
01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>more critical altman in the war then </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the people who.</v>

1179
01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:06.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book is a narrative history of the </v>

1180
01:02:07.901 --> 01:02:08.734
<v Speaker 2>civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have about half a dozen </v>

1181
01:02:11.171 --> 01:02:16.171
<v Speaker 2>provocative thesis where I disagree with</v>
<v Speaker 2>trailing views and one of them is that I</v>

1182
01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:22.321
<v Speaker 2>argue that if I'm northerners had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in ending slavery rather than</v>

1183
01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:27.414
<v Speaker 2>preserving the union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a set of policies they could </v>

1184
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.940
<v Speaker 2>have adopted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm allowing,</v>

1185
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lower south to go in peace,</v>

1186
01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would have brought down slavery,</v>

1187
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:41.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within,</v>

1188
01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an independent confederacy,</v>

1189
01:02:43.531 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 2>certainly by the turn of the century and</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly within four years.</v>

1190
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Why letting them go would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1191
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.260
<v Speaker 2>well letting them go didn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1192
01:02:52.261 --> 01:02:56.010
<v Speaker 2>It just means that you didn't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill 750,000</v>

1193
01:02:56.011 --> 01:02:58.230
<v Speaker 2>people in order to bring about the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of slavery.</v>

1194
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:59.910
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there were,</v>

1195
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.113
<v Speaker 2>there is there a set of policies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could achieve the same goal at less </v>

1196
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:05.244
<v Speaker 2>cost.</v>

1197
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1198
01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:09.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in other words,</v>

1199
01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1200
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.813
<v Speaker 2>I was actually t I'm tuned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don turned onto this alternative by </v>

1201
01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:19.700
<v Speaker 2>garrison and the other radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>abolitionist.</v>

1202
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:23.680
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be a rabidly antislavery instill</v>

1203
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.240
<v Speaker 2>procession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1204
01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:28.160
<v Speaker 2>the second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1205
01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:31.350
<v Speaker 2>important argument I make is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to do with,</v>

1206
01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the growth of government.</v>

1207
01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1208
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a commonplace observation </v>

1209
01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:41.574
<v Speaker 2>that government today is a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful and a lot more intrusive than </v>

1210
01:03:45.181 --> 01:03:46.014
<v Speaker 2>it was earlier in our history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And whether you think that's a good </v>

1211
01:03:50.041 --> 01:03:52.230
<v Speaker 2>thing or a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1212
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.980
<v Speaker 2>there's the question of what changed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what brought about the change.</v>

1213
01:03:55.981 --> 01:04:00.120
<v Speaker 2>So I'm the popular story is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the new deal,</v>

1214
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.073
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That made the big change and I'm in the </v>

1215
01:04:03.901 --> 01:04:06.120
<v Speaker 2>growth of government and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistaken,</v>

1216
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.040
<v Speaker 2>it's mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1217
01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:09.874
<v Speaker 2>in part because of the new deal was </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially a recreation of Woodrow </v>

1218
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Wilson's war collectivism.</v>

1219
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:17.243
<v Speaker 2>And the impact of the new deal on </v>
<v Speaker 2>government was dwarfed by the impact of </v>

1220
01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:24.050
<v Speaker 2>World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1221
01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:27.330
<v Speaker 2>now there's some elements of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new deal gives you social security,</v>

1222
01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:28.323
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and along with Medicare that's become </v>

1223
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:33.780
<v Speaker 2>government's biggest expenditures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More sophisticated,</v>

1224
01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:34.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commentators would push the change back </v>

1225
01:04:38.521 --> 01:04:41.190
<v Speaker 2>to the progressive era in the early 20th</v>
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>

1226
01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:42.024
<v Speaker 2>But I'm arguing that the civil war is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the crucial watershed in American </v>

1227
01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:48.600
<v Speaker 2>history that prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prior to the civil war,</v>

1228
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.673
<v Speaker 2>the longterm secular trend had at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of government for government to </v>

1229
01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:56.310
<v Speaker 2>become smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less intrusive,</v>

1230
01:04:56.311 --> 01:04:57.144
<v Speaker 2>less involved in people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that the turning point is the civil </v>

1231
01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:06.780
<v Speaker 2>war that leaves him with a complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>legacy from the government.</v>

1232
01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1233
01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1234
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because during the civil war,</v>

1235
01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>national conscription,</v>

1236
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:18.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm a US moves from free to high </v>
<v Speaker 2>protective tariffs,</v>

1237
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first Western country to do.</v>

1238
01:05:21.641 --> 01:05:26.641
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a massive subsidies to railroads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1239
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:31.780
<v Speaker 2>for subsidies to higher education </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the land grants.</v>

1240
01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've already gone over my time.</v>

1241
01:05:35.051 --> 01:05:35.884
<v Speaker 2>I could go on.</v>

1242
01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.140
<v Speaker 1>You got one more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one more big,</v>

1243
01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.890
<v Speaker 1>big point that's in the book related.</v>

1244
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:42.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One more point that's related to </v>

1245
01:05:43.521 --> 01:05:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1246
01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:48.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that one of the reasons it takes</v>

1247
01:05:48.471 --> 01:05:49.304
<v Speaker 2>the union so long to defeat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>confederacy is because of Lincoln's bad </v>

1248
01:05:54.321 --> 01:05:57.770
<v Speaker 2>administration of the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1249
01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:02.030
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tended to micromanage.</v>

1250
01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1251
01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:08.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Lyndon Johnson tried to micromanage</v>

1252
01:06:08.301 --> 01:06:09.134
<v Speaker 2>the Vietnam war and historians want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>place all of the blame on Lincoln's </v>

1253
01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:18.200
<v Speaker 2>generals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1254
01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.580
<v Speaker 2>whereas I think that really the source </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the problem is Lincoln.</v>

1255
01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consider the eastern theater.</v>

1256
01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:26.540
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1257
01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a succession of commanders.</v>

1258
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Irvin Mcdowell defeated the first bull </v>
<v Speaker 2>run,</v>

1259
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.780
<v Speaker 2>replaced my Mcclellan Mcclellan is </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost supplanted by John Pope,</v>

1260
01:06:35.781 --> 01:06:36.614
<v Speaker 2>who's defeated the second bull run only </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bring back McClellan then to replace </v>

1261
01:06:39.801 --> 01:06:40.634
<v Speaker 2>him with burnside who admitted to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>emitted that he wasn't ready to command </v>

1262
01:06:44.721 --> 01:06:48.770
<v Speaker 2>the army and then hooker and then meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now normally.</v>

1263
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:49.723
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is within a period of two </v>

1264
01:06:50.931 --> 01:06:51.764
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1265
01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:55.010
<v Speaker 2>two and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normally this doesn't work.</v>

1266
01:06:55.070 --> 01:07:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Earn administrators high marks in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how they're managing things.</v>

1267
01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1268
01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1269
01:07:07.731 --> 01:07:08.564
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were problems with all the </v>

1270
01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:11.600
<v Speaker 2>generals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1271
01:07:11.601 --> 01:07:12.434
<v Speaker 2>the advantage that the generals in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>West had Sherman and grant is they </v>

1272
01:07:15.771 --> 01:07:19.910
<v Speaker 2>weren't micromanaged by Lincoln and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore they could make their mistakes</v>

1273
01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:21.650
<v Speaker 2>early in the war and learn from them.</v>

1274
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:22.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1275
01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I liked that you gave us a complex view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1276
01:07:24.531 --> 01:07:26.600
<v Speaker 1>that's really why I wanted to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1277
01:07:26.601 --> 01:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we picked certain ones.</v>

1278
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.963
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln is one that we all sort of view </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this lens of the perfect being </v>

1279
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course he did a tremendous amount</v>

1280
01:07:38.271 --> 01:07:39.300
<v Speaker 1>of good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1281
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting hearing what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little imperfections are a and all sorts</v>

1282
01:07:43.371 --> 01:07:44.570
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on that note,</v>

1283
01:07:44.571 --> 01:07:47.420
<v Speaker 1>it has been a pleasure talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for more,</v>

1284
01:07:47.421 --> 01:07:48.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Rogers,</v>

1285
01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.273
<v Speaker 1>I'm all check out his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're going to link to write down </v>

1286
01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.473
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>
