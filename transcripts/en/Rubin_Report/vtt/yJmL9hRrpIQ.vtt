1
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.963
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea out there that 97% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate scientists agree that manmade </v>

2
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>climate change is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a little digging on this.</v>

3
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>97% and surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise,</v>

4
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>depending on what websites you go to and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sources you trust.</v>

5
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>The answer actually isn't so clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is clear for sure,</v>

6
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:24.264
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the overwhelming amount of </v>

7
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:26.754
<v Speaker 1>climate scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very experts in this field do agree </v>

8
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:31.134
<v Speaker 1>that the climate is changing and it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do with what humans are </v>

9
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:35.184
<v Speaker 1>putting into our atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not the exact number is </v>

10
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:43.041
<v Speaker 1>really 97% or 86% or 75% is largely </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.723
<v Speaker 1>The point is that the vast amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who study this for a living </v>

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.833
<v Speaker 1>believe it to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't discussed a ton on climate </v>

13
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>change since we've started the Rubin </v>
<v Speaker 1>report,</v>

14
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>but I've said several times on the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>that since I'm not a scientist,</v>

15
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I have to go on what the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists say.</v>

16
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Thus I accept man made climate change as</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

17
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm basing my belief on the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that I have in front of me.</v>

18
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't just get to pick and choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you believe in science,</v>

19
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 1>it either is fact or it is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the vast amount of scientists that</v>

20
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>are professionals in this industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe something to be true,</v>

21
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.553
<v Speaker 1>then I have to base my opinion on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than just guessing or hoping or </v>

22
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>picking the random scientists that see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world the way I want it to be.</v>

23
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.093
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should always be skeptical of who </v>

24
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:35.484
<v Speaker 1>funds what scientific study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are political aims behind the </v>

25
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:39.624
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially if there's money to be </v>

26
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>made by claiming something as fact when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth remains more elusive.</v>

27
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.913
<v Speaker 1>A simple example of this of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if a tobacco company funded </v>

28
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.274
<v Speaker 1>studies on smoking and human health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd all be a bit more leery of it then </v>

29
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>a truly independent study done for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>purely research purposes.</v>

30
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.693
<v Speaker 1>So with all this in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe from all the people I've </v>

31
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as Dr.</v>

32
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.243
<v Speaker 1>Michael Mann,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creator of the hockey stick theory </v>

33
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>or my own science guru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cara Santa Maria,</v>

34
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>as well as the information in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

35
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.803
<v Speaker 1>that manmade climate change is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also believe that the national </v>

36
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>conversation around climate change is </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly idiotic,</v>

37
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:20.664
<v Speaker 1>usually vacillating between people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>think we're on the brink of a </v>

38
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:28.191
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic climactic disaster and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who hide their head in the sand to</v>

39
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>the realities of the changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

40
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Like most things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I always say this right,</v>

41
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:34.224
<v Speaker 1>the answer is probably somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between and that's where we have to </v>

42
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>start having these important </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>

43
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>And my guest this week is the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Center for Industrial Progress,</v>

44
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Alex Epstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The center is a nonprofit think tank,</v>

45
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>which believes in creating a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial revolution through technology</v>

46
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>to improve the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex's book,</v>

47
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:55.314
<v Speaker 1>the moral case for fossil fuels lays out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument that fossil fuels have not </v>

48
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:00.994
<v Speaker 1>only been an incredibly positive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>important piece for the advancement of </v>

49
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:05.284
<v Speaker 1>mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even now in 2016 they are still the </v>

50
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>best source of energy for humans to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most of this world.</v>

51
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.850
<v Speaker 1>His book also tackles many of the myths </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding fossil fuels and even has me</v>

52
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:18.874
<v Speaker 1>challenging many of my own assumptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of how much fossil fuels are truly </v>

53
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>affecting the environment and if we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonized in energy source,</v>

54
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>that still is a lot of great potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help mankind.</v>

55
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.243
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I continue and before people </v>

56
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>start freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me stop.</v>

57
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Those of you who are going to say I </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruben's a climate change denier for even</v>

58
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>talking to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

59
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:38.824
<v Speaker 1>that really is not the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who I am is someone who is willing </v>

60
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>to have the provocative and complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation that surrounds it.</v>

61
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.643
<v Speaker 1>You guys know that I've made this show </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the battle of ideas and Alex is </v>

62
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>ideas are considered basically heretical</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some elite circles.</v>

63
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:56.074
<v Speaker 1>He's had a public spat with Al Gore and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been subpoenaed in a lawsuit that </v>

64
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>the Justice Department has brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Exxon Mobile.</v>

65
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Even though he himself has done nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong other than share his ideas.</v>

66
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.243
<v Speaker 1>In a truly free society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must allow all ideas to flourish </v>

67
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>because sunlight is the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>disinfectant.</v>

68
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>If Alex is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas are bad,</v>

69
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.674
<v Speaker 1>the only way we can truly refute them is</v>
<v Speaker 1>by proving them to be so not by banning </v>

70
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>the discussion altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why the twitter band,</v>

71
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos a couple weeks ago was</v>
<v Speaker 1>so awful,</v>

72
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>even if it was within twitter is right </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do so.</v>

73
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Surely Milo's ideas weren't the worst of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the ideas on twitter,</v>

74
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>but he had gained influence that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't control,</v>

75
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.773
<v Speaker 1>so they shut him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Nazi sympathizers in Isis </v>

76
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>supporters remained there freely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think Milo's ideas are bad?</v>

77
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then use your voice on social media</v>

78
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>to call him out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think Alex is ideas are bad.</v>

79
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:53.314
<v Speaker 1>Well then write a book refuting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The risk we face is that banning those </v>

80
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:58.324
<v Speaker 1>who we disagree with and suing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who say saying we don't like will </v>

81
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:02.464
<v Speaker 1>eventually become the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I think the new battle in </v>

82
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 1>front of us is about authoritarians </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus libertarians.</v>

83
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:10.204
<v Speaker 1>People who want to tell you how to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus people who want you to think on </v>

84
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:15.004
<v Speaker 1>your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you guys know which side I'm on </v>

85
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>and if you're listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right there with me.</v>

86
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.760
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is an activist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>author and president and founder of this</v>

87
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>center for industrial progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Epstein,</v>

88
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:34.070
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

89
00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:34.904
<v Speaker 1>Good to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a feeling that I'm going to </v>

90
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:37.714
<v Speaker 1>be in a lot of trouble just for having </v>
<v Speaker 1>this book on the table just for putting </v>

91
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>this book that you've written right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between us.</v>

92
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 1>People are going to be angry right off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bat.</v>

93
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the end of this interview,</v>

94
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>they'll be converts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.483
<v Speaker 1>Who are going to convert people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll see the method of thinking just </v>

96
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>just makes so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm glad that we're starting with,</v>

98
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.123
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little piece of information right </v>

99
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:00.314
<v Speaker 1>there because first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have recommended that I </v>

100
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:03.074
<v Speaker 1>have you on the show people that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and people that don't like you just </v>

101
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:06.194
<v Speaker 1>because we do conversation here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've said before that my policy on </v>

102
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>climate change is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a scientist,</v>

103
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:14.054
<v Speaker 1>so I have to sort of believe what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists tell me what the majority of </v>

104
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:18.344
<v Speaker 1>scientists tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned that to you before in the </v>

105
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>green room for a second and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't sold on that concept.</v>

106
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

107
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has.</v>

108
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Traction is really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

109
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.003
<v Speaker 2>let's apply that to eugenics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say we're in the early 19 </v>

110
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:30.974
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of public declared </v>

111
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 2>scientific consensus that the gene pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>is being diluted.</v>

112
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 2>That we need to sterilize people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there's what I call global domain,</v>

113
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because all the dumb people are sleeping</v>

114
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 2>with each other and procreating and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>this societal catastrophe.</v>

115
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:45.944
<v Speaker 2>The gene pool is going to degrade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we need the inferiors to stop </v>

116
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:50.780
<v Speaker 2>procreating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to sterilize them more.</v>

117
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:51.614
<v Speaker 2>On the case of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to do much more dramatically </v>

118
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:54.494
<v Speaker 2>negative things to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see these scientific consensus </v>

119
00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:58.030
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well I had,</v>

120
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a,</v>

121
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't obey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's,</v>

122
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you do that or would you,</v>

123
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's very clear to me that uh,</v>

124
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.023
<v Speaker 1>we have dumbed down things significantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm pretty sure we're going </v>

125
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>idiocracy at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.520
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

127
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.210
<v Speaker 1>but all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we didn't sterilize enough.</v>

128
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no one,</v>

129
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get into that trouble for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

130
00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:16.780
<v Speaker 1>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see your point.</v>

131
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what we're going to do here.</v>

132
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:18.671
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

133
00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:22.270
<v Speaker 1>So first off the book is called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral case for fossil fuels.</v>

134
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.463
<v Speaker 1>So let's do a little fossil fuel 101 </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was watching a couple of your </v>

135
00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:27.364
<v Speaker 1>videos on youtube and you got a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>video where you're standing in New York </v>

136
00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:30.214
<v Speaker 1>City and all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess green activists are walking </v>

137
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.740
<v Speaker 1>through and you have a sign and it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love fossil fuels.</v>

138
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.200
<v Speaker 1>And they're just yelling slogans at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Forgetting who's right or wrong for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

140
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:42.910
<v Speaker 1>like they're just yelling things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of what you were trying</v>

141
00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:45.610
<v Speaker 1>to show them was that they didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what they were saying really.</v>

142
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.980
<v Speaker 1>So I thought if we just define some </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms to start,</v>

143
00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:50.830
<v Speaker 1>that would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are fossil fuels?</v>

144
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you had asked them,</v>

145
00:07:52.351 --> 00:07:55.620
<v Speaker 2>and I do this in universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often I'll do a poll and I'll say,</v>

146
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.663
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who here believes that fossil fuels are </v>

147
00:07:57.781 --> 00:07:58.614
<v Speaker 2>an unnecessary evil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which means we can get rid of them </v>

148
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:02.490
<v Speaker 2>quickly and we should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:08:02.491 --> 00:08:04.080
<v Speaker 2>there this addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to get rid of them quickly,</v>

150
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Half the room will raise your hands.</v>

151
00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:06.061
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

152
00:08:06.061 --> 00:08:07.890
<v Speaker 2>who believes that they're a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil?</v>

153
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.210
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really bad.</v>

154
00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:10.770
<v Speaker 2>But we're stuck with them for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of time.</v>

155
00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:12.420
<v Speaker 2>The other half raised their hand and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

156
00:08:12.421 --> 00:08:15.960
<v Speaker 2>who believes they're a superior good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we use them because overall they're</v>

157
00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:16.794
<v Speaker 2>the best for human life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I raised my hand and if anyone's </v>

158
00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:19.630
<v Speaker 2>read my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they raised their hand wrong,</v>

159
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.540
<v Speaker 2>or at least some of them do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

160
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.410
<v Speaker 2>And then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

161
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:23.700
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a harder question.</v>

162
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Who here can tell me what fossil fuels </v>
<v Speaker 2>are?</v>

163
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Nobody raises</v>

164
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.333
<v Speaker 1>Saturday.</v>

165
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a good lesson.</v>

166
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 2>And people actually take the lesson </v>
<v Speaker 2>despite being a quote idiocracy and this</v>

167
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:34.664
<v Speaker 2>isn't very high level schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't like a poker tele attack or </v>

168
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:38.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might even know more.</v>

169
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:39.434
<v Speaker 2>But I remember doing it this at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wellesley and I think the video is </v>

170
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:44.480
<v Speaker 2>online and you can see and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I make the point well,</v>

171
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.513
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a precondition of having an </v>

172
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:47.414
<v Speaker 2>opinion of whether something is good or </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad isn't a precondition that we know </v>

173
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 2>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

174
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.210
<v Speaker 2>So I appreciate the questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

175
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 2>So the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

176
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you how I like to define</v>

177
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think most people,</v>

178
00:08:58.411 --> 00:08:59.244
<v Speaker 1>I think when they think fossil fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pictured that little cartoon in </v>

179
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Jurassic Park when they're explaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they got the,</v>

180
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 1>the dinosaur DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're showing you,</v>

181
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur decomposing sort of,</v>

182
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.970
<v Speaker 1>and then suddenly it turned to oil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we pull that away.</v>

183
00:09:10.971 --> 00:09:11.804
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I think what most people in the </v>

184
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 1>most simplistic way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's think it's something like that,</v>

185
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:17.064
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to let you run</v>

186
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.230
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just think it's just,</v>

187
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.860
<v Speaker 2>just filth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like dirt and fill,</v>

188
00:09:23.861 --> 00:09:24.694
<v Speaker 2>finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just you have this dirty thing and then </v>

189
00:09:25.811 --> 00:09:26.644
<v Speaker 2>you just blow it into smoke and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything looks like China and we </v>

190
00:09:29.681 --> 00:09:31.230
<v Speaker 2>really need to stop using it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

191
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much the visual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

192
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now tell me what it really,</v>

193
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it this way.</v>

194
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Fossil fuels are a hoe and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll break this down,</v>

195
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's a high energy hydrocarbon </v>
<v Speaker 2>derived from ancient life.</v>

196
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:46.623
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a high energy hydrocarbon </v>

197
00:09:47.531 --> 00:09:48.364
<v Speaker 2>derived from ancient life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hydrocarbon is one of the key </v>

198
00:09:51.461 --> 00:09:52.294
<v Speaker 2>concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a combination primarily of </v>

199
00:09:53.501 --> 00:09:56.020
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen and carbon atoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

200
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.720
<v Speaker 2>you can probably guess this from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole co2 controversy.</v>

201
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Basically you have different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

202
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:02.064
<v Speaker 2>So you have natural gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has a high ratio of hydrogen to </v>

203
00:10:03.941 --> 00:10:04.360
<v Speaker 2>carbon.</v>

204
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.670
<v Speaker 2>That's why when you burn it and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>missed the Lisio too,</v>

205
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.300
<v Speaker 2>and then Cole has the highest ratio of </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbon to hydrogen.</v>

206
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.730
<v Speaker 2>That's why it emits the most CO2 when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you burn it,</v>

207
00:10:12.731 --> 00:10:15.760
<v Speaker 2>to burn something as to oxidize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to combine it with oxygen.</v>

208
00:10:15.761 --> 00:10:16.594
<v Speaker 2>So whenever you burn a hydrocarbon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get h two o and c o two plus </v>

209
00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:22.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever else is attached to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydrocarbon.</v>

210
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.200
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that this chemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure stores in enormous,</v>

211
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.870
<v Speaker 2>enormous amount of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also,</v>

212
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:29.763
<v Speaker 2>and also turns out that the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>plant life or ancient life that this </v>

213
00:10:32.561 --> 00:10:34.240
<v Speaker 2>comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different kinds of life.</v>

214
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.553
<v Speaker 2>It turns out there was so much of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have almost unfathomable amount </v>

215
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:40.610
<v Speaker 2>of the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

216
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.733
<v Speaker 2>my best estimates that I've seen are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really dozens more than we've used in </v>

217
00:10:44.171 --> 00:10:45.970
<v Speaker 2>the entire history of industrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

218
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.610
<v Speaker 2>So with this gives us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an energy perspective,</v>

219
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.870
<v Speaker 2>is an extremely concentrated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>plentiful source of energy that starting</v>

220
00:10:52.871 --> 00:10:55.870
<v Speaker 2>about 300 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we developed the technology to harness.</v>

221
00:10:55.871 --> 00:10:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Before that it was useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once we developed the steam engine,</v>

222
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.390
<v Speaker 2>the internal combustion engine oil </v>
<v Speaker 2>refining,</v>

223
00:11:01.391 --> 00:11:02.224
<v Speaker 2>modern natural gas technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this became by far the dominant method </v>

224
00:11:05.261 --> 00:11:06.970
<v Speaker 2>of producing energy around the world.</v>

225
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.330
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's pause there for a second.</v>

226
00:11:08.331 --> 00:11:10.580
<v Speaker 1>So basically this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this former life.</v>

227
00:11:10.581 --> 00:11:12.200
<v Speaker 1>So its former plant life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal life,</v>

228
00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:13.270
<v Speaker 1>it's all the stuff they did.</v>

229
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:14.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like playing on or it's familiar </v>

230
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 2>divisions like coal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has,</v>

231
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coal is more sort of terrestrial,</v>

232
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.750
<v Speaker 2>other things are more underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an,</v>

233
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean technically it doesn't strictly </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to be from life.</v>

234
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:28.200
<v Speaker 2>And there are many theories that some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it at least isn't it take like Saturn,</v>

235
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:28.680
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sat,</v>

236
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Saturn's rings are made of natural gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're made of method.</v>

237
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's something that occurs in a non </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological form.</v>

238
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.203
<v Speaker 2>But for many reasons we think most of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is biological and that has some </v>

239
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:41.300
<v Speaker 2>implications for how long it lasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

240
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.121
<v Speaker 2>Over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

241
00:11:42.121 --> 00:11:42.954
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that we're running out of it </v>

242
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:46.800
<v Speaker 2>quickly has gone out of fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

243
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:47.634
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because we keep discovering new </v>

244
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.700
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

245
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.743
<v Speaker 2>the base amount of the material </v>
<v Speaker 2>underground is staggering and it might </v>

246
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 2>be far more staggering than we think.</v>

247
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I never thought of that.</v>

248
00:11:57.991 --> 00:12:00.180
<v Speaker 1>So specifically because I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

249
00:12:00.181 --> 00:12:02.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were always saying,</v>

250
00:12:02.431 --> 00:12:03.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to run out of this,</v>

251
00:12:03.421 --> 00:12:04.530
<v Speaker 1>we're going to run out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

252
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.260
<v Speaker 1>But now it seems like we're finding gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields all over the place,</v>

253
00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:09.450
<v Speaker 1>aren't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finding crazy new gas fields in the,</v>

254
00:12:09.451 --> 00:12:12.720
<v Speaker 1>in the Mediterranean right now and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the Middle East.</v>

255
00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that happening right now as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak?</v>

256
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.960
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two things that can happen.</v>

257
00:12:15.961 --> 00:12:19.170
<v Speaker 2>One is you can find a stock of more raw </v>
<v Speaker 2>material,</v>

258
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.063
<v Speaker 2>which is always happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other and often more </v>

259
00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:22.584
<v Speaker 2>consequential is that you can find a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use existing raw material that was </v>

260
00:12:25.831 --> 00:12:29.100
<v Speaker 2>previously unusable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole shale energy revolution,</v>

261
00:12:29.101 --> 00:12:32.940
<v Speaker 2>which people over simplify as fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an example of that.</v>

262
00:12:32.941 --> 00:12:34.740
<v Speaker 2>That's where you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

263
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.720
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this material called shale,</v>

264
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.733
<v Speaker 2>which had oil and gas in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was locked in too tightly to get </v>

265
00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:41.064
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have this modern combination of </v>

266
00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:45.840
<v Speaker 2>technologies that unlocked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just as an example in the book,</v>

267
00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Atlas shrugged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has,</v>

268
00:12:46.681 --> 00:12:47.940
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is my favorite book.</v>

269
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

270
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.710
<v Speaker 2>one of the heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ellis,</v>

271
00:12:49.711 --> 00:12:50.544
<v Speaker 2>why discovers a method for getting oil </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of shale and 50 years later this </v>

272
00:12:55.231 --> 00:12:56.180
<v Speaker 2>actually happened,</v>

273
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.133
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're going to get to some </v>

274
00:12:57.411 --> 00:12:59.390
<v Speaker 1>objective as him and I and ran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that must have been</v>

275
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.580
<v Speaker 2>particularly that particularly rewarding</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>

276
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 2>but that show that just shows how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know often know of the raw material,</v>

277
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:09.220
<v Speaker 2>but we can't make it a resource until we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have sufficient human ingenuity.</v>

278
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

279
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.513
<v Speaker 1>now fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about it a little bit </v>

280
00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:14.760
<v Speaker 1>quick and then we'll get back to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fracking,</v>

281
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:16.230
<v Speaker 1>whenever someone says fracking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

282
00:13:16.231 --> 00:13:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I think of Battlestar Galactica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I think of,</v>

283
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

284
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Burns slant oil drilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see that simpsons when he,</v>

285
00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:25.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the slant oil drilling too,</v>

286
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:26.363
<v Speaker 1>because he creates a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an oil refinery over here and it's </v>

287
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:29.274
<v Speaker 1>slanted so that he can do things and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends up going under at school and all </v>

288
00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:32.580
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the who shot Mr.</v>

289
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Burns episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

290
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

291
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.050
<v Speaker 2>There's another one after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just news.</v>

292
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

293
00:13:36.401 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 1>So they did go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

294
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:38.074
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you couldn't be happy with that </v>

295
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:39.514
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably really don't like Lisa </v>

296
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.613
<v Speaker 1>Symptom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say yes.</v>

297
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.970
<v Speaker 2>She's probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already know the simpsons came out.</v>

298
00:13:43.971 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 2>I was the exact same age as bark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

299
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm born in 1980 and it came out in 89 </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was nine and I was nine.</v>

300
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.720
<v Speaker 2>And since I've outgrown him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least I never,</v>

301
00:13:53.721 --> 00:13:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I never liked even even when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal kind of politically as a kid.</v>

302
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never forget Mr.</v>

303
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Burns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about those two words?</v>

304
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.530
<v Speaker 2>But he was never likable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very funny.</v>

305
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not forward the three eyed </v>

306
00:14:04.971 --> 00:14:05.870
<v Speaker 2>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd say.</v>

307
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

308
00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:08.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's a whole interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>distortion,</v>

309
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:11.370
<v Speaker 2>which I think reveals that the modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

310
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.850
<v Speaker 2>what they call the environmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>

311
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.240
<v Speaker 2>which I would call the anti human or </v>
<v Speaker 2>regressive movement,</v>

312
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.920
<v Speaker 2>is really an equal opportunity destroyer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and attack of every practice practo form</v>

313
00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:21.754
<v Speaker 2>of energy because there is no manmade co</v>
<v Speaker 2>two issue with nuclear and yet they </v>

314
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:25.504
<v Speaker 2>viciously attack it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think just shows that they'll </v>

315
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 2>find a reason to attack any form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy that actually works,</v>

316
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:31.174
<v Speaker 2>but right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

317
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:32.031
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

318
00:14:32.031 --> 00:14:33.620
<v Speaker 1>So let's pause on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fracking,</v>

319
00:14:33.621 --> 00:14:34.454
<v Speaker 1>so I feel like people have no idea what </v>
<v Speaker 1>fracking is and I did obviously some </v>

320
00:14:37.581 --> 00:14:39.590
<v Speaker 1>research before I sat down with you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

321
00:14:39.591 --> 00:14:40.424
<v Speaker 1>you see all these videos of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning on water and water burst into </v>

322
00:14:42.321 --> 00:14:44.060
<v Speaker 1>flames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally that's,</v>

323
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I would think that that's not so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sell me on fracking.</v>

324
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.103
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that kind of like a funny way of </v>

325
00:14:50.721 --> 00:14:51.554
<v Speaker 2>approaching like there are some pictures</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people in the water bursting on </v>

326
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 2>plans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an odd thing.</v>

327
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Water racking into supplier is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

328
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:01.970
<v Speaker 2>this kind of goes with the issue of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear climate change,</v>

329
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:02.804
<v Speaker 2>you just sort of asked the scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they think with everything we need </v>

330
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:08.450
<v Speaker 2>to look at at the full context of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>

331
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:09.284
<v Speaker 2>both Kay and very carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both at its potential positives and its </v>

332
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:12.974
<v Speaker 2>potential negatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if someone could show me that </v>

333
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:19.010
<v Speaker 2>fracking is leading to a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's faucets on water,</v>

334
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 2>which is completely bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

335
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if that were true,</v>

336
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I would want to know the whole context </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what's the benefit of this.</v>

337
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:25.574
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil and gas or the two fundamentals are </v>

338
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:30.890
<v Speaker 2>two of three fundamentals of modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture.</v>

339
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil is the only thing that powers modern</v>

340
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.470
<v Speaker 2>agricultural machinery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily the form of diesel.</v>

341
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.543
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just no fuel that has that kind </v>

342
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:39.614
<v Speaker 2>of versatility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of portability and natural </v>

343
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:42.050
<v Speaker 2>gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

344
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.883
<v Speaker 2>makes modern fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So billions of people's lives depend on </v>

345
00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:46.214
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fracking or more accurately shale </v>

346
00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:48.764
<v Speaker 2>energy technology that's enabling </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of people to live who would </v>

347
00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:54.110
<v Speaker 2>otherwise starve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in my moral philosophy,</v>

348
00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I take that into account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I think of something,</v>

349
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:57.614
<v Speaker 2>I don't just look for the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the principle is we need to look at </v>

350
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 2>the full context and often attackers </v>
<v Speaker 2>just look at the negative context.</v>

351
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Now you do need to look at the negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the context.</v>

352
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.170
<v Speaker 2>And when you investigate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what you just find,</v>

353
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:10.004
<v Speaker 2>which anyone who studies water knows is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the number one contaminant of </v>

354
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:15.440
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including with methane,</v>

355
00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Speaker 2>which is natural gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is mother nature.</v>

356
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.280
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the US Geological </v>
<v Speaker 2>Survey,</v>

357
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:24.281
<v Speaker 2>something like 20% of just regular water</v>
<v Speaker 2>wells are naturally contaminated.</v>

358
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:25.154
<v Speaker 2>So this is why for for centuries you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have records of people lighting their </v>

359
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:28.994
<v Speaker 2>water on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one thing that gasoline brought to </v>

360
00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:34.340
<v Speaker 2>the fore is because Josh Fox was against</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural gas,</v>

361
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.653
<v Speaker 2>and that that brought a premium to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone who could show natural gas in </v>

362
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:39.734
<v Speaker 2>their water and blame it on fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that there was </v>

363
00:16:42.741 --> 00:16:43.401
<v Speaker 2>causation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

364
00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:44.234
<v Speaker 2>theoretically there could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very rare and it's very much a </v>

365
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:47.650
<v Speaker 2>solvable problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning,</v>

366
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.503
<v Speaker 2>if I turn on my water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right now in San Francisco and it </v>

367
00:16:50.151 --> 00:16:52.770
<v Speaker 2>like lights on fire and it's not like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the year,</v>

368
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.440
<v Speaker 2>it's not even a lights on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

369
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.110
<v Speaker 2>If I strike a match to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it lights on fire.</v>

370
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that flame is coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the farm,</v>

371
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.983
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

372
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.670
<v Speaker 2>the building burned down or there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing like this.</v>

373
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.340
<v Speaker 2>So you have to have a very proactive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

374
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.583
<v Speaker 2>attitude where you want the technologies</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be as good as possible in one </v>

375
00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:13.514
<v Speaker 2>conspicuous attribute of the anti humans</v>
<v Speaker 2>is they always want the technologies </v>

376
00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:18.530
<v Speaker 2>there against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be bad like that,</v>

377
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:23.531
<v Speaker 2>you really feel viscerally that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want a catastrophic climate change to be</v>

378
00:17:23.601 --> 00:17:23.911
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

379
00:17:23.911 --> 00:17:26.690
<v Speaker 2>and I ask this question on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody has ever contradicted me.</v>

380
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.673
<v Speaker 2>How many catastrophists do you know who </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be happy if they found out they </v>

381
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:32.150
<v Speaker 2>were wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're gleeful.</v>

382
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:32.984
<v Speaker 2>Every storm and every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every bad weather event that they </v>

383
00:17:34.671 --> 00:17:37.820
<v Speaker 2>attribute to co2 and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suv and that kind of thing.</v>

384
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.060
<v Speaker 2>There's a real glee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I would,</v>

385
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.380
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes I'll tell them like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter fact,</v>

386
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:42.651
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

387
00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:43.484
<v Speaker 2>you know that actually the rate of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people dying from climate is going way </v>

388
00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:47.180
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're actually way safer.</v>

389
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.470
<v Speaker 2>And they immediately scream at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

390
00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't you be happy at this?</v>

391
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 2>That there's a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not happy people in general,</v>

392
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.550
<v Speaker 2>but they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not happy about the potential of</v>

393
00:17:56.551 --> 00:17:57.384
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>

394
00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.530
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a lot there.</v>

395
00:17:59.531 --> 00:18:00.310
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

396
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.150
<v Speaker 1>let's pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

397
00:18:01.151 --> 00:18:04.750
<v Speaker 1>how did you get involved in this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I can see how passionate it is for</v>

398
00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:05.584
<v Speaker 1>you and obviously you've staked out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position that is not politically </v>

399
00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:11.050
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when you go to this rally in New</v>

400
00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:11.411
<v Speaker 1>York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

401
00:18:11.411 --> 00:18:14.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not fun being yelled at people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>told you're evil and you're a sick.</v>

402
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.360
<v Speaker 1>People were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry said he's a sell out,</v>

403
00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:17.770
<v Speaker 1>they don't know anything about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

404
00:18:17.771 --> 00:18:21.280
<v Speaker 1>So how did you even get involved and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in this in the first place?</v>

405
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

406
00:18:22.251 --> 00:18:26.540
<v Speaker 2>being full and a queen popular I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a pretty poor goal to have.</v>

407
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

408
00:18:27.651 --> 00:18:28.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really,</v>

409
00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:29.774
<v Speaker 2>so my background was I was like a total </v>
<v Speaker 2>math science kid until I was 14 or 15 </v>

410
00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:36.410
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no interest in politics,</v>

411
00:18:36.411 --> 00:18:37.244
<v Speaker 2>no interest in writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought those people were the biggest </v>

412
00:18:38.511 --> 00:18:39.344
<v Speaker 2>losers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what I do in terms of primarily </v>

413
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:43.550
<v Speaker 2>being a philosopher and talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like as a kid,</v>

414
00:18:43.551 --> 00:18:44.384
<v Speaker 2>I thought there was no worst thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do with your life if you were </v>

415
00:18:47.181 --> 00:18:48.014
<v Speaker 2>to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you had to do was you had to be an </v>

416
00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:50.900
<v Speaker 2>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a businessman,</v>

417
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.650
<v Speaker 2>or like a scientist slash engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was 14 years old,</v>

418
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.870
<v Speaker 2>like kind of the peak of my scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

419
00:18:56.871 --> 00:19:00.230
<v Speaker 2>I won the national nat a Mars rover </v>
<v Speaker 2>design contest.</v>

420
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.090
<v Speaker 2>And so that was totally my direction.</v>

421
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.923
<v Speaker 2>I remember having a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some friends and they were arguing </v>

422
00:19:04.851 --> 00:19:05.930
<v Speaker 2>liberal and conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

423
00:19:05.931 --> 00:19:06.890
<v Speaker 2>what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

424
00:19:06.891 --> 00:19:08.510
<v Speaker 2>what's the liberal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a conservative?</v>

425
00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:10.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which most people at 14 know that,</v>

426
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.203
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they started making fun of me and I </v>

427
00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:12.470
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

428
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of all you idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yelling at each other and nothing.</v>

429
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:16.363
<v Speaker 2>I hated it because it was so illogical </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people were just yelling and there </v>

430
00:19:18.591 --> 00:19:19.640
<v Speaker 2>was no common ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

431
00:19:19.641 --> 00:19:21.740
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to think logically about this,</v>

432
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.903
<v Speaker 2>just like I do a bad engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sort of since then I've just been </v>

433
00:19:25.491 --> 00:19:26.324
<v Speaker 2>fascinated with the question of what are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental things that actually </v>

434
00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:33.260
<v Speaker 2>lead human beings to success?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are what I call now the fundamental</v>

435
00:19:33.261 --> 00:19:34.094
<v Speaker 2>principles of human progress?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went through being a liberal </v>

436
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.450
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a libertarian,</v>

437
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.463
<v Speaker 2>and as you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovering Ayn rand when I was 18 we </v>

438
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.103
<v Speaker 2>had a really big impact on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really cared about that issue and </v>

439
00:19:45.201 --> 00:19:46.034
<v Speaker 2>it really bothered me that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't have intelligent discussions </v>

440
00:19:48.801 --> 00:19:51.410
<v Speaker 2>and that there was no common a frame of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reference.</v>

441
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:52.243
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of my career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really all my career has been a trying </v>

442
00:19:54.141 --> 00:19:56.540
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what needs to progress and</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

443
00:19:56.541 --> 00:20:00.620
<v Speaker 2>how to persuade other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I see the anti human movement,</v>

444
00:20:00.621 --> 00:20:01.454
<v Speaker 2>as I call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that movement contradicts every </v>

445
00:20:03.621 --> 00:20:04.454
<v Speaker 2>fundamental principle of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it contradicts human </v>

446
00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.004
<v Speaker 2>flourishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it contradicts individual </v>

447
00:20:08.271 --> 00:20:09.104
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it contradicts critical </v>

448
00:20:10.071 --> 00:20:10.904
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it contradicts our nature as </v>

449
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.670
<v Speaker 2>transformers of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I really hate it and I hated it since</v>

450
00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:17.504
<v Speaker 2>I was 18 and I've loved ability and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I only got into energy like nine </v>

451
00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:22.041
<v Speaker 2>years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

452
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I really oppose the anti human movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

453
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.330
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about fossil fuels,</v>

454
00:20:26.331 --> 00:20:28.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's about every form of making life</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

455
00:20:28.671 --> 00:20:29.504
<v Speaker 2>And I think fossil fuels is one of many </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that's really good that the </v>

456
00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Greens have misrepresented as poison us.</v>

457
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll get to the Greens in a second.</v>

458
00:20:36.121 --> 00:20:36.790
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

459
00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I'd imagine that a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people watching this are going to say,</v>

460
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:41.220
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's into fossil fuels.</v>

461
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Andy's into iron rand and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

462
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:44.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm red.</v>

463
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.860
<v Speaker 1>It was somehow selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's when I,</v>

464
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:47.723
<v Speaker 1>when I've talked to your own Brooke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to mark Pellegrino and a </v>

465
00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:52.460
<v Speaker 1>few other people that that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the main critique that it,</v>

466
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a selfishness to this.</v>

467
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:57.760
<v Speaker 1>And when I had John Fugelsang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a bar lefty on,</v>

468
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he was attacking.</v>

469
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.300
<v Speaker 1>You got him on the week after I had your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own and it was like we did one and then,</v>

470
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.400
<v Speaker 1>and then we did the complete opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they're good.</v>

471
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 1>They will try to link the objectivism </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea to,</v>

472
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.503
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just want to use everything now </v>

473
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 1>while you can and you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave anything for anyone else.</v>

474
00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm pretty sure you're going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case,</v>

475
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

476
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.513
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave it there.</v>

477
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.893
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be surprised if they made that </v>

478
00:21:21.411 --> 00:21:24.500
<v Speaker 2>connection from what I've said so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

479
00:21:24.501 --> 00:21:28.460
<v Speaker 2>so what I've said so far is related time</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran in terms of thinking about things in</v>

480
00:21:28.461 --> 00:21:29.294
<v Speaker 2>the full context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a very important </v>

481
00:21:30.471 --> 00:21:33.200
<v Speaker 2>principle and certainly one that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned a lot about,</v>

482
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from her,</v>

483
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.413
<v Speaker 2>but that that should go toward this idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being integrated in our thinking and </v>

484
00:21:39.351 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 2>long range about our thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

485
00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I can't take anything I said so far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>short range,</v>

486
00:21:44.331 --> 00:21:46.220
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

487
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.473
<v Speaker 2>what does selfish mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is another issue where we need </v>

488
00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:50.990
<v Speaker 2>clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that to me is selfish.</v>

489
00:21:50.991 --> 00:21:54.830
<v Speaker 2>Means that I act from my own interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the proper interpretation of</v>

490
00:21:54.831 --> 00:21:55.664
<v Speaker 2>the moral interpretation of that is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that in harmony with everyone else </v>

491
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.220
<v Speaker 2>doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even if I didn't,</v>

492
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:02.443
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the climate is actually just ruining </v>

493
00:22:04.221 --> 00:22:07.300
<v Speaker 2>everyone's life right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not selfish about itself.</v>

494
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.283
<v Speaker 2>So there's this idea of the harmony of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human interests and that would apply </v>

495
00:22:11.031 --> 00:22:11.864
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why we need to explore </v>

496
00:22:12.651 --> 00:22:16.730
<v Speaker 2>something like co2 because if c two is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really making the world into an inferno,</v>

497
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're an ego,</v>

498
00:22:18.291 --> 00:22:19.280
<v Speaker 2>esther,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an altruist,</v>

499
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.250
<v Speaker 2>lots of people are going to get hurt.</v>

500
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:22.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the record,</v>

501
00:22:22.991 --> 00:22:26.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe the premise that I left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that that's a lot.</v>

502
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.230
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the critiques that I hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot because I know that if you,</v>

503
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.570
<v Speaker 1>if you live in a way that's for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

504
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 1>we'll living a good life for yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>means not destroying the environment.</v>

505
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause you have to live in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

506
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:36.514
<v Speaker 1>It means helping other people in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>community because you've got to live </v>

507
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:40.690
<v Speaker 1>with these other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't view that as selfish.</v>

508
00:22:40.691 --> 00:22:43.000
<v Speaker 1>But I know that that's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the critiques.</v>

509
00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I wanted to throw it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope hopefully.</v>

510
00:22:45.881 --> 00:22:47.110
<v Speaker 1>But we'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

511
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.083
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically you're saying that we have </v>

512
00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:52.720
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's here,</v>

513
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.583
<v Speaker 1>it is not only good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has created more good then then </v>

514
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.850
<v Speaker 1>pretty much anything else that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last 300 years we have more,</v>

515
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public health.</v>

516
00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:03.124
<v Speaker 1>We have more ability to do things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed societies and that there's </v>

517
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 1>just nothing to compare to that is that</v>

518
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important though that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily a future looking perspective.</v>

519
00:23:13.791 --> 00:23:14.624
<v Speaker 2>So I hear both the opponents and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporters of fossil fuels often talk </v>

520
00:23:17.991 --> 00:23:19.220
<v Speaker 2>about this as if this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

521
00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.580
<v Speaker 2>this is an issue in the past where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a history lesson,</v>

522
00:23:22.581 --> 00:23:22.871
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

523
00:23:22.871 --> 00:23:23.451
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

524
00:23:23.451 --> 00:23:26.930
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuel is brought us here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore we have to use them.</v>

525
00:23:26.931 --> 00:23:29.390
<v Speaker 2>And then the opponents say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I say Epstein,</v>

526
00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.373
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just showing that fossil fuels </v>

527
00:23:30.981 --> 00:23:33.060
<v Speaker 2>were useful in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not useful in the president.</v>

528
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I think if people read my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not at all true,</v>

529
00:23:35.691 --> 00:23:36.524
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to understand the past </v>

530
00:23:37.641 --> 00:23:39.770
<v Speaker 2>history of energy for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

531
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.073
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one which I talked about in chapter one </v>

532
00:23:42.081 --> 00:23:42.914
<v Speaker 2>of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secret history of fossil fuels is </v>

533
00:23:43.911 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 2>that all the catastrophist made today </v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually very old predictions.</v>

534
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>There are several decades old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have been tested,</v>

535
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.770
<v Speaker 2>they've failed.</v>

536
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 2>And so we have a lot of material for </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis.</v>

537
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.393
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even more important in terms of </v>

538
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:57.463
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we look at the relationship between </v>

539
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.400
<v Speaker 2>energy use and every aspect of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

540
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.340
<v Speaker 2>we see this very dramatic positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlation.</v>

541
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 2>And what that points to is what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy?</v>

542
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:08.990
<v Speaker 2>So I mentioned I am and why it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

543
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:09.681
<v Speaker 2>So I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

544
00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:12.260
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuels as a potential source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>

545
00:24:12.261 --> 00:24:14.640
<v Speaker 2>this high energy hydrocarbon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

546
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 2>but the fundamental behind that is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>is energy?</v>

547
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.050
<v Speaker 2>So energy is really our ability to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines to improve our lives.</v>

548
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:24.080
<v Speaker 2>And what we see is the more access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have,</v>

549
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.780
<v Speaker 2>the better we can make everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

550
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

551
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go to a lot of trouble,</v>

552
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to show that.</v>

553
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:32.091
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:32.924
<v Speaker 2>from agriculture I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I literally say the oil industry </v>

555
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:37.610
<v Speaker 2>solve world hunger and people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a joke.</v>

556
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:38.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's really true</v>

557
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.700
<v Speaker 1>because basically we could far more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>create more for more people.</v>

558
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Basically you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

559
00:24:44.251 --> 00:24:46.440
<v Speaker 2>you and I as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might work out,</v>

560
00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:47.880
<v Speaker 2>but we're very weak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

561
00:24:47.881 --> 00:24:49.650
<v Speaker 2>We can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not superman right now.</v>

562
00:24:49.651 --> 00:24:50.484
<v Speaker 2>If we had superman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't need oil because superman </v>

563
00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:56.280
<v Speaker 2>has real skill is not reg rescuing Lois </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lane has real skill.</v>

564
00:24:56.281 --> 00:24:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Is Industrialization right off I had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>superman.</v>

565
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.730
<v Speaker 2>I would just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

566
00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:02.070
<v Speaker 2>get all the ore out of the minds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

567
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.570
<v Speaker 1>that's his who super power is power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the record.</v>

568
00:25:04.571 --> 00:25:05.404
<v Speaker 1>I just watched that Batman Superman </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and I don't even know what his </v>

569
00:25:06.851 --> 00:25:08.890
<v Speaker 1>skill is at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing was such a freaking mess.</v>

570
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a total sidebar,</v>

571
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.460
<v Speaker 1>but I okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

572
00:25:14.461 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to get dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you.</v>

573
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.740
<v Speaker 1>You want to work on an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

574
00:25:17.741 --> 00:25:20.620
<v Speaker 1>If you need like three hours of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbing your brain,</v>

575
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.300
<v Speaker 2>that's your mind fly a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my usual remedy is to watch the,</v>

576
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:25.920
<v Speaker 2>cause I have this temptation to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the theater.</v>

577
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:26.763
<v Speaker 2>So I just say I'll wait three months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll watch the first five minutes and </v>

578
00:25:28.231 --> 00:25:29.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll never,</v>

579
00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.460
<v Speaker 2>I'll never have to deal with it but put </v>
<v Speaker 2>money on it.</v>

580
00:25:32.461 --> 00:25:32.940
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

581
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.290
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have anyway,</v>

582
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:38.640
<v Speaker 2>like basically what oil allows us to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to be like superman.</v>

583
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.760
<v Speaker 2>We can multiply or any form of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we can multiply our,</v>

584
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.160
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of energy,</v>

585
00:25:44.161 --> 00:25:47.370
<v Speaker 2>the amount of power we have by a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>times or more,</v>

586
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.353
<v Speaker 2>and that enables 1% of us to be farmers </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of nearly a hundred percent in </v>

587
00:25:53.701 --> 00:25:55.380
<v Speaker 2>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just this amazing thing.</v>

588
00:25:55.381 --> 00:25:56.214
<v Speaker 2>But one other example that just to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>you the breadth of it is medical </v>

589
00:25:59.401 --> 00:26:00.600
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because often I'll say,</v>

590
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:05.400
<v Speaker 2>we'll get look at these insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlations between energy use and life</v>

591
00:26:05.401 --> 00:26:05.970
<v Speaker 2>expectancy.</v>

592
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:06.541
<v Speaker 2>And they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

593
00:26:06.541 --> 00:26:09.300
<v Speaker 2>that has nothing to do with energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just medical research.</v>

594
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.440
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

595
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.380
<v Speaker 2>how did those researchers get time to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that research?</v>

596
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Because he certainly didn't mean any </v>
<v Speaker 2>time when they're on the farm.</v>

597
00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:20.970
<v Speaker 2>So basically the more physical labor we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do through machines,</v>

598
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.340
<v Speaker 2>the more time we can spend doing mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>labor,</v>

599
00:26:23.341 --> 00:26:25.680
<v Speaker 2>including both of us have mental labor </v>
<v Speaker 2>careers,</v>

600
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:26.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

601
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.480
<v Speaker 2>So we need to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

602
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.700
<v Speaker 2>we need to be very appreciative of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of energy.</v>

603
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.650
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to go back to your question,</v>

604
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:32.603
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying about fossil fuels is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not merely they were a good source of </v>

605
00:26:35.491 --> 00:26:36.324
<v Speaker 2>energy and we should sort of be grateful</v>
<v Speaker 2>and give them a gold watch or something </v>

606
00:26:39.091 --> 00:26:40.320
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is,</v>

607
00:26:40.321 --> 00:26:45.150
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the ways of generating </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy by the standard of what's cheap,</v>

608
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.740
<v Speaker 2>plentiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable,</v>

609
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:47.574
<v Speaker 2>and scalable to billions of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no industry comes close to what the </v>

610
00:26:51.331 --> 00:26:53.000
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuel industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

611
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:53.993
<v Speaker 2>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in terms of our moral </v>

612
00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 2>calculations for what we want to do over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next several decades,</v>

613
00:26:58.201 --> 00:26:59.034
<v Speaker 2>that has to be factored into the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture along with these potential </v>

614
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:03.300
<v Speaker 2>negatives that we can talk about it.</v>

615
00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.173
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm guessing that some people would </v>

616
00:27:05.021 --> 00:27:06.220
<v Speaker 1>hear that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

617
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.740
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I take all of that as crew,</v>

618
00:27:08.741 --> 00:27:10.330
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

619
00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.620
<v Speaker 1>if there is some risk related to co two </v>
<v Speaker 1>emissions and uh,</v>

620
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:16.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greenhouse effect and all that stuff,</v>

621
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 1>why not just at this moment just start a</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive transition to green?</v>

622
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can talk about green but,</v>

623
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.333
<v Speaker 2>but you might make the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a stronger argument if it </v>

624
00:27:27.611 --> 00:27:28.444
<v Speaker 2>were alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we can talk about why the </v>

625
00:27:30.311 --> 00:27:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Greens are anti-nuclear an anti hydro </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydro,</v>

626
00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:35.020
<v Speaker 2>which are the only decent non </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] two.</v>

627
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.561
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

628
00:27:35.561 --> 00:27:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's do that then.</v>

629
00:27:36.641 --> 00:27:40.180
<v Speaker 1>So they'd hear what you said that okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll I buy all of that.</v>

630
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.043
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means said if it's still putting </v>

631
00:27:42.581 --> 00:27:43.414
<v Speaker 1>out some bad stuff into the atmosphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not sure what exactly what </v>

632
00:27:46.061 --> 00:27:46.894
<v Speaker 1>that's going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if we cut our emissions in the </v>

633
00:27:48.611 --> 00:27:51.460
<v Speaker 1>United States that India and China are </v>
<v Speaker 1>still going through what we went through</v>

634
00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:55.300
<v Speaker 1>50 years ago and they're going to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of this about why not just make that</v>

635
00:27:55.301 --> 00:27:56.470
<v Speaker 1>transition anyway.</v>

636
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.133
<v Speaker 2>So this is a couple of issues here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one is his thinking in the full </v>

637
00:27:59.781 --> 00:28:02.450
<v Speaker 2>context means being really clear about </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude.</v>

638
00:28:02.451 --> 00:28:03.284
<v Speaker 2>So one is what is the magnitude of </v>
<v Speaker 2>superiority of what the fossil fuel </v>

639
00:28:06.231 --> 00:28:07.064
<v Speaker 2>industry is doing versus the others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what is the magnitude of the </v>

640
00:28:09.501 --> 00:28:11.300
<v Speaker 2>downsides?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say hypothetically,</v>

641
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.120
<v Speaker 2>so Al Gore gave the speech in 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Al Gore,</v>

642
00:28:14.121 --> 00:28:14.650
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

643
00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.520
<v Speaker 2>my uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite person here.</v>

644
00:28:16.521 --> 00:28:17.061
<v Speaker 2>Your buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

645
00:28:17.061 --> 00:28:18.550
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go ahead with my buddy,</v>

646
00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.453
<v Speaker 2>but he said we should outlaw by the year</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 all what he calls a non renewable </v>

647
00:28:24.081 --> 00:28:26.660
<v Speaker 2>sources of power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically he wanted solar,</v>

648
00:28:26.661 --> 00:28:30.140
<v Speaker 2>wind and some geothermal and he claimed </v>
<v Speaker 2>we could do this in he clammed.</v>

649
00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:30.974
<v Speaker 2>I know of renewable sources that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>generate energy for the equivalent of </v>

650
00:28:33.591 --> 00:28:37.130
<v Speaker 2>less than a dollar a gallon of gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I've asked what this is.</v>

651
00:28:37.131 --> 00:28:37.964
<v Speaker 2>He still has not named this source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was willing to outlaw all of </v>

652
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.230
<v Speaker 2>American energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

653
00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:43.243
<v Speaker 2>In order to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and at the same time he would claim </v>

654
00:28:45.171 --> 00:28:48.260
<v Speaker 2>that we're decades away from 20 foot sea</v>
<v Speaker 2>level rises,</v>

655
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.240
<v Speaker 2>which would be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very negative thing.</v>

656
00:28:50.241 --> 00:28:50.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

657
00:28:50.751 --> 00:28:51.584
<v Speaker 2>very hard to justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of a one scenario of </v>

658
00:28:53.541 --> 00:28:58.541
<v Speaker 2>magnitudes where fossil fuel industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually has no magnitude of superiority</v>

659
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
<v Speaker 2>in terms of generating energy and it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>an incredible damage,</v>

660
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And incredible downside.</v>

661
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.553
<v Speaker 2>But what if it was true that say we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>a minor amount of warming and that the </v>

662
00:29:11.061 --> 00:29:15.530
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuel industry was just way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way it was generations ahead of everyone</v>

663
00:29:15.531 --> 00:29:17.480
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of transition,</v>

664
00:29:17.481 --> 00:29:18.314
<v Speaker 2>I think the implication would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is implication no </v>

665
00:29:20.031 --> 00:29:22.910
<v Speaker 2>matter what is that you would want a </v>
<v Speaker 2>free market,</v>

666
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.133
<v Speaker 2>a transition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd want to look at what are other </v>

667
00:29:26.811 --> 00:29:30.800
<v Speaker 2>technologies and are there any things we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do to liberate them.</v>

668
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.633
<v Speaker 2>And I think the number one thing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could observe is that the </v>

669
00:29:33.741 --> 00:29:34.574
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist since the 70s have made</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear power drastically more </v>

670
00:29:37.161 --> 00:29:39.050
<v Speaker 2>expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many times more expensive.</v>

671
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.820
<v Speaker 2>So instead of the cost going down time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the natural progression,</v>

672
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:46.570
<v Speaker 2>as human ingenuity is applied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cost has gone up many fold.</v>

673
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Even though nuclear is provably the </v>
<v Speaker 2>safest form of power ever.</v>

674
00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

675
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's pause there for a sec.</v>

676
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:55.450
<v Speaker 2>So they made the cost go up because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>force what you would,</v>

677
00:29:55.451 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I think argue are unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations essentially.</v>

678
00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with everything in life you have to do,</v>

679
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:01.983
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a certain threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically their threshold of safety </v>

680
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.243
<v Speaker 2>is what they would call infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say nuclear is a hundred times </v>

681
00:30:09.131 --> 00:30:11.410
<v Speaker 2>safer than any form of power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact numbers,</v>

682
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:13.060
<v Speaker 2>but that's not implausible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

683
00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.590
<v Speaker 2>They'll say basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

684
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:16.540
<v Speaker 2>it has to be a million times safer.</v>

685
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.493
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

686
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a certain point you can make anything</v>

687
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:22.390
<v Speaker 2>infinitely expensive by having an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unlimited number of employees,</v>

688
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlimited amount of containment or an </v>

689
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:25.474
<v Speaker 2>unlimited amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is perhaps the most damaging </v>

690
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a nuclear reactor.</v>

691
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:30.850
<v Speaker 2>It used to be able to build these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a couple of years.</v>

692
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:31.983
<v Speaker 2>Now you can basically not build them </v>
<v Speaker 2>your chances of building them or </v>

693
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 2>certainly less than one half and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes over 20 years.</v>

694
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.673
<v Speaker 2>So that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in effect they've co because of </v>

695
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:43.270
<v Speaker 2>the regulations that they've helped push</v>
<v Speaker 2>through through governments,</v>

696
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:44.403
<v Speaker 2>they've called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've forced the price to go up </v>

697
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:47.440
<v Speaker 2>because you need more people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need more research,</v>

698
00:30:47.441 --> 00:30:49.790
<v Speaker 2>you need more capital or capital and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>

699
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.060
<v Speaker 2>If you just think about like if somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

700
00:30:52.061 --> 00:30:53.170
<v Speaker 2>hey dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

701
00:30:53.171 --> 00:30:54.004
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed some money and like you just </v>

702
00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:56.110
<v Speaker 2>came into all this money through </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriot,</v>

703
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:56.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

704
00:30:56.491 --> 00:30:58.060
<v Speaker 2>you're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really successful now.</v>

705
00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Like help us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help us,</v>

706
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.990
<v Speaker 2>help us find an answer that had to land </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

707
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.980
<v Speaker 2>At minimum it's going to be ready in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

708
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.460
<v Speaker 2>but it may never be approved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to,</v>

709
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:10.930
<v Speaker 2>are you going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

710
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:11.764
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you want to touch that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens is because of </v>

711
00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:15.724
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to get subsidies and special </v>

712
00:31:17.051 --> 00:31:18.820
<v Speaker 2>loans and then the green say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seat,</v>

713
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:19.961
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

714
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:21.820
<v Speaker 2>you can't compete on the free market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

715
00:31:21.821 --> 00:31:22.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bashing.</v>

716
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:24.640
<v Speaker 2>And Michael Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Tonya harding approach,</v>

717
00:31:24.641 --> 00:31:26.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Nancy Kerry.</v>

718
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.520
<v Speaker 2>See Nancy Kerrigan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

719
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.920
<v Speaker 2>you can't compete on the free skating </v>
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

720
00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:30.754
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not allowed to bash the </v>

721
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.063
<v Speaker 2>person's leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my point is that a real alternative </v>

722
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:38.830
<v Speaker 2>energy policy is just a free market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what you get.</v>

723
00:31:38.831 --> 00:31:41.980
<v Speaker 2>And you had much more of that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies then you do today.</v>

724
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.230
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's very revealing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not for that,</v>

725
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:45.064
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my own evaluation of the negatives </v>

726
00:31:46.661 --> 00:31:48.280
<v Speaker 2>of fossil fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly with CO2,</v>

727
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.290
<v Speaker 2>is that they're much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much less than people think.</v>

728
00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:54.250
<v Speaker 2>And therefore I think it's a good thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're continuing to expand it.</v>

729
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 2>And I think it'd be very good if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could continue to expand other things.</v>

730
00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.530
<v Speaker 2>But whatever's competitive on the free </v>
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>

731
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:03.040
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't force people to use junk </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that just increases the price.</v>

732
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:05.620
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting things,</v>

733
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:06.454
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think they're generally the </v>

734
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.670
<v Speaker 2>opposite of green energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you raised before.</v>

735
00:32:09.671 --> 00:32:10.504
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a question of why are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greens obsessed with what I call the </v>

736
00:32:12.971 --> 00:32:14.710
<v Speaker 2>unreliables with solar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Wind,</v>

737
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.693
<v Speaker 2>they can't reliably produce electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that their number one focus </v>

738
00:32:18.881 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 2>instead of nuclear and hydro?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think anyone who's sympathetic to them</v>

739
00:32:22.391 --> 00:32:26.410
<v Speaker 2>needs to ask that and really ask is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue co2 or is it something else?</v>

740
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the nuclear front,</v>

741
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you say the threshold?</v>

742
00:32:31.121 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>

743
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 2>what happened in Japan about what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>about four years ago now,</v>

744
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.183
<v Speaker 2>and they've been saying that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactor has been leaking into the </v>

745
00:32:37.721 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Pacific and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear people say,</v>

746
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

747
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.813
<v Speaker 1>now this stuff is eventually going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make its way over to the west coast of </v>

748
00:32:43.971 --> 00:32:46.010
<v Speaker 1>the United States and radiation and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

749
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Would you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

750
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first off,</v>

751
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.120
<v Speaker 1>do you agree that that is true?</v>

752
00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all a threshold issue.</v>

753
00:32:52.691 --> 00:32:53.524
<v Speaker 2>So the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this idea that no amount of </v>

754
00:32:55.661 --> 00:32:56.494
<v Speaker 2>radiation is safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're experiencing radiation right </v>

755
00:32:59.111 --> 00:32:59.944
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting some from the potassium </v>

756
00:33:01.031 --> 00:33:03.290
<v Speaker 2>inside your body right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

757
00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.870
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get,</v>

758
00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you'll get more radiation if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

759
00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how off color people can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

760
00:33:09.041 --> 00:33:10.300
<v Speaker 2>but the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best go,</v>

761
00:33:10.301 --> 00:33:11.134
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go the best nuclear line ever from </v>

762
00:33:12.941 --> 00:33:13.774
<v Speaker 2>Edward Teller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just a Edward Teller was this </v>

763
00:33:14.981 --> 00:33:18.670
<v Speaker 2>brilliant physicist who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who helped invent the h bomb and he,</v>

764
00:33:18.671 --> 00:33:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think never got a Nobel prize </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was extremely anticommunist.</v>

765
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.031
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

766
00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:23.864
<v Speaker 2>he had this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to explain to people that </v>

767
00:33:25.241 --> 00:33:26.770
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be afraid of a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>power plant.</v>

768
00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:28.960
<v Speaker 2>It basically said if you live right next</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a nuclear power plant,</v>

769
00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:33.220
<v Speaker 2>you get slightly more radiation than you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do by sleeping next to your wife.</v>

770
00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.840
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the lesson from this?</v>

771
00:33:34.841 --> 00:33:38.140
<v Speaker 2>We'll sleeping with one woman is safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sleeping with more than one is very,</v>

772
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:40.150
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

773
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.510
<v Speaker 2>but that is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what you like.</v>

774
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.940
<v Speaker 2>People have no concept that it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the threshold.</v>

775
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:46.893
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question would be is there anything </v>

776
00:33:49.451 --> 00:33:54.451
<v Speaker 2>resembling a dangerous threshold and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any deaths at all.</v>

777
00:33:55.061 --> 00:33:55.894
<v Speaker 2>You don't have radiation sickness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you do have is scares where people </v>

778
00:33:59.321 --> 00:34:02.650
<v Speaker 2>do die because of forced evacuation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this happened at three mile island as</v>

779
00:34:02.651 --> 00:34:03.760
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody died.</v>

780
00:34:03.761 --> 00:34:05.300
<v Speaker 2>There was no threat of death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

781
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:06.700
<v Speaker 2>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from radiation.</v>

782
00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:07.534
<v Speaker 2>But you have these elderly populations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have them scared and it's because </v>

783
00:34:10.391 --> 00:34:11.224
<v Speaker 2>there's this demonization and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big parallel between the </v>

784
00:34:14.141 --> 00:34:18.970
<v Speaker 2>demonization of manmade CO2 and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonization of manmade radiation.</v>

785
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.833
<v Speaker 2>And what I would argue is that the anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>human movement demonizes everything man </v>

786
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:27.700
<v Speaker 2>made and we expect it to be bad even </v>
<v Speaker 2>before we investigate that.</v>

787
00:34:27.701 --> 00:34:28.534
<v Speaker 2>It's bad to expect any change of climate</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be bad before we truly investigate </v>

788
00:34:32.801 --> 00:34:33.390
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

789
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the anti human movement,</v>

790
00:34:35.461 --> 00:34:36.294
<v Speaker 1>I like that phrase in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just got very dystopian something </v>

791
00:34:39.151 --> 00:34:40.200
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

792
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.100
<v Speaker 1>So basically it seems to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these,</v>

793
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.213
<v Speaker 1>there's an element to these types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that think that everything's </v>

794
00:34:48.391 --> 00:34:49.620
<v Speaker 1>about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of,</v>

795
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.040
<v Speaker 1>that I think you may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think that they think that there's</v>

796
00:34:55.231 --> 00:34:56.064
<v Speaker 1>something sort of empowering in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think that we are controlling </v>

797
00:34:59.281 --> 00:35:00.114
<v Speaker 1>that through our actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're controlling the environment in a </v>

798
00:35:02.941 --> 00:35:04.200
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

799
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really focused on you.</v>

800
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:07.960
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That by,</v>

801
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:08.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in West Hollywood where we don't </v>

802
00:35:09.811 --> 00:35:12.330
<v Speaker 1>have plastic bags anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at trader Joe's,</v>

803
00:35:12.331 --> 00:35:14.280
<v Speaker 1>if I have to pay 10 cents for a paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>bag,</v>

804
00:35:14.281 --> 00:35:15.114
<v Speaker 1>which I usually do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they prefer that you bring your own </v>

805
00:35:16.801 --> 00:35:18.310
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always think like I,</v>

806
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:21.360
<v Speaker 1>it's nice that we're doing this and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to bring my bag when I can,</v>

807
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.510
<v Speaker 1>but like I always think it's more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just sort of doing this to sort of</v>

808
00:35:24.511 --> 00:35:28.500
<v Speaker 1>feel good about ourselves really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because no matter what we do here,</v>

809
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.110
<v Speaker 1>especially on that very local level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said before,</v>

810
00:35:31.111 --> 00:35:31.944
<v Speaker 1>China and India are going through their </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial revolution now they're going </v>

811
00:35:34.641 --> 00:35:36.030
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what we do,</v>

812
00:35:36.031 --> 00:35:36.864
<v Speaker 1>that makes us feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to keep doing all of that </v>

813
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some ways it's sort of just,</v>

814
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:41.843
<v Speaker 1>it's like a combination of sort of lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>of science and keeping things about </v>

815
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:47.640
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that,</v>

816
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.410
<v Speaker 1>did I get anywhere on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

817
00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.920
<v Speaker 2>cause this is often the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism,</v>

818
00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:57.280
<v Speaker 2>which I think is generally wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think so.</v>

819
00:35:57.281 --> 00:36:01.240
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more that I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more a hell narrative.</v>

820
00:36:01.241 --> 00:36:02.074
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of a hell and what causes you </v>

821
00:36:04.991 --> 00:36:05.824
<v Speaker 2>to go to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's much more of a parallel </v>

822
00:36:07.841 --> 00:36:10.210
<v Speaker 2>because if you think of like what causes</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to go to hell,</v>

823
00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you violate a certain commandment and </v>

824
00:36:12.431 --> 00:36:14.920
<v Speaker 2>the commandment isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily a scientific thing,</v>

825
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.870
<v Speaker 2>it's just that this is what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>commanded.</v>

826
00:36:16.871 --> 00:36:19.540
<v Speaker 2>And if you go against it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's going to be a negative</v>

827
00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:21.760
<v Speaker 1>causing my gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause earthquakes kind of thing.</v>

828
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you don't buy into,</v>

829
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I've ever heard it.</v>

830
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Well at least you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat Roberts,</v>

831
00:36:28.661 --> 00:36:30.040
<v Speaker 1>it'll get every time there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake,</v>

832
00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power of the [inaudible] fracking.</v>

833
00:36:33.041 --> 00:36:34.390
<v Speaker 1>So told us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

834
00:36:34.391 --> 00:36:36.820
<v Speaker 1>now this is defragging instead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deans out,</v>

835
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.260
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically plausible causal relation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you imagine a gay fracking,</v>

836
00:36:41.261 --> 00:36:43.570
<v Speaker 1>then he'd really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't actually,</v>

837
00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.030
<v Speaker 1>that would be something I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

838
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

839
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:48.990
<v Speaker 2>so what we're going to this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the idea that,</v>

840
00:36:48.991 --> 00:36:49.920
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

841
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.890
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's somehow a view of it's all,</v>

842
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.720
<v Speaker 2>it's all about us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so let's,</v>

843
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:57.810
<v Speaker 2>let's look at it from a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction if you will.</v>

844
00:36:57.811 --> 00:37:02.811
<v Speaker 2>Get Industrialization is all about us in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sense of we are taking a planet.</v>

845
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 2>And what we're saying about the planet </v>
<v Speaker 2>is this planet is imperfect.</v>

846
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not nearly safe enough in its </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural state,</v>

847
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.450
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't have nearly as much stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can use,</v>

848
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we're gonna do is we're going to</v>

849
00:37:14.161 --> 00:37:14.994
<v Speaker 2>transform the heck out of it by using </v>
<v Speaker 2>our minds to create these machines and </v>

850
00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:19.824
<v Speaker 2>then create energy that can feed these </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines and make ourselves a hundreds </v>

851
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:22.824
<v Speaker 2>of times more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the planet is going to look </v>

852
00:37:24.301 --> 00:37:26.370
<v Speaker 2>completely different because of what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

853
00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:29.190
<v Speaker 2>So I called this human progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is fantastic,</v>

854
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the Greens are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>anti humans,</v>

855
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.720
<v Speaker 2>they don't think this is fantastic.</v>

856
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.531
<v Speaker 2>They don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

857
00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:36.660
<v Speaker 2>it's all about us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't this so great?</v>

858
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:41.820
<v Speaker 2>What they're always worried about is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecology or the ecosystem or Gaia,</v>

859
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having some revenge on us.</v>

860
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.800
<v Speaker 2>But the focus is not really our power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually our stupidity.</v>

861
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:50.641
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

862
00:37:50.641 --> 00:37:51.870
<v Speaker 2>it's our hubris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>

863
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.720
<v Speaker 2>oh you think you can just change </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and be okay.</v>

864
00:37:54.721 --> 00:37:59.010
<v Speaker 2>You think that you can split the atom </v>
<v Speaker 2>and play God and it's going to be fine,</v>

865
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get punished.</v>

866
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:03.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they always have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>divine retribution.</v>

867
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Except it's not divine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the ecology.</v>

868
00:38:06.991 --> 00:38:07.824
<v Speaker 2>But no matter what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every decade they have a new form in </v>

869
00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 2>which ecosystem is going to exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>retribution for our industrial,</v>

870
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 2>since it always changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no,</v>

871
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:21.630
<v Speaker 2>there's no change in the dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just a change in the specific as</v>

872
00:38:21.631 --> 00:38:23.880
<v Speaker 2>the dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as each dynamic gets refuted.</v>

873
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>

874
00:38:24.951 --> 00:38:28.400
<v Speaker 1>So basically I think that they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally argue that someone like you is</v>

875
00:38:28.401 --> 00:38:29.810
<v Speaker 1>anti-science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they would say,</v>

876
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these climates,</v>

877
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.570
<v Speaker 1>I had to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's saying the reverse,</v>

878
00:38:32.571 --> 00:38:36.640
<v Speaker 1>but what you're saying is actually bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti-science because yeah,</v>

879
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:37.474
<v Speaker 1>we split the atom and then they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some bad shit's going to happen </v>

880
00:38:39.761 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 1>because we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would say,</v>

881
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what human progress is,</v>

882
00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:42.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

883
00:38:42.951 --> 00:38:43.784
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit's going to happen and we'll </v>

884
00:38:45.461 --> 00:38:47.410
<v Speaker 1>have to fee and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure that out,</v>

885
00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:47.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

886
00:38:47.921 --> 00:38:49.750
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really is the most scientific.</v>

887
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd say,</v>

888
00:38:50.791 --> 00:38:51.624
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally to put it in [inaudible] </v>

889
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.690
<v Speaker 2>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're anti mind.</v>

890
00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:56.580
<v Speaker 2>So one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one way of looking at this,</v>

891
00:38:56.581 --> 00:39:00.000
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned that there's this idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that manmade co two is bad.</v>

892
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Manmade radiation is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

893
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manmade industrialization is bad.</v>

894
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.560
<v Speaker 2>So basically everything manmade is </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered bad.</v>

895
00:39:07.561 --> 00:39:09.420
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now at this moment in time,</v>

896
00:39:09.421 --> 00:39:13.200
<v Speaker 2>plastic bags are considered less natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>than paper if you go into whole foods,</v>

897
00:39:13.201 --> 00:39:14.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about natural,</v>

898
00:39:14.911 --> 00:39:18.540
<v Speaker 2>local as little technology went into </v>
<v Speaker 2>this product as possible,</v>

899
00:39:18.541 --> 00:39:19.374
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what green ultimately boils down </v>

900
00:39:20.761 --> 00:39:21.300
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

901
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.133
<v Speaker 2>The ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about what does the ideal green </v>

902
00:39:23.701 --> 00:39:24.534
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideal green anything is what the </v>

903
00:39:26.401 --> 00:39:29.070
<v Speaker 2>world would look like if human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>had never existed.</v>

904
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.870
<v Speaker 2>That is their ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

905
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.730
<v Speaker 2>The eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the ideal form of food?</v>

906
00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.420
<v Speaker 2>The kind of food that we would exist if </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings had never existed,</v>

907
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:36.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

908
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.550
<v Speaker 2>What's the ideal amount of co two in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere?</v>

909
00:39:38.551 --> 00:39:41.490
<v Speaker 2>The amount of CO2 that would exist if </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings had never existed?</v>

910
00:39:41.491 --> 00:39:44.190
<v Speaker 2>What's the amount of radiation if human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings never existed?</v>

911
00:39:44.191 --> 00:39:46.710
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this very deep premise.</v>

912
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:51.780
<v Speaker 2>So what is the manmade?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The manmade is simply the form of change</v>

913
00:39:51.781 --> 00:39:54.390
<v Speaker 2>in nature that exists created by a human</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

914
00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.160
<v Speaker 2>That's the only difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

915
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:57.023
<v Speaker 2>Change is inherent in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why climate change is this kind </v>

916
00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:00.030
<v Speaker 2>of a name term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

917
00:40:00.031 --> 00:40:00.864
<v Speaker 2>But everything changes things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is transforming things in </v>

918
00:40:03.151 --> 00:40:05.070
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the manmade,</v>

919
00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:07.500
<v Speaker 2>the only difference is that it's driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>by a mind.</v>

920
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:08.543
<v Speaker 2>So if you're anti manmade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're anti mind made and you're anti </v>

921
00:40:11.431 --> 00:40:13.050
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you might ask,</v>

922
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.060
<v Speaker 2>why do they appeal the science all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

923
00:40:15.061 --> 00:40:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Why do they try to take the high ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>on science?</v>

924
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:17.963
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is because science has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of prestige and if you want to put </v>

925
00:40:20.101 --> 00:40:20.934
<v Speaker 2>over bad ideas in volk science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but notice they're against all the </v>

926
00:40:24.091 --> 00:40:28.110
<v Speaker 2>practical products of science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least the core one,</v>

927
00:40:28.111 --> 00:40:29.660
<v Speaker 2>the core leaders of the movement.</v>

928
00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Well they're using them all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

929
00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:32.841
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

930
00:40:32.841 --> 00:40:34.910
<v Speaker 1>they're using all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>science has given us.</v>

931
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:35.341
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

932
00:40:35.341 --> 00:40:38.340
<v Speaker 2>the way I think of it as this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like would the green movement,</v>

933
00:40:38.341 --> 00:40:40.380
<v Speaker 2>if it could go back in time with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>green movement,</v>

934
00:40:40.381 --> 00:40:43.170
<v Speaker 2>have approved turning a patch of dirt </v>
<v Speaker 2>and trees into New York City?</v>

935
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:44.883
<v Speaker 1>What day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Green Greenpeace of a thumbs up to </v>

936
00:40:46.731 --> 00:40:48.590
<v Speaker 1>New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess at best it would have been a lot</v>

937
00:40:48.591 --> 00:40:50.170
<v Speaker 1>slower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No chance.</v>

938
00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:51.930
<v Speaker 1>No chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

939
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.150
<v Speaker 1>So Central Park would be allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

940
00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:53.600
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

941
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.560
<v Speaker 2>their philosophy would have prevented </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that we know,</v>

942
00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from existing,</v>

943
00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.450
<v Speaker 2>but they are parasites on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>

944
00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're,</v>

945
00:41:03.321 --> 00:41:04.154
<v Speaker 2>they're hypocrites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is the way that all bad ideas </v>

946
00:41:06.321 --> 00:41:07.154
<v Speaker 2>work is basically the people promoting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad ideas want people to contradict </v>

947
00:41:10.431 --> 00:41:12.710
<v Speaker 2>them to a certain amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we followed all the bad ideas.</v>

948
00:41:12.711 --> 00:41:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

949
00:41:13.761 --> 00:41:17.090
<v Speaker 2>What they want is people to contradict </v>
<v Speaker 2>them so they can feed off of them.</v>

950
00:41:17.091 --> 00:41:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is bred out of atlas </v>
<v Speaker 2>shrugged,</v>

951
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.113
<v Speaker 2>but then they can keep them guilty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so what they want for the </v>

952
00:41:21.801 --> 00:41:23.930
<v Speaker 2>industrialists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you look at the oil companies or</v>

953
00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:26.630
<v Speaker 2>any companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they want is for the oil companies,</v>

954
00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.190
<v Speaker 2>they don't want the oil companies not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

955
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:29.203
<v Speaker 2>They want the oil companies to work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be super guilty and give them money and </v>

956
00:41:32.091 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>tell them that they're great for being </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

957
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 2>for being nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for accomplishing,</v>

958
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:37.220
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for producing nothing.</v>

959
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.233
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically people that very deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment of productive human beings </v>

960
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:42.763
<v Speaker 2>who want to feel important and </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist are anti humanism gave </v>

961
00:41:45.531 --> 00:41:47.840
<v Speaker 2>them this perfect vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we call an anti humanism,</v>

962
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.090
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be a lot less confident</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there'll be fewer of them.</v>

963
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.013
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because as you're saying </v>

964
00:41:51.591 --> 00:41:52.960
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me think of,</v>

965
00:41:52.961 --> 00:41:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I've what I've been saying lately about </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pundits on television,</v>

966
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:56.803
<v Speaker 1>they've ever made anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never done anything that's </v>

967
00:41:58.671 --> 00:41:59.504
<v Speaker 1>created and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they somehow know how to do </v>

968
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:02.720
<v Speaker 1>everything all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

969
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.733
<v Speaker 1>They always know that healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we saved $200 billion to do this and </v>

970
00:42:05.901 --> 00:42:07.820
<v Speaker 1>put this tax cut and Barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

971
00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've never done anything.</v>

972
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:12.230
<v Speaker 1>You just keep saying things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've never actually created.</v>

973
00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot easier to do that then </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually create,</v>

974
00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.550
<v Speaker 2>I think psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't studied this,</v>

975
00:42:17.551 --> 00:42:18.384
<v Speaker 2>but this is plausible to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard different studies that </v>

976
00:42:20.281 --> 00:42:21.114
<v Speaker 2>there's just a deep and fewer </v>
<v Speaker 2>inferiority complex among intellectuals </v>

977
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.490
<v Speaker 2>who just don't really feel productive in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain way.</v>

978
00:42:29.491 --> 00:42:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't experience this myself.</v>

979
00:42:30.961 --> 00:42:31.794
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's useful to learn how to do </v>

980
00:42:32.671 --> 00:42:33.504
<v Speaker 2>certain kinds of physical things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also am an intellectual who </v>

981
00:42:36.511 --> 00:42:41.511
<v Speaker 2>worships the physical creators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I give them justice and I know,</v>

982
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's buttering my bread.</v>

983
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

984
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:45.181
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

985
00:42:45.181 --> 00:42:46.014
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know when I talked to somebody from </v>

986
00:42:47.971 --> 00:42:52.050
<v Speaker 2>industry that they are making possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>my way of life.</v>

987
00:42:52.051 --> 00:42:56.100
<v Speaker 2>And for instance the universities or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite because modern universities,</v>

988
00:42:56.101 --> 00:42:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have way too many people going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to college I think.</v>

989
00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.093
<v Speaker 2>But however many people we would like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to college is way more than the </v>

990
00:43:01.351 --> 00:43:04.500
<v Speaker 2>number that would go to college if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were non industrialized.</v>

991
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:08.880
<v Speaker 2>And yet the universities have incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>contempt for industry.</v>

992
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:09.743
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's just a very disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that you have all these talking </v>

993
00:43:14.071 --> 00:43:14.904
<v Speaker 2>heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these mindless students often and </v>

994
00:43:17.041 --> 00:43:17.874
<v Speaker 2>they have no appreciation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say even the fossil fuel </v>

995
00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:22.410
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're screwing up way more than I think.</v>

996
00:43:22.411 --> 00:43:23.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even put it though.</v>

997
00:43:23.281 --> 00:43:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I think they're doing a great job in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>

998
00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:26.183
<v Speaker 2>but you should still have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciation for what they're </v>

999
00:43:28.411 --> 00:43:29.800
<v Speaker 2>accomplishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1000
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:33.780
<v Speaker 2>and you should still realize that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying them to do that.</v>

1001
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:34.703
<v Speaker 2>So we have this idea where the non </v>
<v Speaker 2>producers can demand this impossible </v>

1002
00:43:38.791 --> 00:43:39.624
<v Speaker 2>perfection of the producers and look </v>
<v Speaker 2>down on them even though you're doing </v>

1003
00:43:42.601 --> 00:43:43.434
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like the Teddy Roosevelt Teddy </v>

1004
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Roosevelt quote about the man in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arena.</v>

1005
00:43:47.161 --> 00:43:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Like Teddy Roosevelt is really into </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports and stuff.</v>

1006
00:43:49.861 --> 00:43:53.250
<v Speaker 2>So he talks about how the man in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arena is the one who's admirable,</v>

1007
00:43:53.251 --> 00:43:56.310
<v Speaker 2>even though everyone else side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it's not the critic who counts.</v>

1008
00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:57.590
<v Speaker 1>There's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>

1009
00:43:57.591 --> 00:43:58.421
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are you watching?</v>

1010
00:43:58.421 --> 00:43:59.254
<v Speaker 1>A basketball game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they always know every though it's </v>

1011
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:01.503
<v Speaker 1>just like</v>

1012
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:04.550
<v Speaker 2>going on with Lebron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1013
00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:05.210
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1014
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's,</v>

1015
00:44:07.061 --> 00:44:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all that said,</v>

1016
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:09.674
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when something like the Exxon Valdez </v>

1017
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.300
<v Speaker 1>happens or the BP oil spill in the Gulf </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when these things happen,</v>

1018
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.130
<v Speaker 1>now I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's,</v>

1019
00:44:16.131 --> 00:44:18.500
<v Speaker 1>nothing's a perfect system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these things are gonna happen.</v>

1020
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:19.813
<v Speaker 1>But for someone like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see the BP oil spill and you </v>

1021
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:22.424
<v Speaker 1>see all of the birds and the auditors </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this stuff covered in all this </v>

1022
00:44:25.461 --> 00:44:26.770
<v Speaker 1>oil and know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1023
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I just remember those days where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a online,</v>

1024
00:44:29.661 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you could just watch that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a pipe,</v>

1025
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:34.410
<v Speaker 1>that burst pipe just spewing all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff into the ocean.</v>

1026
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about that?</v>

1027
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a negative,</v>

1028
00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.490
<v Speaker 2>but there's an end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always this issue of magnitude.</v>

1029
00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:40.413
<v Speaker 2>And I always look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly if I know that we have a </v>

1030
00:44:41.861 --> 00:44:44.050
<v Speaker 2>tendency to be biased against one </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>

1031
00:44:44.051 --> 00:44:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm always suspicious of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why is this?</v>

1032
00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Why is the oil spill considered the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst thing in the world?</v>

1033
00:44:49.631 --> 00:44:51.730
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 people died on that.</v>

1034
00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.013
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the tragedy of an mean 11 </v>

1035
00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:56.890
<v Speaker 2>there's thing exploded,</v>

1036
00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the guy who people</v>

1037
00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.100
<v Speaker 2>are extinguished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1038
00:45:00.101 --> 00:45:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean they never get to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>again in their families.</v>

1039
00:45:03.161 --> 00:45:04.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wives are just,</v>

1040
00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.010
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the thing.</v>

1041
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.760
<v Speaker 2>If you look at what I mean oil is to use</v>
<v Speaker 2>a green term,</v>

1042
00:45:09.761 --> 00:45:11.500
<v Speaker 2>like an organic substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1043
00:45:11.501 --> 00:45:15.790
<v Speaker 2>it's just ancient kind of life and lots </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things in the ocean like it.</v>

1044
00:45:15.791 --> 00:45:17.920
<v Speaker 2>And then certain kinds of animals don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

1045
00:45:17.921 --> 00:45:18.754
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course the only point to the </v>

1046
00:45:19.871 --> 00:45:20.351
<v Speaker 2>bird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1047
00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:22.150
<v Speaker 2>so if it's on a bird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll choke the bird.</v>

1048
00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.710
<v Speaker 2>And that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1049
00:45:23.711 --> 00:45:27.040
<v Speaker 2>that's not something that I relish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in terms of the things that happened</v>

1050
00:45:27.041 --> 00:45:30.310
<v Speaker 2>to human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an oil spill is pretty low on the list.</v>

1051
00:45:30.311 --> 00:45:33.760
<v Speaker 2>So what I think it shows is this idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>again of the manmade.</v>

1052
00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.430
<v Speaker 2>If we accidentally put oil somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bad.</v>

1053
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.331
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two,</v>

1054
00:45:37.331 --> 00:45:38.164
<v Speaker 2>Exxon Valdez is coming out of the Gulf </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Mexico naturally all the time in the </v>

1055
00:45:41.351 --> 00:45:42.280
<v Speaker 2>form of oil seeps.</v>

1056
00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:45.760
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the tar sands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just one giant oil spill,</v>

1057
00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:46.933
<v Speaker 2>a by nature in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we always have to watch out </v>

1058
00:45:49.631 --> 00:45:53.200
<v Speaker 2>for this bias against the manmade bias </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the human.</v>

1059
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I think the sort of better examples are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1060
00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.633
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was solar and wind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an example I talk about in the </v>

1061
00:45:59.051 --> 00:45:59.884
<v Speaker 2>book where when you're mining for those </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements for the kinds of metals that </v>

1062
00:46:02.921 --> 00:46:06.040
<v Speaker 2>you use and in solar panels and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and particularly windmills,</v>

1063
00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:07.203
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people die a lot because they happen in </v>

1064
00:46:09.701 --> 00:46:12.730
<v Speaker 2>places like China and they're in very </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous situations because you're in,</v>

1065
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.330
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with legitimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatening amounts of radioactivity and</v>

1066
00:46:16.331 --> 00:46:17.164
<v Speaker 2>nobody cares about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I always look at what are the actual </v>

1067
00:46:19.811 --> 00:46:23.540
<v Speaker 2>threats and non threats of every form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and what I try to do it,</v>

1068
00:46:23.541 --> 00:46:26.770
<v Speaker 2>and I think chapter two of the book is </v>
<v Speaker 2>go through them in a pretty,</v>

1069
00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.053
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairway cause it's not like I started </v>

1070
00:46:29.321 --> 00:46:30.850
<v Speaker 2>out being pro fossil fuels.</v>

1071
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:33.520
<v Speaker 2>It's something that I came to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1072
00:46:33.521 --> 00:46:35.900
<v Speaker 2>as a kid I thought some like solar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I,</v>

1073
00:46:35.901 --> 00:46:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I was never anti-nuclear really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the simpsons scared me a little bit,</v>

1074
00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:42.070
<v Speaker 2>but I just kind of always figured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well solar's the greatest thing.</v>

1075
00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.860
<v Speaker 2>But then once I looked at the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1076
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:45.993
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not nearly and why are the Enviros </v>

1077
00:46:49.001 --> 00:46:52.420
<v Speaker 2>so focused on this when they could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused on nuclear?</v>

1078
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.520
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think the kind of most,</v>

1079
00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:56.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that are more of a concern,</v>

1080
00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.750
<v Speaker 2>like can you say smog in China?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1081
00:46:58.751 --> 00:46:59.584
<v Speaker 2>Because to me that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something where that's clearly a </v>

1082
00:47:02.111 --> 00:47:05.050
<v Speaker 2>very unpleasant and in some cases </v>
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy thing,</v>

1083
00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:06.003
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally affecting someone's life on </v>

1084
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:12.420
<v Speaker 1>that day to day basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me that's much more of a concern than</v>

1085
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:15.120
<v Speaker 1>an oil spill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what in a case like that,</v>

1086
00:47:15.121 --> 00:47:15.954
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're acknowledging that it's a </v>

1087
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 1>legitimate concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

1088
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:20.363
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you've now find industry that </v>

1089
00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:22.620
<v Speaker 1>cleans it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1090
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the next level in the colonies.</v>

1091
00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Milan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1092
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1093
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:26.653
<v Speaker 2>like to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to look back in time and just </v>

1094
00:47:28.581 --> 00:47:29.414
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I like to look at the 18 hundreds </v>

1095
00:47:30.341 --> 00:47:33.730
<v Speaker 2>it's just sort of a reference point </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you look at that time,</v>

1096
00:47:33.731 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 2>they had much worse smog than China does</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1097
00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what much worse?</v>

1098
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.240
<v Speaker 2>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they have a green movement that said</v>

1099
00:47:40.241 --> 00:47:42.220
<v Speaker 2>this is ruining everything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we hate it.</v>

1100
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.413
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had that as a letter that I </v>

1101
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.060
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which says basically they,</v>

1102
00:47:47.061 --> 00:47:47.894
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're worried about running out of </v>

1103
00:47:48.551 --> 00:47:49.384
<v Speaker 2>coal because they don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the geology of it and how </v>

1104
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:53.830
<v Speaker 2>much of it there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>

1105
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically this would be like losing a </v>

1106
00:47:55.991 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 2>limb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be that bad.</v>

1107
00:47:57.941 --> 00:47:58.774
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something that's has all the </v>

1108
00:47:59.641 --> 00:48:01.300
<v Speaker 2>smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so from our perspective,</v>

1109
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:01.751
<v Speaker 2>we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1110
00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:03.190
<v Speaker 2>this is so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so dirty.</v>

1111
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:07.300
<v Speaker 2>But why do they value it so much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't even focus on that?</v>

1112
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Because the value of energy to empower </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to improve their lives,</v>

1113
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:15.130
<v Speaker 2>to actually be fed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually be warm,</v>

1114
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.860
<v Speaker 2>that takes precedence over everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1115
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.850
<v Speaker 2>And so then the point is that whenever </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're defining a threshold of pollution</v>

1116
00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:22.923
<v Speaker 2>that you need to legislate regarding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to have the context of what's </v>

1117
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:29.770
<v Speaker 2>overall beneficial for human life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what your alternatives are.</v>

1118
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.813
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fortunately today we don't have to </v>

1119
00:48:32.021 --> 00:48:35.500
<v Speaker 2>accept that threshold of Smog and smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1120
00:48:35.501 --> 00:48:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Because we have all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternatives and we have technology.</v>

1121
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.970
<v Speaker 2>So I think in the case of China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1122
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 2>it's a midway case where they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a dictatorship,</v>

1123
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:46.060
<v Speaker 2>because they don't respect individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights in many ways.</v>

1124
00:48:46.061 --> 00:48:47.980
<v Speaker 2>What they did is they built a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>coal plants,</v>

1125
00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:51.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's not primarily coal plants is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually other things that you use cold.</v>

1126
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:53.080
<v Speaker 2>They're just burning it in a very open </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1127
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.183
<v Speaker 2>But they did this very haphazardly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had this national goal of </v>

1128
00:48:56.831 --> 00:49:00.670
<v Speaker 2>industrialization without focusing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of industrialization,</v>

1129
00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:01.504
<v Speaker 2>which is human flourishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think if China and India had much </v>

1130
00:49:03.581 --> 00:49:05.770
<v Speaker 2>better governments that focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual rights,</v>

1131
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.960
<v Speaker 2>they would have much less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't,</v>

1132
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.823
<v Speaker 2>that's not to say they would have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same standards that we do because they </v>

1133
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:12.400
<v Speaker 2>don't have the same level of wealth that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>

1134
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:16.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's contextual based on the state of</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic and technological development.</v>

1135
00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.970
<v Speaker 2>And one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one great philosopher in front of mine,</v>

1136
00:49:18.971 --> 00:49:19.804
<v Speaker 2>while I was writing the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave me this great analogy about you </v>

1137
00:49:21.951 --> 00:49:23.170
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say the same thing about human</v>

1138
00:49:23.171 --> 00:49:24.004
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a point that I think is </v>

1139
00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 2>really important that people are afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>of coal plants.</v>

1140
00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.070
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of you.</v>

1141
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of humans because humans are </v>
<v Speaker 2>way dirtier.</v>

1142
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.983
<v Speaker 2>Then our machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again shows that were against </v>

1143
00:49:36.821 --> 00:49:39.220
<v Speaker 2>manmade things because we're afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine waste,</v>

1144
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.290
<v Speaker 2>but not human waste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human waste.</v>

1145
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.400
<v Speaker 2>And particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1146
00:49:42.401 --> 00:49:46.450
<v Speaker 2>the air we breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathe out is biological and biological</v>

1147
00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:48.170
<v Speaker 2>as much more dangerous than </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonbiological.</v>

1148
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:49.143
<v Speaker 2>So if I get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be from someone in this </v>

1149
00:49:51.011 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 2>room and you know that's how you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get sick and die most likely.</v>

1150
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 2>So why do we allow ourselves this kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of pollution?</v>

1151
00:49:57.941 --> 00:49:58.511
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1152
00:49:58.511 --> 00:49:59.344
<v Speaker 2>because at the moment it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologically preventable in any </v>

1153
00:50:01.961 --> 00:50:02.794
<v Speaker 2>economic way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's much more dangerous than what </v>

1154
00:50:03.581 --> 00:50:04.950
<v Speaker 2>the gold plants are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1155
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen anything to contradict </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1156
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.050
<v Speaker 2>but in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1157
00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:08.561
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1158
00:50:08.561 --> 00:50:09.394
<v Speaker 2>what if you had buildings where you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>affordable technology that could filter </v>

1159
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:14.350
<v Speaker 2>all these diseases?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you might say,</v>

1160
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're required to do this right?</v>

1161
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Or you're required to disclose if your </v>
<v Speaker 2>building doesn't have this.</v>

1162
00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.213
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is considered a dangerous thing in </v>

1163
00:50:23.861 --> 00:50:27.890
<v Speaker 2>the future could be considered a normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in the present.</v>

1164
00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:28.631
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1165
00:50:28.631 --> 00:50:29.464
<v Speaker 1>So I want to spend basically the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time we have here discussing the </v>

1166
00:50:31.631 --> 00:50:34.810
<v Speaker 1>real underlying issue to all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very much related to everything</v>

1167
00:50:34.811 --> 00:50:35.644
<v Speaker 1>I do on this show about free speech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the role of government and all this </v>

1168
00:50:38.591 --> 00:50:41.290
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned Al Gore before and uh,</v>

1169
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my things with Al Gore is that,</v>

1170
00:50:43.181 --> 00:50:43.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1171
00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:44.733
<v Speaker 1>I saw the movie an inconvenient truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked it at that w when did </v>

1172
00:50:47.831 --> 00:50:49.930
<v Speaker 1>that come out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About 2006.</v>

1173
00:50:49.931 --> 00:50:50.591
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

1174
00:50:50.591 --> 00:50:52.270
<v Speaker 1>really liked it at the time I thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1175
00:50:52.271 --> 00:50:55.270
<v Speaker 1>we woke up some things in me that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't thought of before.</v>

1176
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fast forward to what?</v>

1177
00:50:57.161 --> 00:50:57.994
<v Speaker 1>About three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al Gore decided to sell current TV to </v>

1178
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.333
<v Speaker 1>the government of Qatar so they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>put allergists ear on here and the </v>

1179
00:51:05.081 --> 00:51:07.950
<v Speaker 1>government card does tons of fun stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>with fossil fuels.</v>

1180
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.030
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he basically created the producers.</v>

1181
00:51:10.031 --> 00:51:14.260
<v Speaker 1>He created a failed network and s and </v>
<v Speaker 1>profited on it for $500 million.</v>

1182
00:51:14.261 --> 00:51:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean he did the producers he used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he leveraged the first one to point this</v>

1183
00:51:17.891 --> 00:51:19.570
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying it for a while.</v>

1184
00:51:19.571 --> 00:51:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's basically a max be all stock.</v>

1185
00:51:22.601 --> 00:51:23.434
<v Speaker 1>Like he created the pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he created a failed network and then </v>

1186
00:51:26.051 --> 00:51:26.884
<v Speaker 1>ultimately he walked away with a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and the reason he was able to </v>

1187
00:51:29.021 --> 00:51:29.854
<v Speaker 1>create the network was cause he was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vice president had all the connections </v>

1188
00:51:31.811 --> 00:51:32.644
<v Speaker 1>and telecoms and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to get on cable channels </v>

1189
00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:35.524
<v Speaker 1>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically we created a shitty </v>

1190
00:51:36.401 --> 00:51:37.234
<v Speaker 1>product that he walked away with a ton </v>
<v Speaker 1>of money and at the same time he took a </v>

1191
00:51:41.201 --> 00:51:42.034
<v Speaker 1>massive check from the government of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Qatar who does a ton obviously with </v>

1192
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.040
<v Speaker 1>fossil fuels that he's always railing </v>
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>

1193
00:51:48.041 --> 00:51:49.900
<v Speaker 1>So I'm putting that out there that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no,</v>

1194
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.823
<v Speaker 1>I suspect something's not quite right </v>
<v Speaker 1>with what this guy is doing in the </v>

1195
00:51:53.531 --> 00:51:54.364
<v Speaker 1>scheme of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But can you lay out a perhaps more </v>

1196
00:51:58.050 --> 00:51:58.883
<v Speaker 1>enlightened case than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just doing the producers because I </v>

1197
00:52:01.091 --> 00:52:01.924
<v Speaker 1>sensed that</v>

1198
00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.400
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1199
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically the,</v>

1200
00:52:04.891 --> 00:52:05.724
<v Speaker 1>the federal government right now it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds like is starting to attack think </v>

1201
00:52:09.791 --> 00:52:10.660
<v Speaker 1>tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1202
00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:14.830
<v Speaker 1>But they're attacking think tanks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the very work that you do.</v>

1203
00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:15.664
<v Speaker 1>Now I would argue that because I believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>in free speech than a think tank should </v>

1204
00:52:18.551 --> 00:52:19.384
<v Speaker 1>be allowed to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't like governmental control </v>

1205
00:52:21.611 --> 00:52:22.444
<v Speaker 1>over thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I completely disagreed with </v>

1206
00:52:24.551 --> 00:52:26.250
<v Speaker 1>whatever the premise of the think tank </v>
<v Speaker 1>was knowing.</v>

1207
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is happening right now.</v>

1208
00:52:28.811 --> 00:52:29.644
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

1209
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:33.340
<v Speaker 1>how is that directly related to Al Gore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow when the,</v>

1210
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:35.030
<v Speaker 1>cause he's not part of the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1211
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1212
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.890
<v Speaker 2>But he is a figurehead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

1213
00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what the legality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1214
00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.213
<v Speaker 2>but when they announced this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I guess we should give people a </v>

1215
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:48.510
<v Speaker 2>little bit more context there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's happened is over the years,</v>

1216
00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:52.980
<v Speaker 2>what I call the climate catastrophists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just don't want to quickly,</v>

1217
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.090
<v Speaker 2>we haven't talked much about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the climate issue specifically.</v>

1218
00:52:55.091 --> 00:52:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1219
00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.930
<v Speaker 2>just in terms of my view and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's view,</v>

1220
00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:01.530
<v Speaker 2>there's not this idea of climate </v>
<v Speaker 2>believers in climate deniers.</v>

1221
00:53:01.531 --> 00:53:04.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a really a dumb old kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative.</v>

1222
00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.193
<v Speaker 2>But there are different assessments of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the magnitude of the warming influence </v>

1223
00:53:09.811 --> 00:53:10.644
<v Speaker 2>of co two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we put x amount of co two in the </v>

1224
00:53:12.271 --> 00:53:13.104
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say 130 parts per million or </v>

1225
00:53:15.871 --> 00:53:16.704
<v Speaker 2>0.013%</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the beginning of the industrial </v>

1226
00:53:18.901 --> 00:53:19.734
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question is how much does that </v>

1227
00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:25.470
<v Speaker 2>affect climate in terms of primarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>warming then anything that comes warming</v>

1228
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:26.543
<v Speaker 2>and then how much can it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be anticipated to affect in the </v>

1229
00:53:28.411 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 2>future as we put another point.</v>

1230
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh 1% another point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh 1% another point.</v>

1231
00:53:32.411 --> 00:53:33.244
<v Speaker 2>Oh 1%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so basically we could go into the </v>

1232
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:35.790
<v Speaker 2>details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have time.</v>

1233
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.863
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people think that that's a very </v>

1234
00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:42.630
<v Speaker 2>mild and manageable warming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1235
00:53:42.631 --> 00:53:43.464
<v Speaker 2>and they point to things like the amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of co two in the atmosphere in terms of </v>

1236
00:53:46.261 --> 00:53:48.680
<v Speaker 2>the geology of the globe is at almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>record lows.</v>

1237
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:49.523
<v Speaker 2>Temperatures are at almost record lows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in terms of the history of the </v>

1238
00:53:51.781 --> 00:53:52.614
<v Speaker 2>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we had 20 times more co two it was </v>

1239
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:56.490
<v Speaker 2>a very fertile time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two is plant food.</v>

1240
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.650
<v Speaker 2>So what they argue is that CO2 and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>argue is a,</v>

1241
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:03.090
<v Speaker 2>has a warming effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's what's called a decelerating or</v>

1242
00:54:03.091 --> 00:54:05.580
<v Speaker 2>logarithmic effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's actually not controversial,</v>

1243
00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 2>but then the other side says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1244
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:10.830
<v Speaker 2>even though it's a decelerating effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the lab and the atmosphere,</v>

1245
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:11.664
<v Speaker 2>there are these other dynamics that make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it into this xl accelerating or very </v>

1246
00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 2>dramatic thing.</v>

1247
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:19.030
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we can expect runaway </v>
<v Speaker 2>warming.</v>

1248
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Pause there real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the decelerating meaning that at some</v>

1249
00:54:21.571 --> 00:54:22.404
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you're putting this stuff </v>

1250
00:54:23.341 --> 00:54:24.174
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually start sort of simulating </v>

1251
00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:27.803
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a function like </v>

1252
00:54:29.641 --> 00:54:31.950
<v Speaker 2>diminishing returns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about like when you press</v>

1253
00:54:31.951 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 2>the pedal on your gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1254
00:54:33.931 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 2>So at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every little push it goes faster to like</v>

1255
00:54:38.311 --> 00:54:39.930
<v Speaker 2>55 and after the go slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1256
00:54:39.931 --> 00:54:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you'd just take off like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rocket and could go forever.</v>

1257
00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:44.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1258
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.730
<v Speaker 2>it's the same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every molecule of co two warms less than</v>

1259
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:49.830
<v Speaker 2>the last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is an uncontroversial scientific</v>

1260
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:51.030
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

1261
00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:54.000
<v Speaker 2>is part of why you need to learn a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit about the science.</v>

1262
00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:57.270
<v Speaker 2>You just have to ask people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The key thing is what's demonstrated and</v>

1263
00:54:57.271 --> 00:54:58.104
<v Speaker 2>what's speculated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this phenomenon of CO2 has </v>

1264
00:54:59.821 --> 00:55:01.140
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1265
00:55:01.141 --> 00:55:03.090
<v Speaker 2>there's this other set of theories </v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1266
00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:04.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think are very speculative,</v>

1267
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:05.723
<v Speaker 2>certainly not proven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have to do with catastrophic </v>

1268
00:55:07.801 --> 00:55:08.310
<v Speaker 2>warming.</v>

1269
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 2>But other people are allowed to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>those theories.</v>

1270
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:11.303
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to suppress the theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think upon examination there very </v>

1271
00:55:13.921 --> 00:55:14.754
<v Speaker 2>dubious and whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at them in the context </v>

1272
00:55:17.461 --> 00:55:18.294
<v Speaker 2>of the benefits of fossil fuels to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you always have to look at the big </v>

1273
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:22.530
<v Speaker 2>picture no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But basically what I call the,</v>

1274
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:24.840
<v Speaker 2>so I'm calling them the catastrophists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>

1275
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:26.440
<v Speaker 2>that's why I call them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophists.</v>

1276
00:55:26.441 --> 00:55:29.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a nonbeliever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just believe in mild.</v>

1277
00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:30.361
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1278
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:33.750
<v Speaker 2>that's just the distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically what the catastrophist have</v>

1279
00:55:33.751 --> 00:55:34.584
<v Speaker 2>had is what they consider failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I consider them enormously </v>

1280
00:55:37.171 --> 00:55:40.800
<v Speaker 2>successful on their own terms because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they've indoctrinated,</v>

1281
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole world.</v>

1282
00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hadn't passed a lot of bad policies,</v>

1283
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.773
<v Speaker 2>but on their terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have not shut down the fossil fuel </v>

1284
00:55:47.941 --> 00:55:48.511
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1285
00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:51.420
<v Speaker 2>they want to shut down 80% of it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next 30 years,</v>

1286
00:55:51.421 --> 00:55:52.440
<v Speaker 2>the next 35 years.</v>

1287
00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:55.410
<v Speaker 2>They're not accomplishing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to pass cap and trade.</v>

1288
00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:57.270
<v Speaker 2>So what they've done over the past </v>
<v Speaker 2>several years,</v>

1289
00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.253
<v Speaker 2>their basic premises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the reason we haven't done this </v>

1290
00:55:59.831 --> 00:56:03.240
<v Speaker 2>because people are idiots and there must</v>
<v Speaker 2>be some villain who's causing this.</v>

1291
00:56:03.241 --> 00:56:04.830
<v Speaker 2>So of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the villain?</v>

1292
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:05.993
<v Speaker 2>Big Oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's allegedly forcing us to buy oil </v>

1293
00:56:08.101 --> 00:56:10.560
<v Speaker 2>when in fact we basically ask them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce the old,</v>

1294
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:11.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1295
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.983
<v Speaker 2>but so what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this thing called the </v>

1296
00:56:13.861 --> 00:56:14.694
<v Speaker 2>divestment movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically sell all of your oil </v>

1297
00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:18.840
<v Speaker 2>stock and that'll demonize them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone will hate them and then they'll</v>

1298
00:56:18.841 --> 00:56:21.000
<v Speaker 2>vote against him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mad hasn't worked so well so far.</v>

1299
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:24.700
<v Speaker 2>So now what they have is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the government actually prosecuting,</v>

1300
00:56:24.701 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I would argue persecuting the company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So different attorney to General.</v>

1301
00:56:28.631 --> 00:56:29.021
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1302
00:56:29.021 --> 00:56:31.570
<v Speaker 2>each state has an attorney general and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing,</v>

1303
00:56:31.571 --> 00:56:32.404
<v Speaker 2>they're going after the biggest and </v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly baddest Exxon Mobil and the </v>

1304
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:39.130
<v Speaker 2>attorney generals are saying basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exxon,</v>

1305
00:56:39.131 --> 00:56:39.964
<v Speaker 2>you over the years have not expressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we believe are the proper climate </v>

1306
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 2>catastrophists views.</v>

1307
00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 2>And in fact you have funded people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have those views.</v>

1308
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:49.300
<v Speaker 2>So if you just said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd think,</v>

1309
00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:50.380
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you're allowed to do that,</v>

1310
00:56:50.381 --> 00:56:51.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is America.</v>

1311
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:52.264
<v Speaker 2>You're free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they've done is they've called </v>

1312
00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:55.110
<v Speaker 2>it fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1313
00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:59.740
<v Speaker 2>They said you've defrauded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for many reasons it's not fraud.</v>

1314
00:56:59.741 --> 00:57:01.270
<v Speaker 2>And the basic thing is for it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraud,</v>

1315
00:57:01.271 --> 00:57:02.104
<v Speaker 2>you have to misrepresent specific facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fraud is not expect expressing a wrong </v>

1316
00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:08.140
<v Speaker 2>opinion or even a wrong opinion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>serves you.</v>

1317
00:57:08.141 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Companies do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's misrepresenting specific facts that</v>

1318
00:57:11.621 --> 00:57:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you have specific access to right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest tension really.</v>

1319
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:16.431
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

1320
00:57:16.431 --> 00:57:16.940
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

1321
00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a specific thing like you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresent.</v>

1322
00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.610
<v Speaker 2>So let's say Exxon selling a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain kind of gasoline,</v>

1323
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:24.040
<v Speaker 2>then they misrepresent the contents of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1324
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:24.903
<v Speaker 2>That's fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they didn't misrepresent the fact </v>

1325
00:57:26.771 --> 00:57:29.470
<v Speaker 2>that gasoline admits CO2 when you burn </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1326
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1327
00:57:30.851 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 2>And the experts on that were mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>government scientist.</v>

1328
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 2>So Exxon didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have an ability to defrauded anyone.</v>

1329
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:40.840
<v Speaker 2>It had an ability to express opinions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to fund people or be affiliated with</v>

1330
00:57:40.841 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>express different opinions.</v>

1331
00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:44.800
<v Speaker 2>So what happened then is the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>subpoenaed Exxon,</v>

1332
00:57:44.801 --> 00:57:45.634
<v Speaker 2>different people subpoenaed Exxon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also started going after think </v>

1333
00:57:47.921 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 2>tanks that they suspected might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected with Exxon.</v>

1334
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:54.190
<v Speaker 2>And several wednesdays ago they came </v>
<v Speaker 2>after me,</v>

1335
00:57:54.191 --> 00:57:57.670
<v Speaker 2>or at least I was named in a subpoena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means the government has any right</v>

1336
00:57:57.671 --> 00:57:58.504
<v Speaker 2>at once to records of any emails between</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone at my company and anyone at </v>

1337
00:58:02.591 --> 00:58:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Exxon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1338
00:58:03.671 --> 00:58:05.620
<v Speaker 2>and my views is a complete violation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my rights.</v>

1339
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:06.543
<v Speaker 2>And in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because I don't run a </v>

1340
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.823
<v Speaker 2>nonprofit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't run a company that accepts </v>

1341
00:58:09.941 --> 00:58:12.250
<v Speaker 2>donations are a for profit company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell books.</v>

1342
00:58:12.251 --> 00:58:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I sell lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1343
00:58:13.421 --> 00:58:14.254
<v Speaker 2>So there's no plausibility that Exxon is</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of paying me to do something and </v>

1344
00:58:18.101 --> 00:58:19.900
<v Speaker 2>they went after me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why did they go after me?</v>

1345
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Because I have a prominent book called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral case for fossil fuels.</v>

1346
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:26.080
<v Speaker 2>So what they're saying to me is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they're saying to me is,</v>

1347
00:58:26.081 --> 00:58:26.914
<v Speaker 2>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you expressed an opinion we </v>

1348
00:58:27.941 --> 00:58:28.774
<v Speaker 2>disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are going to invade your life and </v>

1349
00:58:32.081 --> 00:58:33.050
<v Speaker 2>people are afraid of that.</v>

1350
00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:33.953
<v Speaker 1>So how are they actually coming at like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they trying to do to you as a </v>

1351
00:58:37.831 --> 00:58:40.770
<v Speaker 1>for profit business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get what they can try to do with,</v>

1352
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:41.551
<v Speaker 1>with Exxon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1353
00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:42.384
<v Speaker 1>They can ultimately legislate things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would allow Exxon to not do </v>

1354
00:58:45.301 --> 00:58:48.990
<v Speaker 1>business the way it seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislating their prosecutor prosecuting</v>

1355
00:58:48.991 --> 00:58:50.010
<v Speaker 1>people in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1356
00:58:50.011 --> 00:58:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1357
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:51.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I understand that.</v>

1358
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.590
<v Speaker 1>But at what can they do to you as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's the same thing.</v>

1359
00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Competitive of Enterprise Institute.</v>

1360
00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:57.213
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for a while they were going </v>

1361
00:58:57.891 --> 00:59:00.740
<v Speaker 2>after that organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're going after that organization</v>

1362
00:59:00.741 --> 00:59:01.574
<v Speaker 2>as a party to it because of Exxon is </v>
<v Speaker 2>committing fraud than the people who </v>

1363
00:59:04.701 --> 00:59:05.534
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be considered a party to that </v>

1364
00:59:07.401 --> 00:59:09.620
<v Speaker 2>fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you see that the core issue,</v>

1365
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I just think my case brings out that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>core issue is expressing an opinion that</v>

1366
00:59:13.791 --> 00:59:15.830
<v Speaker 2>the government disagrees with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1367
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:18.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just goes against just a,</v>

1368
00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:19.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental principle of progress is </v>

1369
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:22.183
<v Speaker 2>speech because we can't make progress </v>
<v Speaker 2>without having the freedom to discuss </v>

1370
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:28.310
<v Speaker 2>ideas and debate ideas and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual clarity.</v>

1371
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 2>And so for this to happen is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really horrible.</v>

1372
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:35.130
<v Speaker 2>And I think I'm in a position where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was,</v>

1373
00:59:35.131 --> 00:59:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I was only named on the Sabine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't subpoenaed now,</v>

1374
00:59:37.461 --> 00:59:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't be in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But right now I'm,</v>

1375
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of latitude to speak out.</v>

1376
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I have 100% ownership of my company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if shareholders,</v>

1377
00:59:45.621 --> 00:59:48.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't have donors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not accountable to anybody.</v>

1378
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:49.243
<v Speaker 2>So I have an ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be very vocal about this issue now </v>

1379
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:53.324
<v Speaker 2>and I'm taking advantage of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully to preempt them from doing </v>

1380
00:59:56.001 --> 00:59:59.450
<v Speaker 2>something more in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that they did some attack recently</v>

1381
00:59:59.451 --> 01:00:01.700
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't named in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that was a coincidence,</v>

1382
01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:03.003
<v Speaker 2>but I defend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to make clear by defend </v>

1383
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.473
<v Speaker 2>Exxon's right to express its opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think it's been when it's </v>

1384
01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:10.430
<v Speaker 2>given way more money to climate </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophist,</v>

1385
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:12.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than it has to,</v>

1386
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.230
<v Speaker 2>I would say climate thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I would call myself A.</v>

1387
01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:17.360
<v Speaker 2>I think in general they've been way too </v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathetic.</v>

1388
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:20.090
<v Speaker 2>They just came out in favor of a tax on </v>
<v Speaker 2>co two.</v>

1389
01:00:20.091 --> 01:00:20.924
<v Speaker 2>They've been promoting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think their policies are wrong in </v>

1390
01:00:22.821 --> 01:00:23.654
<v Speaker 2>the wrong direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can say anything they want in </v>

1391
01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:26.334
<v Speaker 2>certain,</v>

1392
01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>given too much away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know out of guilt sort of or whatever.</v>

1393
01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>What prompts you to anti humanist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 million guilted them into doing more</v>

1394
01:00:35.461 --> 01:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>than you would argue they should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done because you guys obviously none.</v>

1395
01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.353
<v Speaker 2>I mean they should have done none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but particularly given the balance of </v>

1396
01:00:42.781 --> 01:00:43.614
<v Speaker 2>funding already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're talking orders of </v>

1397
01:00:44.881 --> 01:00:45.714
<v Speaker 2>magnitude different amounts of funding </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the catastrophists versus any kind </v>

1398
01:00:49.111 --> 01:00:52.910
<v Speaker 2>of advocate of fossil fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they gave $100 million to Stanford's</v>

1399
01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.753
<v Speaker 2>climate program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$100 million for every calculation I've </v>

1400
01:00:55.921 --> 01:00:56.754
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a way more than they've given to </v>

1401
01:00:57.361 --> 01:00:58.194
<v Speaker 2>anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

1402
01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these think tanks,</v>

1403
01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:02.010
<v Speaker 2>these nonprofits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1404
01:01:02.011 --> 01:01:04.200
<v Speaker 2>I really admire a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met a lot of the people,</v>

1405
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:05.063
<v Speaker 2>I think they were really sincere and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a hell of a time getting </v>

1406
01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.360
<v Speaker 2>funding from any of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these companies.</v>

1407
01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:11.550
<v Speaker 2>I think the company should give them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need money.</v>

1408
01:01:11.551 --> 01:01:12.384
<v Speaker 2>I have a different kind of business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think they should be giving a lot </v>

1409
01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:17.760
<v Speaker 2>more money to fund opposition research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a fundamental thing in a free</v>

1410
01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:21.840
<v Speaker 2>society and a one key function of </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry is to,</v>

1411
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:24.930
<v Speaker 2>if the industry is being attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should fund opposition,</v>

1412
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:25.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1413
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:27.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even like,</v>

1414
01:01:27.241 --> 01:01:28.021
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1415
01:01:28.021 --> 01:01:29.880
<v Speaker 2>so if you even take the tobacco </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>

1416
01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:32.070
<v Speaker 2>the tobacco should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should fund research.</v>

1417
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:36.600
<v Speaker 2>What it shouldn't do is misrepresent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lie about the researcher fund fraud.</v>

1418
01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:37.860
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1419
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody,</v>

1420
01:01:39.001 --> 01:01:39.834
<v Speaker 2>let's say somebody was exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about tobacco </v>

1421
01:01:41.341 --> 01:01:42.210
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never spoke,</v>

1422
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.960
<v Speaker 2>but like let's say somebody was </v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggerating by a factor of four,</v>

1423
01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:49.320
<v Speaker 2>the damages of tobacco and you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do research,</v>

1424
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be legitimate.</v>

1425
01:01:51.391 --> 01:01:52.224
<v Speaker 2>So what my point is in a free society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to talk about </v>

1426
01:01:54.181 --> 01:01:57.510
<v Speaker 2>anything you want the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a marginal case.</v>

1427
01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:01.590
<v Speaker 2>This is a completely normal thing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to be able to talk about.</v>

1428
01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.740
<v Speaker 2>And it's really scary that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1429
01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.810
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people thinks is,</v>

1430
01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.653
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is on the democratic proposed </v>

1431
01:02:08.821 --> 01:02:10.020
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All hurt,</v>

1432
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton has to do with sign and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is part of their platform that,</v>

1433
01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.053
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what kind of stupid platform is it </v>

1434
01:02:16.291 --> 01:02:20.630
<v Speaker 2>to tell the executive branch to go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pro form source.</v>

1435
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.200
<v Speaker 2>We legislative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just bizarre.</v>

1436
01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:26.040
<v Speaker 2>But they're telling the executive branch</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go after specific companies.</v>

1437
01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:27.030
<v Speaker 2>That's their platform.</v>

1438
01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole other topic.</v>

1439
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:32.650
<v Speaker 1>What's going on with politics or </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive?</v>

1440
01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.790
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the regressives.</v>

1441
01:02:33.791 --> 01:02:34.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1442
01:02:34.191 --> 01:02:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I almost got through a show without </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying regressives there you go.</v>

1443
01:02:36.381 --> 01:02:37.214
<v Speaker 1>But so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what's happening here is that </v>

1444
01:02:39.651 --> 01:02:40.484
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of a bigger cultural thing </v>

1445
01:02:41.541 --> 01:02:42.374
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you were talking about this and </v>

1446
01:02:43.161 --> 01:02:45.110
<v Speaker 1>through the lens of fossil fuels and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff,</v>

1447
01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.560
<v Speaker 1>but there's just a sort of bigger thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I've really made this show</v>

1448
01:02:48.561 --> 01:02:49.394
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just about free speech and </v>

1449
01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:51.434
<v Speaker 1>that's why I keep talking about it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much because I think people don't </v>

1450
01:02:53.151 --> 01:02:54.230
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1451
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.303
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what you think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change and fossil fuels and </v>

1452
01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.190
<v Speaker 1>everything else that you've said here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

1453
01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:04.370
<v Speaker 1>that the real linchpin here is the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech stuff.</v>

1454
01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And I keep saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fear it,</v>

1455
01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.093
<v Speaker 1>the government coming lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fear that we're taking away from </v>

1456
01:03:08.931 --> 01:03:11.000
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're laying out a pretty good case</v>

1457
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>on the government side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's even,</v>

1458
01:03:12.821 --> 01:03:13.654
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1459
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean I imagine you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>like these,</v>

1460
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:19.440
<v Speaker 2>these comfort zones and safe spaces and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trigger warning</v>

1461
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.840
<v Speaker 1>and self censorship that we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>

1462
01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:26.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I graduated Duke in 2002 and it wasn't,</v>

1463
01:03:26.181 --> 01:03:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was bad then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't,</v>

1464
01:03:27.771 --> 01:03:28.604
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm actually almost got kicked </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of Duke for yelling at a guest </v>

1465
01:03:31.461 --> 01:03:32.294
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in general there weren't even those </v>

1466
01:03:34.641 --> 01:03:38.090
<v Speaker 2>terms said that this idea of thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>control the,</v>

1467
01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:38.953
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a relationship even even</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of private thought control that's </v>

1468
01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:42.734
<v Speaker 2>not directly coercive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where you basically make everybody </v>

1469
01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:48.770
<v Speaker 2>afraid to say anything about any </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial topic.</v>

1470
01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:49.873
<v Speaker 2>My guess is that makes people very </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with government thought </v>

1471
01:03:53.301 --> 01:03:54.120
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

1472
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1473
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:56.220
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1474
01:03:56.221 --> 01:03:56.880
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1475
01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.100
<v Speaker 1>we got to wrap up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what would be,</v>

1476
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.273
<v Speaker 1>give me your like one minute sort of if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted people that have heard this </v>

1477
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:05.041
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said,</v>

1478
01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.260
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never bought into any of this stuff,</v>

1479
01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1480
01:04:08.281 --> 01:04:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I like some of this with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1481
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.153
<v Speaker 1>what's the one minute push that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>give them to explore this a little bit </v>

1482
01:04:13.981 --> 01:04:16.890
<v Speaker 1>more beyond buying my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to talk about when I say</v>

1483
01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:17.220
<v Speaker 1>goodbye.</v>

1484
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an issue.</v>

1485
01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:20.040
<v Speaker 2>I usually bring up more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want,</v>

1486
01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:20.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this,</v>

1487
01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:24.990
<v Speaker 2>whenever we look at any issue in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1488
01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:25.853
<v Speaker 2>we are implicitly or explicitly saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is good because I define good this </v>

1489
01:04:30.421 --> 01:04:33.060
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always have an implicit definition of</v>

1490
01:04:33.061 --> 01:04:33.894
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether we're talking about climate or </v>

1491
01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:37.080
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuels or free speech or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my,</v>

1492
01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:37.914
<v Speaker 2>what I call my standard of value is </v>
<v Speaker 2>always I want to maximize human </v>

1493
01:04:41.431 --> 01:04:44.160
<v Speaker 2>flourishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think in our culture today,</v>

1494
01:04:44.161 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 2>the standard of value or were taught </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly with environmental issues,</v>

1495
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.340
<v Speaker 2>is we want to minimize human impact on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>

1496
01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.220
<v Speaker 2>So I want people to think whenever they </v>
<v Speaker 2>run into these issues,</v>

1497
01:04:53.221 --> 01:04:54.450
<v Speaker 2>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask themselves,</v>

1498
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:58.830
<v Speaker 2>is this thinker on the premise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximum human flourishing or are they on</v>

1499
01:04:58.831 --> 01:05:01.770
<v Speaker 2>the premise of minimum human impact?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think when you look at things,</v>

1500
01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:05.850
<v Speaker 2>whether it's organic food or GMO or </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate,</v>

1501
01:05:05.851 --> 01:05:08.670
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a lot of that minimum impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the ideal.</v>

1502
01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.060
<v Speaker 2>And I think that completely contradicts </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximizing human wellbeing.</v>

1503
01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:15.330
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to maximize flourishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to maximize,</v>

1504
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.193
<v Speaker 2>you want to minimize negative impacts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want to maximize positive </v>

1505
01:05:18.251 --> 01:05:20.230
<v Speaker 2>impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great filter to look at</v>

1506
01:05:20.231 --> 01:05:20.880
<v Speaker 2>life through.</v>

1507
01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1508
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfect closing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I should mention that you said to me</v>

1509
01:05:23.761 --> 01:05:25.800
<v Speaker 1>right before we started that one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>former guests,</v>

1510
01:05:25.801 --> 01:05:26.634
<v Speaker 1>Michael Mann,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a climate scientist I think at </v>

1511
01:05:27.631 --> 01:05:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Penn State Penn state or am I right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1512
01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he uh,</v>

1513
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:32.023
<v Speaker 1>he's blocked you on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I guess goes to a little bit of </v>

1514
01:05:33.991 --> 01:05:38.940
<v Speaker 1>just how contentious this whole thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you on musk is black to you too.</v>

1515
01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean w w w what was interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Mann,</v>

1516
01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:44.620
<v Speaker 2>I'd say when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when watch Michael man speak,</v>

1517
01:05:44.621 --> 01:05:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I encourage anyone to watch any of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>lectures.</v>

1518
01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen your interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen his lectures.</v>

1519
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.153
<v Speaker 2>We'll get the precision or non precision</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the issue of what is demonstrated </v>

1520
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:55.624
<v Speaker 2>versus what is speculated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what they tend to do is they'll </v>

1521
01:05:57.821 --> 01:05:58.654
<v Speaker 2>say something trivial like co two warms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which everyone agrees with and it'll </v>

1522
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.900
<v Speaker 2>jump into therefore it's catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just look at,</v>

1523
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.560
<v Speaker 2>is Michael Mann really respecting your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind?</v>

1524
01:06:07.561 --> 01:06:08.394
<v Speaker 2>Is He really explaining things with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of precision that would be </v>

1525
01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:12.640
<v Speaker 2>necessary for you to really understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the topic?</v>

1526
01:06:12.641 --> 01:06:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not asking you to take a position.</v>

1527
01:06:14.111 --> 01:06:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that people should think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

1528
01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.250
<v Speaker 2>And one indication is how they deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

1529
01:06:18.251 --> 01:06:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Now people can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't block people,</v>

1530
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:22.210
<v Speaker 2>other people that they can have their </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

1531
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:27.220
<v Speaker 2>But Michael Mann wrote a post that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex Epstein is the Koch Brothers attack</v>

1532
01:06:27.221 --> 01:06:30.640
<v Speaker 2>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which wouldn't be a negative thing in my</v>

1533
01:06:30.641 --> 01:06:32.650
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was bizarre.</v>

1534
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not true and nobody's funding me at</v>

1535
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:36.160
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1536
01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:39.340
<v Speaker 2>and he just made it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just completely made it up.</v>

1537
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:40.203
<v Speaker 2>The idea what he didn't engage my </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument and then I said something to </v>

1538
01:06:43.361 --> 01:06:46.660
<v Speaker 2>the effect of this is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is your evidence?</v>

1539
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:48.290
<v Speaker 2>And then he blocked you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:49.203
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what you see there is that when </v>

1541
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:52.840
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there are two types of,</v>

1542
01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:53.674
<v Speaker 2>I think having the moral high ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is when you have a real confidence </v>

1543
01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:59.170
<v Speaker 2>and that's when you're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain your views to people.</v>

1544
01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:00.243
<v Speaker 2>And the others where you have a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>societal status where it's not really </v>

1545
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:04.023
<v Speaker 2>earned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's considered you dominate the </v>

1546
01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:08.070
<v Speaker 2>politically correct version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1547
01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:09.203
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the political correctness at </v>

1548
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:13.030
<v Speaker 2>this point in time in society.</v>

1549
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.820
<v Speaker 2>And when people have that kind of pseudo</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral authority,</v>

1550
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.810
<v Speaker 2>they do all sorts of irrational things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when somebody acts like they have the</v>

1551
01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:20.644
<v Speaker 2>moral high ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think seeing if they're really a </v>

1552
01:07:22.211 --> 01:07:26.230
<v Speaker 2>debater or whether they just want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictate to you that's or,</v>

1553
01:07:26.231 --> 01:07:28.060
<v Speaker 2>or ignore you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good test.</v>

1554
01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1555
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.350
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why people really </v>
<v Speaker 2>value this show is,</v>

1556
01:07:32.351 --> 01:07:34.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not an unconfident gile though.</v>

1557
01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're interviewing people,</v>

1558
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1559
01:07:37.331 --> 01:07:41.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain confidence and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to discuss things with anyone.</v>

1560
01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:43.690
<v Speaker 2>And there's a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very reveleigh Tori,</v>

1561
01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:44.763
<v Speaker 2>when people are not willing to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and their number one talking </v>

1562
01:07:47.231 --> 01:07:48.680
<v Speaker 2>point is there's nothing to discuss.</v>

1563
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1564
01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I always find it funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that I never felt,</v>

1565
01:07:52.561 --> 01:07:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I've never in my life felt the need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be right all the time.</v>

1566
01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.153
<v Speaker 1>And everyone I feel in the public space </v>
<v Speaker 1>always wants to prove how right they </v>

1567
01:07:59.011 --> 01:07:59.844
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm completely fine having this </v>

1568
01:08:01.771 --> 01:08:02.604
<v Speaker 1>conversation and maybe I would look back</v>
<v Speaker 1>now on my interview with Michael Mann </v>

1569
01:08:05.491 --> 01:08:06.324
<v Speaker 1>and sort of look at through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a bit of a lens of what you've </v>

1570
01:08:08.401 --> 01:08:09.234
<v Speaker 1>just said there and maybe a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have him on again where I would </v>

1571
01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:11.970
<v Speaker 1>push him on some of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1572
01:08:11.971 --> 01:08:14.310
<v Speaker 1>well that's the conversation I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have and that's why we did it.</v>

1573
01:08:14.311 --> 01:08:15.144
<v Speaker 1>So you can get Alex's book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moral case for fossil fuels and </v>

1574
01:08:19.791 --> 01:08:20.624
<v Speaker 1>check out industrial progress.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>the link for the book is right down </v>

1575
01:08:23.271 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

1576
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>And we'll do it again next week.</v>
