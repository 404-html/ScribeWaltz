1
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a panel today and joining me</v>

2
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>is old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grizzled Rubin Report Veteran and author</v>

3
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>of heavens on Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer and new returning champ.</v>

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving you a returning champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read before you've even sat down here </v>

5
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>once author of the new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political tribes,</v>

6
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Amy Chu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how are you?</v>

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well thank you guys for coming in.</v>

9
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:33.441
<v Speaker 1>And Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you set this up so I'm going to not let </v>

10
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>you speak for just a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you said up,</v>

11
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>you said the three of us should sit down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talk about a whole slew of issues,</v>

12
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>but amy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so my audience can get to know you </v>

13
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>a little bit since they know a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael already.</v>

14
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Just give me a two minute synopsis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are before we talk about the </v>

15
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>book and why.</v>

16
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

17
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Yale law professor.</v>

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

19
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm principally by about foreign policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and democracy and ethnic conflict.</v>

20
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly developing countries.</v>

21
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I teach at Yale Law School in 2011.</v>

22
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 2>Something crazy happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 2>and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote in three months a memoir that I </v>

24
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.441
<v Speaker 2>thought was going to be really funny and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was called battle hymn of the tiger </v>

25
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Speaker 2>mother and the world exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I created an international firestorm.</v>

26
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Everybody hated me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got death threats.</v>

27
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 2>It was sort of just at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people going bananas on twitter to </v>

28
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't have those tools.</v>

29
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:33.451
<v Speaker 2>I had no social media tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't on facebook and I was just </v>

30
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.590
<v Speaker 2>caught off guard and I became known as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the notorious Tiger mother.</v>

31
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 2>And so in some ways this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

32
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.910
<v Speaker 2>this new book is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

33
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got sick of only being known as the </v>

34
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 2>tiger moth.</v>

35
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I was on a TV show talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukrainian nationalism,</v>

36
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 2>which I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know about nationalism,</v>

37
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:53.971
<v Speaker 2>I've written about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And afterwards I saw the twitter feed </v>

38
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:56.611
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does this woman that's tiger woman </v>

39
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:56.611
<v Speaker 2>thinks that she can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalism?</v>

40
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 2>So like I did have a career before he </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

41
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 2>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

42
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:05.341
<v Speaker 2>I've lost control of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a way the new book goes back to </v>

43
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:05.800
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I actually know a little bit about.</v>

44
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to go on the record as </v>

45
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 2>saying that as I am sitting next to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiger mom,</v>

46
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I feel an undue pressure to do this show</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>

47
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Normally I can phone it in when I assure</v>
<v Speaker 2>him here,</v>

48
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.220
<v Speaker 2>but I feel a little extra credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Book is actually about my younger </v>

49
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Speaker 2>daughter rebelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge book about.</v>

50
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a rebellion but you'd like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

51
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 2>The whole book is so wildly </v>
<v Speaker 2>misunderstood,</v>

52
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been.</v>

53
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 2>It's been fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>You do want to talk a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>some tiger mom stuff towards the end </v>

55
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's some interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>things happening right now that we all </v>

56
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.820
<v Speaker 1>kind of need a little bit more of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps then the outrage machine thought</v>

57
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Michael,</v>

58
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:47.751
<v Speaker 1>why did you think that this would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good group to sit down together when he </v>

59
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>sent me that email now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:53.481
<v Speaker 1>because the book kind of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes kind of set me back a little bit </v>

61
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:56.841
<v Speaker 1>in the sense that I've kind of had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifelong mission of spreading science </v>

62
00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:56.841
<v Speaker 1>and reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical thinking,</v>

63
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>and then after I'm reading</v>

64
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.400
<v Speaker 3>pinker's book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better angels that inspired me to </v>

65
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 3>write the moral arc and and kind of go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into this other direction of spreading,</v>

66
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 3>not just science reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>critical thinking,</v>

67
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:13.531
<v Speaker 3>but liberal democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>market capitalism and other social tools</v>

68
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 3>that can be measured in the same way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that scientific things can be measured.</v>

69
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:24.031
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I like about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve's work is that he as a social </v>

70
00:03:24.031 --> 00:03:28.831
<v Speaker 3>scientist tries to tease out what are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the causal variables that are </v>

71
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 3>influencing people to do this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

72
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 3>can we tilt the incentives to get people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be less violent by doing this?</v>

73
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Rather than that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

74
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Like any scientist would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and so this idea,</v>

75
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.170
<v Speaker 3>and I'd read all this literature about </v>
<v Speaker 3>spreading democracy is a good thing and </v>

76
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 3>spreading capitalism is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

77
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

78
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.270
<v Speaker 3>but as you show him political tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not quite as simple as I like to </v>

79
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.320
<v Speaker 3>think in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we could just go to all these places </v>

80
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 3>around the world and bringing liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy,</v>

81
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.700
<v Speaker 3>bring a market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism freedom and prosperity,</v>

82
00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 3>you will prosper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's quite.</v>

83
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 3>We'll have this global community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is where I'd like to go.</v>

84
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:10.501
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at some point we're going to be a </v>

85
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 3>multiplanetary species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't be fighting these little tribal</v>

86
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:12.690
<v Speaker 3>battles on Mars or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

87
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.750
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually I think we might end up </v>

88
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 3>doing that if you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in fact these tribal tendencies are</v>

89
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 3>pretty deep,</v>

90
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like these things too.</v>

91
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 2>I love democracy and liberalism at </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital,</v>

92
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 2>these enlightenment principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

93
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.390
<v Speaker 2>but there's sort of no natural reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they should have ethnically neutral</v>

94
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Speaker 2>implications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

95
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.660
<v Speaker 2>So democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>at some day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

97
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a global democracy,</v>

98
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:42.540
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes perfect sense that democracy is</v>

99
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:45.960
<v Speaker 2>going to empower the majority group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one with the bigger numbers.</v>

100
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.260
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a number that's very </v>

101
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.260
<v Speaker 2>scientific actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

102
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.531
<v Speaker 2>but similarly markets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is when I coined the term market </v>

103
00:04:54.531 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 2>dominant minority in 2003.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

104
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.790
<v Speaker 2>we all started in different places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just free market capitalism,</v>

105
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 2>even though it's fair in many ways by </v>
<v Speaker 2>equal,</v>

106
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 2>you could argue that or we can have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge debate,</v>

107
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.620
<v Speaker 2>but there's no real logical reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>at any given point in a given society </v>

108
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.391
<v Speaker 2>that though that free markets will </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit all ethnic or racial or all </v>

109
00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:18.120
<v Speaker 2>class are all religious groups equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once you acknowledge that you,</v>

110
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.160
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have these transition questions.</v>

111
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.470
<v Speaker 1>So I thought maybe we should then with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in mind,</v>

112
00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:27.471
<v Speaker 1>start with something that's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening right now that might help </v>

113
00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:29.490
<v Speaker 1>people frame a little bit of what all </v>
<v Speaker 1>three of our political positions are.</v>

114
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we've,</v>

115
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I think the first time I had you on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point you had said you're a </v>

116
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.621
<v Speaker 1>libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've also kind of said you're </v>

117
00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:39.630
<v Speaker 1>a classical liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you've kind of said enough with the</v>

118
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:44.631
<v Speaker 1>labels altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself a classical liberal </v>

119
00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:45.160
<v Speaker 1>tee shirt on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you,</v>

120
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you in the classical liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>tee shirt.</v>

121
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:49.770
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course everyone knows that I consider</v>

122
00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:53.010
<v Speaker 1>myself a classical liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely like a lot of the ideas</v>

123
00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:55.680
<v Speaker 1>of libertarianism and I'm always sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>more drawn to that.</v>

124
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>If we were to put a label on just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start</v>

125
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.460
<v Speaker 2>before I get into the specific issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely not a classical liberal </v>

126
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love classical liberals.</v>

127
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

128
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that one of the things I pointed</v>
<v Speaker 2>out in my book is that a lot of people </v>

129
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 2>are tribal who don't think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

130
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>So if he liberal cosmopolitans </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment people,</v>

131
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.090
<v Speaker 2>you think of yourself as the opposite of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pride because that was,</v>

132
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.740
<v Speaker 2>came out of the alignment on anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious warfare.</v>

133
00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:28.741
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is where we are now </v>

134
00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:28.780
<v Speaker 2>in America or even the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

135
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 2>it be a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cosmopolitan is actually a pretty hard </v>

136
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 2>trying to get into my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

137
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:39.101
<v Speaker 2>you were very judgey tribe and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably met a lot of different kinds of</v>

138
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 2>people to be so cosmopolitan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

139
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very struck and shamed myself.</v>

140
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 2>I'd have a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm poor white person from the south who</v>

141
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.930
<v Speaker 2>had never been on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

142
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.840
<v Speaker 2>and that was actually kind of startling </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we,</v>

143
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 2>the first question some professor was </v>
<v Speaker 2>asking,</v>

144
00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 2>so I think that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like writing about tribalism because </v>

145
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm very aware of its effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm the child of immigrant parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm very proud of my ethnic </v>

147
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

148
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also love this idea of America as </v>

149
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 2>this umbrella,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

150
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

151
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that it's a complicated answer,</v>

152
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I guess as a real,</v>

153
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real liberals don't have an account of </v>

154
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 2>why even have the nation state that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>how far you want to go down.</v>

155
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So patriotism and all this stuff.</v>

156
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:28.540
<v Speaker 2>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presumably that's,</v>

157
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.990
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's at best a transitional thing for </v>

158
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:33.990
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

159
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I don't go so far.</v>

160
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 2>It depends how far you want to go down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the road of freedom depending on how you</v>

161
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 2>find me a classical liberal ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is some utility in the state.</v>

162
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.270
<v Speaker 2>We just have to figure out what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would want it to be the lightest </v>

163
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 2>touch possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just to answer it in one,</v>

164
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 2>what I really am as I am somebody that </v>
<v Speaker 2>loves about America,</v>

165
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:55.390
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

166
00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's very unique that this is a </v>

167
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 2>country that at once has a very strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective national identity or at least</v>

168
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.970
<v Speaker 2>did we can get to that and secondly </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows individual subgroup or tribal </v>

169
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:07.880
<v Speaker 2>identities to flourish.</v>

170
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Like you can be an Irish American or I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>Korean American,</v>

171
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I make classic liberal and possibly </v>

172
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.710
<v Speaker 2>be very patriotic at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a very unique thing about</v>

173
00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 2>this country and that we're in danger of</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing that kind of magic formula.</v>

174
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:27.431
<v Speaker 2>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think you just described the </v>

175
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:27.431
<v Speaker 2>melting pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

176
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that the secret sauce?</v>

177
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I melting pot suggests that everybody </v>

178
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.801
<v Speaker 2>loses their identity like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that happened very </v>

179
00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 2>successfully with a lot of the northern </v>
<v Speaker 2>European immigrants,</v>

180
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 2>but we've never really been a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>melting pot.</v>

181
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Like if you take the African American </v>
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>

182
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 2>there've been many discrete groups that </v>
<v Speaker 2>never melted into that pot.</v>

183
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:49.130
<v Speaker 2>So I think part of it is a melting pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some assimilation for sure,</v>

184
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 2>but I think this common identity thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

185
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 2>can coexist with a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of diversity.</v>

186
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Some might be closer to the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of mosaic thing.</v>

187
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do really believe that you need </v>

188
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 2>this connective tissue telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

189
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>So I guess it depends what analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whether it's melting pot or mosaic </v>

190
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.681
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've basically done </v>

191
00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:12.200
<v Speaker 1>multiculturalism better than pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>

192
00:09:12.201 --> 00:09:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean</v>

193
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.840
<v Speaker 3>that's where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

194
00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:17.080
<v Speaker 3>So the balance here is how can I </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain that,</v>

195
00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:19.180
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my local group identity,</v>

196
00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:24.181
<v Speaker 3>which is easy to do because I identify </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people that look like me or live </v>

197
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:26.140
<v Speaker 3>near me or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's totally natural and still respect</v>

198
00:09:26.141 --> 00:09:30.850
<v Speaker 3>others because there's some umbrella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there previously when I was younger,</v>

199
00:09:30.851 --> 00:09:31.420
<v Speaker 3>I would have thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

200
00:09:31.421 --> 00:09:33.370
<v Speaker 3>we don't need a government government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

201
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 3>this can happen just from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've become a little more cynical about </v>

202
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 3>human nature being dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

203
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:42.670
<v Speaker 3>in tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sense that at some point you need</v>

204
00:09:42.671 --> 00:09:46.510
<v Speaker 3>some kind of rules to govern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say the marketplace to a certain extent,</v>

205
00:09:46.511 --> 00:09:49.630
<v Speaker 3>at least steer it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why this,</v>

206
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.410
<v Speaker 3>this cake baking thing is I just go back</v>
<v Speaker 3>and forth.</v>

207
00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:54.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

208
00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:54.460
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

209
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.420
<v Speaker 3>she should be able to bake any cake he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants.</v>

210
00:09:56.421 --> 00:10:01.421
<v Speaker 3>We're not in the battle days when people</v>
<v Speaker 3>justified racism and know lunch counters</v>

211
00:10:03.281 --> 00:10:08.281
<v Speaker 3>and buses segregated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at some point it took the federal </v>

212
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:11.671
<v Speaker 3>government saying we're sending the </v>
<v Speaker 3>troops in to set to integrate your </v>

213
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:14.470
<v Speaker 3>schools even though they're down there </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Alabama saying segregation forever.</v>

214
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.480
<v Speaker 3>At some point sometimes you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to use force to get people at </v>

215
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:20.480
<v Speaker 3>least to start</v>

216
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:20.630
<v Speaker 1>to bring them around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

217
00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:25.631
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is the one issue that I wanted </v>

218
00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:25.631
<v Speaker 1>to do up top before we dive into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

219
00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:28.160
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted out when when the decision was</v>

220
00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:31.580
<v Speaker 1>made that basically my feeling is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to offer.</v>

221
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.390
<v Speaker 1>We have the civil rights act of 1964.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to re litigate it.</v>

222
00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:39.110
<v Speaker 1>You have to offer products to every </v>
<v Speaker 1>person regardless of race,</v>

223
00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:40.610
<v Speaker 1>color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creed and all of that stuff.</v>

224
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.880
<v Speaker 1>But that if there is a specific artistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality to it or a customization to it </v>

225
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.620
<v Speaker 1>and that happens to go against your </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs that you just don't have to do </v>

226
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.240
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether I think that's abhorrent or not,</v>

227
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't ask a,</v>

228
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.930
<v Speaker 1>a satanist wouldn't be allowed to walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a Muslim baker and say paint,</v>

229
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put my helmet on the cake.</v>

230
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:06.670
<v Speaker 1>No one in their right mind I think would</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that that's the government's job </v>

231
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:06.980
<v Speaker 1>to force the baker to do that.</v>

232
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.220
<v Speaker 2>There's always do when we teach this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>start spitting out the hypothetical.</v>

233
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.750
<v Speaker 2>That makes complete sense what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they say,</v>

234
00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>I think Justice Kagan might have asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>how about a makeup artist,</v>

235
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can a make up artist refused to,</v>

236
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.380
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to provide services to,</v>

237
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to gay people to,</v>

238
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.540
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once you start pressing what counts </v>

239
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.811
<v Speaker 2>as being an artist for photography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>photography is a form of art or.</v>

240
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is the</v>

241
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.560
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

242
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.570
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so go grocery store bagging right the </v>

243
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:41.570
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of a mundane task.</v>

244
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.190
<v Speaker 1>We all go to the grocery to buy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>products that are there and they're,</v>

245
00:11:43.191 --> 00:11:45.690
<v Speaker 1>all they have to do is put it in the bag</v>
<v Speaker 1>and walk out if a,</v>

246
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.750
<v Speaker 1>if a grocer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're saying we're not going to bag </v>

247
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.530
<v Speaker 1>groceries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>groceries for black people,</v>

248
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.690
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is actually in violation of the </v>

249
00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:57.690
<v Speaker 1>1964 civil liberties act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

250
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.910
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that we would force a </v>

251
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:03.610
<v Speaker 1>specific product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't want a,</v>

252
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:08.660
<v Speaker 1>a Jewish painter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't have to be forced to take </v>

253
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.371
<v Speaker 1>commissions from a Neo Nazi or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted out several other examples on </v>

254
00:12:11.371 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your fear basically where I think we</v>

255
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:16.440
<v Speaker 1>don't quite see eye to eye is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>

256
00:12:16.441 --> 00:12:18.800
<v Speaker 1>if we don't do some of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that things will devolve</v>

257
00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.000
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that fair to say?</v>

258
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be right that in,</v>

259
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 3>in 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not 1964,</v>

260
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:28.930
<v Speaker 3>so maybe we don't need such draconian </v>
<v Speaker 3>laws historically when you.</v>

261
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.600
<v Speaker 3>But also we needed those lows to reverse</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim crow laws,</v>

262
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 3>which don't exist in the battle days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You needed to send the federal troops </v>

263
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.870
<v Speaker 3>into this to integrate the schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we don't need to do that now.</v>

264
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this one baker out of 100 will </v>
<v Speaker 3>refuse to bake a cake.</v>

265
00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 3>But as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the justices pointed out,</v>

266
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna protect,</v>

267
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:55.321
<v Speaker 3>this guy's really just expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it turns out that every other </v>

268
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 3>baker refusing to bake cakes for blacks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and gays and so on,</v>

269
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 3>then that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can't let that happen.</v>

270
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:01.600
<v Speaker 3>That may never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

271
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.710
<v Speaker 3>What do you make of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of the decision that struck me is </v>

272
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 3>like a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like kind of slimy way out of this.</v>

273
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

274
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.950
<v Speaker 3>you're the law professor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know why they did that.</v>

275
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

276
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.390
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as everybody says,</v>

277
00:13:14.391 --> 00:13:19.391
<v Speaker 2>it's an extremely narrow holding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a pundit just said that this </v>

278
00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:23.231
<v Speaker 2>particular commission was displaying </v>
<v Speaker 2>hostility to religion in a way that </v>

279
00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:23.480
<v Speaker 2>couldn't make them impartial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

280
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that will be another decision.</v>

281
00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:28.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way it's just kind of kicked down,</v>

282
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:33.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seemed like it had no teeth in </v>

283
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:33.250
<v Speaker 2>that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was like,</v>

284
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:33.250
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

285
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was an unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding,</v>

286
00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:37.070
<v Speaker 2>but I do think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just avoided the question.</v>

287
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

288
00:13:38.301 --> 00:13:39.050
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

289
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.130
<v Speaker 2>I think is what worries me right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the constitution was supposed to be the </v>

290
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:49.061
<v Speaker 2>vaccine that sort of what protected </v>
<v Speaker 2>against political tribalism and I know </v>

291
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:53.001
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I see that's kind of dangerous </v>

292
00:13:53.001 --> 00:13:53.990
<v Speaker 2>and dismaying and the twitter feed right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now is that,</v>

293
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like tribalism as attacking of the </v>

294
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 2>constitution to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

295
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.070
<v Speaker 2>it's not just something that we disagree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

296
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's like there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonization of the other side.</v>

297
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

298
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.690
<v Speaker 2>if you teach the law school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not a con law professor,</v>

299
00:14:08.691 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 2>that's not my area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I teach contracts and you know,</v>

300
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.840
<v Speaker 2>international business transactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one thing you know is there are hard</v>

301
00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:17.510
<v Speaker 2>cases and this is a hard case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

302
00:14:17.511 --> 00:14:22.511
<v Speaker 2>You will have print multiple principals </v>
<v Speaker 2>are different rights clashing or weird </v>

303
00:14:22.511 --> 00:14:26.741
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what would I think is almost more </v>

304
00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:27.500
<v Speaker 2>scary is you see people on the two sides</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

305
00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:32.501
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you think that a baker </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be allowed to refuse to bake a </v>

306
00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:37.760
<v Speaker 2>cake celebrating gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're a bigot and homophobe.</v>

307
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

308
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.250
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the other side there,</v>

309
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.050
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the it,</v>

310
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.460
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are take the other view,</v>

311
00:14:46.461 --> 00:14:51.461
<v Speaker 2>then you are declaring jihad on Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian values and this is the is so </v>

312
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:54.160
<v Speaker 2>ratched up and it's not good.</v>

313
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I think the main takeaway is spend less </v>
<v Speaker 1>time on twitter.</v>

314
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
<v Speaker 1>People are normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that that actually is part of it </v>

315
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.350
<v Speaker 1>because if you talk to average people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not not average.</v>

316
00:15:05.351 --> 00:15:10.351
<v Speaker 1>People don't even like that phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you talked to the neighbor and </v>

317
00:15:10.351 --> 00:15:11.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone else in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't behave the way they behave on</v>

318
00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:16.831
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemingly has taken a hold of our </v>

319
00:15:16.831 --> 00:15:18.520
<v Speaker 1>entire national discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you this then,</v>

320
00:15:18.521 --> 00:15:20.710
<v Speaker 1>because I do think most of these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>become local.</v>

321
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:26.010
<v Speaker 1>If there was a baker that did not want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to to bake a cake for a for Chinese </v>

322
00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:34.981
<v Speaker 1>people or a whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you feel is the right thing to</v>

323
00:15:35.141 --> 00:15:35.290
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

324
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a personal thing.</v>

325
00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:40.190
<v Speaker 2>I would just go to a different bakery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I wanted to.</v>

326
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:45.191
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to make it personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's even saying that doesn't mean </v>

327
00:15:45.191 --> 00:15:45.680
<v Speaker 2>that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

328
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 2>disrespect somebody else that did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really just my approach to life,</v>

329
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:50.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

330
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:55.901
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wouldn't want that wedding </v>

331
00:15:55.901 --> 00:15:55.901
<v Speaker 2>cake.</v>

332
00:15:55.901 --> 00:15:57.280
<v Speaker 1>What is it that the only way really to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect freedom,</v>

333
00:15:57.281 --> 00:16:02.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean the freedoms that we have here is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your decision to either do something </v>

334
00:16:02.281 --> 00:16:06.211
<v Speaker 1>or not do something or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or go to a business or not go to a </v>

335
00:16:06.211 --> 00:16:06.211
<v Speaker 1>business or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

336
00:16:06.211 --> 00:16:10.050
<v Speaker 1>the only real way to broadly protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom is that it's Kinda Shitty,</v>

337
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

338
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.490
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel great</v>

339
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.760
<v Speaker 2>and it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't need the laws now because we </v>

340
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.161
<v Speaker 2>have social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People shun that Baker on social media </v>

341
00:16:20.161 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not go to that store or if that's </v>

342
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 2>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do give them your,</v>

343
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.330
<v Speaker 2>your business is that the market sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts it out.</v>

344
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.740
<v Speaker 2>That mismatch your point about the civil</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights and needing force initially,</v>

345
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.350
<v Speaker 2>like where do you get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we get these?</v>

346
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.420
<v Speaker 2>We didn't end slavery by by market </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces.</v>

347
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:40.470
<v Speaker 2>We took a walk and sometimes you allow a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of people to do this.</v>

348
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Can you get an regressive norm change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you think about human</v>

349
00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:48.940
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm similar to you.</v>

350
00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I believe my journal going back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

351
00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.640
<v Speaker 1>well I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say I'm a world weary optimist </v>

352
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 1>that it's the only way that I could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this the way that I do it,</v>

353
00:17:00.801 --> 00:17:02.170
<v Speaker 1>but I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

354
00:17:02.171 --> 00:17:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not calling for reversing,</v>

355
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:07.250
<v Speaker 1>but just to be very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying we should be litigated or</v>

356
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:12.251
<v Speaker 1>reverse the civil rights act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that we need that in 2018 </v>

357
00:17:12.251 --> 00:17:17.231
<v Speaker 1>so that people aren't opening up white </v>
<v Speaker 1>only businesses or anti gay businesses </v>

358
00:17:17.231 --> 00:17:21.251
<v Speaker 1>or bowling alleys that aren't for trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are giving you a couple other </v>

359
00:17:21.251 --> 00:17:21.251
<v Speaker 1>good ones here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

360
00:17:21.251 --> 00:17:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Roller Skating rinks.</v>

361
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.430
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to the political situation.</v>

362
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:32.460
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some differences in America </v>

363
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.880
<v Speaker 2>today because I studied American </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

364
00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:38.881
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what I've been looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the last hundred years and because </v>

365
00:17:38.881 --> 00:17:40.390
<v Speaker 2>of these big demographic changes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're having now,</v>

366
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:45.460
<v Speaker 2>so-called what with whites about to on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the verge of no longer being a majority </v>

367
00:17:46.001 --> 00:17:48.010
<v Speaker 2>in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about 15 years.</v>

368
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.270
<v Speaker 2>The numbers from 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>44 to 2050.</v>

369
00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:53.370
<v Speaker 2>And then there are debates about whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the big had happened,</v>

370
00:17:53.371 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 2>but most people can see that even in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>

371
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:57.580
<v Speaker 2>in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already happened.</v>

372
00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

373
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 2>the study's kind of show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

374
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.870
<v Speaker 2>this is going to sound terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for most of this country's history,</v>

375
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 2>it was dominated economically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>

376
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:12.471
<v Speaker 2>and culturally by a white majority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the result of that is lots of bad </v>

377
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:17.631
<v Speaker 2>things could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a little room for </v>

378
00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:19.821
<v Speaker 2>generosity and it's a little right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this demographic change about to </v>

379
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

380
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I write in the book is that every </v>

381
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:26.450
<v Speaker 2>group feels threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

382
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:30.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the minorities felt </v>

383
00:18:30.501 --> 00:18:30.501
<v Speaker 2>threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whitesfeld threatened,</v>

384
00:18:30.501 --> 00:18:30.501
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latinos,</v>

385
00:18:30.501 --> 00:18:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Asians feel threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.020
<v Speaker 2>with the me too movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men feel threatened,</v>

387
00:18:34.021 --> 00:18:35.990
<v Speaker 2>women feel threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straighten it.</v>

388
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:41.150
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's when people felt threatened </v>

389
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 2>that they retreat into tribalism and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>more US versus them.</v>

390
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 2>So on this Baker thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.860
<v Speaker 2>you just never know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're,</v>

392
00:18:45.861 --> 00:18:50.861
<v Speaker 2>we're at a funny moment right now with </v>
<v Speaker 2>are candidates running on like white </v>

393
00:18:50.861 --> 00:18:55.790
<v Speaker 2>nationalist platforms in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't like in the last 50 years or </v>

394
00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:55.790
<v Speaker 2>openly at least.</v>

395
00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

396
00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

397
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.050
<v Speaker 1>so granting you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I would say then is that if</v>

398
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:06.051
<v Speaker 1>that's all true and we maybe are about </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get much more tribal and start seeing</v>

399
00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:11.151
<v Speaker 1>more outward racism and the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that perhaps even if we allowed those </v>

400
00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:14.130
<v Speaker 1>businesses to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your answer is still the right one.</v>

401
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 1>The answer of use social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use your influence,</v>

402
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:22.341
<v Speaker 1>use your dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't live in a state or a town that is </v>

403
00:19:22.341 --> 00:19:26.091
<v Speaker 1>supporting these things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The experiment should still go on with </v>

404
00:19:26.091 --> 00:19:27.900
<v Speaker 1>the least amount of government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I get why this is.</v>

405
00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

406
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:34.230
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you brought that up in the book </v>

407
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.230
<v Speaker 3>about everybody feels personally as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist,</v>

408
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm always amazed when he's born again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians go,</v>

409
00:19:35.831 --> 00:19:38.470
<v Speaker 3>we are a persecuted minority in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

410
00:19:38.471 --> 00:19:39.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>

411
00:19:39.281 --> 00:19:44.281
<v Speaker 3>Nine out of 10 of you were around me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the person that we really feel </v>

412
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.920
<v Speaker 3>that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

413
00:19:47.921 --> 00:19:49.130
<v Speaker 3>I live in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not so bad.</v>

414
00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.060
<v Speaker 3>But when I travel it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

415
00:19:52.061 --> 00:19:54.670
<v Speaker 3>well I am really in the minority here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but two,</v>

416
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.970
<v Speaker 3>two quick things on sometimes the need </v>
<v Speaker 3>for government for us,</v>

417
00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:03.210
<v Speaker 3>like the burning of widows in India.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was ended by the British </v>

418
00:20:03.671 --> 00:20:06.730
<v Speaker 3>colonialists that said you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop doing this or else.</v>

419
00:20:06.731 --> 00:20:08.530
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to respect our culture.</v>

420
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.610
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

421
00:20:09.611 --> 00:20:11.320
<v Speaker 3>here's our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you burn women,</v>

422
00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:16.321
<v Speaker 3>we build gallows and paying you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you go ahead and build your funeral </v>

423
00:20:16.321 --> 00:20:20.821
<v Speaker 3>pyres and we're going to build our </v>
<v Speaker 3>gallows and we can respect each other's </v>

424
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:20.821
<v Speaker 3>goals.</v>

425
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:21.880
<v Speaker 3>And that put an end to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in Papa New Guinea,</v>

426
00:20:21.881 --> 00:20:24.370
<v Speaker 3>jared diamond tells this story about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

427
00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.050
<v Speaker 3>rates of violence A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

428
00:20:26.051 --> 00:20:30.550
<v Speaker 3>it was like a hundreds of times more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the natural background,</v>

429
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.120
<v Speaker 3>but rates of violence even in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties and no one liked the violence,</v>

430
00:20:34.121 --> 00:20:36.700
<v Speaker 3>but it was just the result of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>little local tribes.</v>

431
00:20:36.701 --> 00:20:40.420
<v Speaker 3>And finally the overall government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they got some power,</v>

432
00:20:40.421 --> 00:20:40.990
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

433
00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.860
<v Speaker 3>no more violence if you kill somebody at</v>
<v Speaker 3>a vengeance or whatever.</v>

434
00:20:44.861 --> 00:20:49.861
<v Speaker 3>He took your pig and so whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna put you in jail and we're </v>

435
00:20:49.861 --> 00:20:50.550
<v Speaker 3>gonna lock you up and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

436
00:20:50.551 --> 00:20:51.240
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

437
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 3>but most people were happy about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jared said,</v>

438
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God somebody came in,</v>

439
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.450
<v Speaker 3>the parent came in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop fighting.</v>

440
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I would say we don't live in</v>

441
00:21:00.361 --> 00:21:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Papa New Guinea and you don't live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>British colonial India.</v>

442
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Maybe more of a local example would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>in sports,</v>

443
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 3>like insightly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My sport,</v>

444
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.180
<v Speaker 3>most cyclists don't want a dope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's an escalating like the game </v>

445
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.961
<v Speaker 3>theory escalation thing where if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think everybody else's dope and you got </v>

446
00:21:18.961 --> 00:21:20.860
<v Speaker 3>to do it and what they really want is </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody on top say,</v>

447
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:26.130
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no more doping and we're going to test </v>

448
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:26.130
<v Speaker 3>because they don't really want a dope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they feel they have to dope.</v>

449
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.830
<v Speaker 3>So you need some kind of structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So stop cheating stuff,</v>

450
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.030
<v Speaker 3>kill Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to cheat,</v>

451
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:36.031
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so you've got to tilt the incentive </v>

452
00:21:36.031 --> 00:21:36.031
<v Speaker 3>somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hate to say it,</v>

453
00:21:36.031 --> 00:21:38.560
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes that has to come from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>top down a little bit.</v>

454
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting.</v>

455
00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:46.231
<v Speaker 1>So right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your book is called political tribes </v>

456
00:21:46.231 --> 00:21:46.231
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

457
00:21:46.231 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a believer in the individual.</v>

458
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:52.471
<v Speaker 1>I think that the individual is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to stop bigotry and prejudice and</v>

459
00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:56.530
<v Speaker 1>all of those things because you won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at someone as the member of a group</v>

460
00:21:56.531 --> 00:22:01.531
<v Speaker 1>and you owe black people think this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim people think or gay people think </v>

461
00:22:01.531 --> 00:22:04.801
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the individual will wait </v>

462
00:22:04.801 --> 00:22:06.680
<v Speaker 1>until you know what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sell me on the value of tribes.</v>

463
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

464
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.190
<v Speaker 1>the reality of</v>

465
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.410
<v Speaker 2>tribes grabbed reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm closer to it.</v>

466
00:22:11.411 --> 00:22:16.411
<v Speaker 2>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we all need a big dose of </v>

467
00:22:16.411 --> 00:22:18.050
<v Speaker 2>individuals in this country right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I teach on the college campus and I,</v>

468
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

469
00:22:19.341 --> 00:22:20.860
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're supposed to be famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

470
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 2>White America is a bunch of Mavericks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all,</v>

471
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think these things are </v>

472
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:29.640
<v Speaker 2>inconsistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do say that human beings,</v>

473
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.391
<v Speaker 2>and this is not a me saying it first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but human beings are just biologically </v>

474
00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:36.050
<v Speaker 2>tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to belong to groups.</v>

475
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are very,</v>

476
00:22:37.451 --> 00:22:39.960
<v Speaker 2>very few hermits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There can be individualistic,</v>

477
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 2>but there are not hermits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even monks to orders,</v>

478
00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:45.700
<v Speaker 2>they compete with each other.</v>

479
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's very few sort of jd </v>

480
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:50.720
<v Speaker 1>salinger's at the end in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of those.</v>

481
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

482
00:22:50.861 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I bet that if there were a retreat for </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>

483
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 2>they probably really get along and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribalism doesn't have to be bad.</v>

484
00:22:57.701 --> 00:23:01.390
<v Speaker 2>And in fact it can be consistent with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of individualism in sports.</v>

485
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.800
<v Speaker 2>You were saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how,</v>

486
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.920
<v Speaker 2>but that's a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine somebody telling you to </v>

487
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.711
<v Speaker 2>get stopped liking your favorite team?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm the and family it can be very </v>

488
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:17.791
<v Speaker 2>tribal of what I'm writing about now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>when tribalism takes over our political </v>

489
00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:21.661
<v Speaker 2>system and that is what is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous because a feature of the kind </v>

490
00:23:21.661 --> 00:23:25.861
<v Speaker 2>of problems I'm talking about is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just want to stick to your side no </v>

491
00:23:25.861 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 2>matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually take pleasure in seeing the</v>

492
00:23:28.301 --> 00:23:30.400
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Failure to sticking it to them.</v>

493
00:23:30.401 --> 00:23:33.220
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I experienced this all the time,</v>

494
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

495
00:23:34.211 --> 00:23:38.320
<v Speaker 2>if somebody hurts you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just human nature.</v>

496
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we are,</v>

497
00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:42.010
<v Speaker 2>we have massive problems in this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

498
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:47.040
<v Speaker 2>And as both of you have talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're at a point where we just can't </v>

499
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:48.470
<v Speaker 2>talk to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

500
00:23:48.471 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Americans can't talk to each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime anything happens,</v>

501
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.920
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a shooting or anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

502
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:55.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

503
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case,</v>

504
00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even worse than I'm not,</v>

505
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say it's all Steve Pinker.</v>

506
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.620
<v Speaker 2>It makes a great case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying that we're worse than</v>

507
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:08.730
<v Speaker 2>in every way in terms of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of tribalism in the </v>

508
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 2>political sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is an unusual moment.</v>

509
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:16.300
<v Speaker 2>And partly that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because of the demographic </v>

510
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:16.300
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very dislocating.</v>

511
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

512
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 2>and so I anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no will not to bring everything back to </v>

513
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 2>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm still partly convinced that it's</v>

514
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:27.300
<v Speaker 2>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I accept the changing demographics and I</v>

515
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.300
<v Speaker 2>trumpism and all of those things.</v>

516
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:34.630
<v Speaker 2>But I still think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I see this as I'm on tour with </v>

517
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:38.291
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson now and I'm getting back</v>
<v Speaker 2>into stand up in a meeting people </v>

518
00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:38.291
<v Speaker 2>across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

519
00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:42.280
<v Speaker 2>from all the diversity that the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>loves but across a true diverse set of </v>

520
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.961
<v Speaker 2>ideas to who they want answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're just not hearing from these </v>

521
00:24:46.961 --> 00:24:46.961
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

522
00:24:46.961 --> 00:24:51.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason that the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all doing are working.</v>

523
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 2>It's because we're fighting the forces </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

524
00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 2>So for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an optimist and you know,</v>

525
00:24:56.391 --> 00:24:59.630
<v Speaker 2>when I had you on the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems like 18 lifetimes ago,</v>

526
00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:01.880
<v Speaker 2>and we were talking about the moral arc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

527
00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:03.980
<v Speaker 2>that really was what you were selling me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>

528
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:08.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar to the pink or idea </v>

529
00:25:08.981 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 2>that things are bending in a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just harder to see it now perhaps.</v>

530
00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:15.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also because we set our standards </v>

531
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.771
<v Speaker 3>higher so that people say students in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sixties would be outraged by the </v>

532
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:22.140
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're outraged by Halloween </v>

533
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:22.140
<v Speaker 3>costumes</v>

534
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.500
<v Speaker 2>and that's actually good because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows you where were the smaller thing </v>

535
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:25.500
<v Speaker 2>that we're obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

536
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a correction.</v>

537
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:32.051
<v Speaker 2>I think that went too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good example of </v>

538
00:25:32.051 --> 00:25:33.430
<v Speaker 2>suggesting that what you are calling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

539
00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I think we're seeing a correction right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

540
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:41.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whatever people think about the </v>

541
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.310
<v Speaker 2>2016 election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

542
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:45.641
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people including elites were </v>

543
00:25:45.641 --> 00:25:47.351
<v Speaker 2>shocked and such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of new thinking and even </v>

544
00:25:47.351 --> 00:25:49.280
<v Speaker 2>from the Halloween costume thing now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

545
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel,</v>

546
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I feel that there's a little bit you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't tell immediately you're still </v>

547
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.250
<v Speaker 2>going to see the controversies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a shift.</v>

548
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what's interesting </v>

549
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 2>because it seems to me that some of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this intellectual darkweb or whatever</v>

550
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:08.510
<v Speaker 2>you want to call us at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw this for the last couple of years</v>

551
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:10.040
<v Speaker 2>of Matt's what drew people doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>match.</v>

552
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the confirmation for me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something bigger</v>

553
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 3>growing here in identity politics thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a problem because it feeds into the </v>

554
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:19.720
<v Speaker 3>tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your chapters,</v>

555
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.540
<v Speaker 3>a chapter on the trump phenomenon going </v>
<v Speaker 3>through nascar and world wrestling,</v>

556
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.230
<v Speaker 3>entertainment and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

557
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.240
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never really thought of those as </v>

558
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:31.240
<v Speaker 3>tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of course they are.</v>

559
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I contrasted that and I can't </v>

560
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 2>believe I didn't get in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

561
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I teach at a very liberal school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wait,</v>

562
00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:37.970
<v Speaker 2>you're on the Rubin report is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

563
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the occupy movement,</v>

564
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:41.650
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

565
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

566
00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I supported a lot of my students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love my students.</v>

567
00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I have to say I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

568
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I am an independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

569
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.290
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of them are doing great things</v>
<v Speaker 2>for justice.</v>

570
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:53.400
<v Speaker 2>So I even think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

571
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.370
<v Speaker 2>social justice warrior is again too big </v>
<v Speaker 2>a term,</v>

572
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's also the label,</v>

573
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.720
<v Speaker 2>but occupy is a movement that I say was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a movement ostensibly to help the poor </v>

574
00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:07.590
<v Speaker 2>that included no members of the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was vastly up at an elite group,</v>

575
00:27:07.591 --> 00:27:09.590
<v Speaker 2>highly educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these postgrads.</v>

576
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

577
00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I say,</v>

578
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a lot of the progressive elites</v>

579
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.200
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't aware.</v>

580
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.200
<v Speaker 2>In fact a lot of the working class white</v>
<v Speaker 2>working class or any working class are </v>

581
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.831
<v Speaker 2>actually very suspicious of a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>activists that are supposedly trying to </v>

582
00:27:24.831 --> 00:27:24.831
<v Speaker 2>help them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was an irony.</v>

583
00:27:24.831 --> 00:27:27.540
<v Speaker 2>And then I talk about so many of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>poorer,</v>

584
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.780
<v Speaker 2>including minorities belonging to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Prosperity Gospel,</v>

585
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.210
<v Speaker 2>the irony there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>praying for money,</v>

586
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.870
<v Speaker 2>they want money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not trying to occupy.</v>

587
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

588
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:41.901
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the thing that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thesis that a lot of elites in this </v>

589
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:45.440
<v Speaker 2>country wanting to do well actually just</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't,</v>

590
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.500
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are very blind to the group identities </v>

591
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 2>and tribal dynamics that matter most to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just people on the ground.</v>

592
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.270
<v Speaker 2>So to that point</v>

593
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:57.310
<v Speaker 1>was trump's greatest coup here that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was able to take the white working class</v>

594
00:27:58.401 --> 00:27:59.050
<v Speaker 1>mainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

595
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.810
<v Speaker 1>but other groups do and break them out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their tribalism or even if you,</v>

596
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.510
<v Speaker 1>even the Christian conservatives who </v>
<v Speaker 1>voted for him at record numbers,</v>

597
00:28:05.511 --> 00:28:10.511
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and still his support with them is </v>

598
00:28:10.511 --> 00:28:10.511
<v Speaker 1>through like 90 percent or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy that it.</v>

599
00:28:10.511 --> 00:28:13.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't vote for him for tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons because he's actually not one of</v>

600
00:28:13.341 --> 00:28:13.760
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

601
00:28:13.761 --> 00:28:15.260
<v Speaker 1>He was a rich New Yorker,</v>

602
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:16.840
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

603
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that he has done a into job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

604
00:28:20.421 --> 00:28:25.421
<v Speaker 2>I think he's done a brilliant job </v>
<v Speaker 2>portraying himself as a member of their </v>

605
00:28:25.421 --> 00:28:27.380
<v Speaker 2>cultural tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural tribe as,</v>

606
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.870
<v Speaker 2>as working white working class </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>

607
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.950
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think it's all a show </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of group identification is</v>

608
00:28:33.951 --> 00:28:36.080
<v Speaker 2>aesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an aesthetic.</v>

609
00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:41.081
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of style and values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in terms of the way that president </v>

610
00:28:41.081 --> 00:28:45.280
<v Speaker 2>trump dresses and stuffs themself on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's compared to what,</v>

611
00:28:45.281 --> 00:28:46.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Vegan,</v>

612
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:51.620
<v Speaker 2>it just looked donald and steaks and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>suits,</v>

613
00:28:51.621 --> 00:28:54.650
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NASCAR and worldwide wrestling.</v>

614
00:28:54.651 --> 00:28:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Are these things that are right about </v>
<v Speaker 2>these or not?</v>

615
00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a negative review that said,</v>

616
00:28:59.751 --> 00:29:01.280
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fringe phenomenon.</v>

617
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:04.520
<v Speaker 2>And I showed the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are NASA phenomenon,</v>

618
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:09.730
<v Speaker 2>these are the Prosperity Gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are millions and millions of </v>

619
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.530
<v Speaker 2>trump's in the hall of fame were all </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested.</v>

620
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.770
<v Speaker 2>And so in my circles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

621
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.280
<v Speaker 2>every time he said something sexist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

622
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.650
<v Speaker 2>everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's gonna be out of the office.</v>

623
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

624
00:29:23.571 --> 00:29:24.890
<v Speaker 2>the point is that people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

625
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:29.120
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Americans actually identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the way he talks and says something</v>

626
00:29:29.121 --> 00:29:32.660
<v Speaker 2>wrong or maybe lies and gets in trouble </v>
<v Speaker 2>than he's called out,</v>

627
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.560
<v Speaker 2>that they should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

628
00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.900
<v Speaker 2>this happens to me all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they feel.</v>

629
00:29:35.901 --> 00:29:37.010
<v Speaker 2>They don't feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

630
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.190
<v Speaker 2>So I think that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has established a,</v>

631
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.320
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cultural tribal connection even </v>

632
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:45.320
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

633
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:45.640
<v Speaker 2>he's is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that goes to the other thing.</v>

634
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of elites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

635
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing some research into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The socialists include a lot of people </v>

636
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:56.110
<v Speaker 2>who attend our top universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

637
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.860
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

638
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:03.540
<v Speaker 2>working class Americans have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're Latino or African </v>

639
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.350
<v Speaker 2>American white who actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

640
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.060
<v Speaker 2>would love to hit it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it big,</v>

641
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:11.160
<v Speaker 2>would love to enrich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a big building and have a nice </v>

642
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.761
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of irony in end in who </v>

643
00:30:14.761 --> 00:30:15.790
<v Speaker 2>was championing what and it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

644
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:16.870
<v Speaker 2>very fascinating.</v>

645
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just tribalism,</v>

646
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.670
<v Speaker 1>tribalism of a different sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

647
00:30:20.671 --> 00:30:25.671
<v Speaker 1>So it's like all these rappers years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>were rapping about trump because they </v>

648
00:30:25.671 --> 00:30:29.210
<v Speaker 1>liked all of the gold and the blaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the branding and all</v>

649
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.200
<v Speaker 2>that's tapped into lots of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>strands.</v>

650
00:30:31.201 --> 00:30:34.080
<v Speaker 2>Of course there was a racial thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was able to tap into to,</v>

651
00:30:34.081 --> 00:30:35.460
<v Speaker 2>but there was a lot of stuff there.</v>

652
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to just slightly jump back to </v>

653
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.131
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this liberal tribe that thinks that </v>

654
00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:44.651
<v Speaker 1>it's not a try because that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the group that I'm sort of most </v>

655
00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:46.470
<v Speaker 1>personally frustrated with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go after you get a lot.</v>

656
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so that probably has a lot to do</v>

657
00:30:48.741 --> 00:30:49.760
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not denying it,</v>

658
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.740
<v Speaker 1>but just accusing you of being in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribe and they're not in a tribe,</v>

659
00:30:52.741 --> 00:30:57.741
<v Speaker 1>but that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's what's driving me </v>

660
00:30:57.741 --> 00:30:57.790
<v Speaker 1>crazy about this is that they constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>are telling you,</v>

661
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:02.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm totally talking about the New </v>

662
00:31:02.791 --> 00:31:03.080
<v Speaker 1>York Times elite sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived on the upper west for 15 years,</v>

663
00:31:03.081 --> 00:31:05.360
<v Speaker 1>so I like a lot of these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

664
00:31:05.361 --> 00:31:10.361
<v Speaker 1>individually of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that set of people that think that </v>

665
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:14.591
<v Speaker 1>everyone else is this thing and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are actually the ones who have </v>

666
00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.700
<v Speaker 1>saucy while drinking the New York Times.</v>

667
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do think that all of us are </v>

668
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.080
<v Speaker 2>tribal and that is definitely a tribe a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's even by like,</v>

669
00:31:27.081 --> 00:31:31.130
<v Speaker 2>if you take like anthropological or </v>
<v Speaker 2>social scientists definitions,</v>

670
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of what you eat and your values</v>

671
00:31:34.341 --> 00:31:38.960
<v Speaker 2>and your self perception and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people vacation all the same places.</v>

672
00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

673
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:40.290
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

674
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.290
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

675
00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

676
00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.280
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friends are in that tribe and it's </v>

677
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.651
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just because it's one thing I say is </v>

678
00:31:50.651 --> 00:31:54.050
<v Speaker 2>a lot of progressivism is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could also be doing great things,</v>

679
00:31:54.051 --> 00:31:58.370
<v Speaker 2>but it is also really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an identity formation,</v>

680
00:31:58.371 --> 00:31:59.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people go,</v>

681
00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:00.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>occupy was a very,</v>

682
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gave them some solidarity.</v>

683
00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:05.690
<v Speaker 2>It was a fun feeling of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the marches.</v>

684
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.820
<v Speaker 2>I think people are going to get a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the politics while,</v>

685
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.700
<v Speaker 2>because they keep measuring the size of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the crowds everywhere,</v>

686
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.620
<v Speaker 2>the size of the protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's,</v>

687
00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people have to watch out because</v>

688
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:19.820
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you just look at the size of </v>

689
00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:19.820
<v Speaker 2>the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

690
00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:20.030
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what the is going.</v>

691
00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.490
<v Speaker 2>But maybe those are areas where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole.</v>

692
00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

693
00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you were reading Amy's book as </v>

694
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.680
<v Speaker 1>someone that's sort of tracked moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress through time,</v>

695
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:36.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think there is a right amount of </v>

696
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.551
<v Speaker 1>tribalism that allows us to be the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can is as people in society?</v>

697
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I your epilogue talks about how to break</v>

698
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:48.480
<v Speaker 3>through some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I liked because there's a lot of </v>

699
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.661
<v Speaker 3>social psych there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can we quit thinking of each other </v>

700
00:32:51.661 --> 00:32:51.790
<v Speaker 3>in that way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other bigger issue on the spread</v>

701
00:32:51.791 --> 00:32:56.410
<v Speaker 3>of market capitalism say that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>identified these a market,</v>

702
00:32:56.411 --> 00:33:01.411
<v Speaker 3>dominant minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea this was happening in </v>

703
00:33:01.411 --> 00:33:01.800
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam and I just binge watched Ken </v>
<v Speaker 3>Burns's,</v>

704
00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18 hours of the Vietnam war and I,</v>

705
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:09.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember anything about the 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the population over 90 </v>

706
00:33:09.761 --> 00:33:10.570
<v Speaker 3>percent of the</v>

707
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.920
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As relates to your point about this is </v>

708
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.000
<v Speaker 2>something funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep getting in trouble for every book</v>

709
00:33:16.001 --> 00:33:20.470
<v Speaker 2>that I've written about the taboo for </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons that I think are silly.</v>

710
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they should be terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I coined this term of 2003 a market </v>

711
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.520
<v Speaker 2>dominant minorities and it refers to </v>
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>

712
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:31.630
<v Speaker 2>usually ethnic minorities like the three</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent Chinese in Indonesia.</v>

713
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Just three percent ethnic Chinese who </v>
<v Speaker 2>control 70 percent of the economy.</v>

714
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Now what I wrote that I think the </v>
<v Speaker 2>instant us liberal progressive </v>

715
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:41.720
<v Speaker 2>responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

716
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.170
<v Speaker 2>how could she say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like she's got to be stereotyping.</v>

717
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.120
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just documented it</v>

718
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:52.270
<v Speaker 1>even though it can also be argued that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a positive stereotype because </v>

719
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:52.270
<v Speaker 1>it's through work and education and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of questions.</v>

720
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:56.360
<v Speaker 2>So comfortable with any group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acid make generalizations.</v>

721
00:33:56.361 --> 00:33:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was saying,</v>

722
00:33:57.171 --> 00:34:02.171
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to ever solve these </v>

723
00:34:02.171 --> 00:34:02.171
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it also,</v>

724
00:34:02.171 --> 00:34:03.770
<v Speaker 2>when I even say whites in South Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 14 percent controlling,</v>

725
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:05.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of the best land.</v>

726
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.590
<v Speaker 2>So even the reasons for being a market </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant minority can vary.</v>

727
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it can be a history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>colonialism or apartheid.</v>

728
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so nobody celebrating it necessarily,</v>

729
00:34:15.411 --> 00:34:20.411
<v Speaker 2>although groups like the Chinese or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indians or the Lebanese are harder to </v>

730
00:34:20.411 --> 00:34:21.110
<v Speaker 2>explain because they were non </v>
<v Speaker 2>colonizers.</v>

731
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.110
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a phenomenon that fits,</v>

732
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

733
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:25.820
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

734
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:30.290
<v Speaker 2>it coexists in a complicated way with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these enlightenment forces.</v>

735
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you want would be nice if,</v>

736
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:37.860
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if markets just just benefited all </v>

737
00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.010
<v Speaker 2>ethnic ethnicities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ito.</v>

738
00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:43.260
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this tell you about how we </v>

739
00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:43.260
<v Speaker 1>treat victimhood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

740
00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:43.750
<v Speaker 1>So the example I can use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do,</v>

741
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.940
<v Speaker 1>and you just mentioned this about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>three percent Chinese.</v>

742
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you guys saw this a couple </v>

743
00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.390
<v Speaker 1>months ago when this documentary came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out about Apu from the simpsons.</v>

744
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw night 90 percent of what I saw</v>

745
00:34:55.901 --> 00:34:56.650
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

746
00:34:56.651 --> 00:34:59.140
<v Speaker 1>it's just what you're reading online was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually no,</v>

747
00:34:59.141 --> 00:35:01.570
<v Speaker 1>he was a good character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's beloved by everybody.</v>

748
00:35:01.571 --> 00:35:03.610
<v Speaker 1>He's actually the hardest working guy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the town.</v>

749
00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:08.820
<v Speaker 1>He's one of homer's good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did an episode on on immigration </v>

750
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:08.820
<v Speaker 1>because of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

751
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.600
<v Speaker 1>he's a Vegan at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these wonderful things.</v>

752
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Indian Americans I think are the number </v>
<v Speaker 1>one socioeconomic group in the country </v>

753
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.290
<v Speaker 1>are pretty damn close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think their average median incomes,</v>

754
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.300
<v Speaker 1>six figures or it's a great measure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>success in all of these things.</v>

755
00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.350
<v Speaker 1>And yet I saw this sliver of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm frustrated with,</v>

756
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.750
<v Speaker 1>this sort of elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lefty,</v>

757
00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive's demanding that this victim</v>

758
00:35:32.981 --> 00:35:36.790
<v Speaker 1>hood should exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is the root of.</v>

759
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>So much of our</v>

760
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.310
<v Speaker 2>tribal problems are about forgetting </v>
<v Speaker 2>your successes.</v>

761
00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:41.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

762
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

763
00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

764
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:44.640
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

765
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 2>just personally I understand where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are coming from,</v>

766
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:49.190
<v Speaker 2>but personally I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

767
00:35:49.191 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like the victim put thing.</v>

768
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.600
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also psychologically very </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult waiting and you get this </v>

769
00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 2>oppression Olympics where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

770
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:01.620
<v Speaker 2>your who can be lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have more problems.</v>

771
00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on this,</v>

772
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:08.360
<v Speaker 2>without getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have had a lot of south Asian </v>

773
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.120
<v Speaker 2>friends say that they were very upset </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

774
00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:14.121
<v Speaker 2>To my surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to understand and I wonder if </v>

775
00:36:14.121 --> 00:36:15.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a big generational thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is partly,</v>

776
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.270
<v Speaker 2>it feels bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it partly what makes America great.</v>

777
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

778
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.750
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was young,</v>

779
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:27.080
<v Speaker 2>my dad was immigrant and get a Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 2>accent and I would see him being what </v>

780
00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.650
<v Speaker 2>you might call discriminated against </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

781
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.370
<v Speaker 2>like whatever.</v>

782
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.880
<v Speaker 2>And I would feel so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like this eight year old kid and </v>

783
00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.720
<v Speaker 2>just feels so shameful and so angry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think my dad didn't even notice,</v>

784
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:41.721
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then later had mentioned to my dad </v>

785
00:36:41.721 --> 00:36:41.721
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is such a great country.</v>

786
00:36:41.721 --> 00:36:42.110
<v Speaker 2>She's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came from,</v>

787
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I came from and I'm going to rise and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

788
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.810
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he just made it the American dream.</v>

789
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.320
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

790
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.600
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I often in,</v>

791
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:56.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an older person now I see very </v>

792
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.690
<v Speaker 2>generationally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>

793
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.740
<v Speaker 2>I bet if you asked an older generation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

794
00:36:58.741 --> 00:36:59.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

795
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:04.580
<v Speaker 2>of South Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about that I wonder if you might </v>

796
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.441
<v Speaker 2>not get a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas you get the children or </v>

797
00:37:06.441 --> 00:37:07.620
<v Speaker 2>grandchildren of those immigrants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in a very different mentality,</v>

798
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.250
<v Speaker 2>educated in our campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much worse than you know.</v>

799
00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

800
00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 2>that's really what you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about the Halloween </v>

801
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 2>costumes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

802
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.800
<v Speaker 2>That the arc here has meant so much that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually put aside all of the </v>

803
00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:23.910
<v Speaker 2>successes and then to just be upset by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoon character.</v>

804
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.560
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

805
00:37:25.561 --> 00:37:26.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a net good.</v>

806
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.650
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to that good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

807
00:37:28.651 --> 00:37:33.651
<v Speaker 3>but it's fine tuning younger people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>intuitions to go toward smaller and </v>

808
00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:35.950
<v Speaker 3>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

809
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:41.510
<v Speaker 3>assaults on their ego or dignity or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that they then elevate into </v>

810
00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 3>these massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is the equivalent of slavery,</v>

811
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.000
<v Speaker 3>rapey and the environment is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>equivalent of rape or whatever,</v>

812
00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just elevating the,</v>

813
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:53.550
<v Speaker 3>these words in things that they can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked up about because we do have a,</v>

814
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:58.730
<v Speaker 3>a moral module or network or whatever in</v>
<v Speaker 3>our brain that we get worked up over </v>

815
00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:00.270
<v Speaker 3>things and whether,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's the Vietnam war,</v>

816
00:38:00.271 --> 00:38:02.160
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now it's the Halloween costume,</v>

817
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.740
<v Speaker 3>but it's the same emotions that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>still being driven.</v>

818
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:07.140
<v Speaker 3>And that's another problem with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribalism,</v>

819
00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:07.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

820
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe the moral arc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe again,</v>

821
00:38:09.581 --> 00:38:11.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm an optimist too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

822
00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:13.930
<v Speaker 2>and I think something is changing after </v>
<v Speaker 2>2016.</v>

823
00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.570
<v Speaker 2>I have many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quote this guy,</v>

824
00:38:16.571 --> 00:38:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Giovanni,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely progressive student,</v>

825
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latin American parents from Mexico lived</v>

826
00:38:24.191 --> 00:38:29.191
<v Speaker 2>in a trailer park and he saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we went to bar week stop on this</v>

827
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Halloween costume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The line he uses is that crying wolf too</v>

828
00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:35.050
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

829
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 2>So that when you get serious and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

830
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.460
<v Speaker 2>so I actually think there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>correction,</v>

831
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:40.450
<v Speaker 2>not everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

832
00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 2>There's still things that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just,</v>

833
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.620
<v Speaker 2>just a waste of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

834
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:46.570
<v Speaker 2>we have serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious problems and um,</v>

835
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:47.070
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

836
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 2>but I think there is some sense even </v>
<v Speaker 2>even among this group saying,</v>

837
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:56.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is not the best thing to </v>

838
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:56.850
<v Speaker 2>focus on.</v>

839
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you guys make of the fact that </v>

840
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:59.530
<v Speaker 1>this seems to be global right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I know that because of technology,</v>

841
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:02.890
<v Speaker 1>that this movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

842
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:07.891
<v Speaker 1>whatever's happening here now where so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people are waking up to the </v>

843
00:39:07.891 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 1>overcorrection or whatever you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>call it,</v>

844
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:13.260
<v Speaker 1>that the amount of email that I get from</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are seeing this in India is </v>

845
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.130
<v Speaker 1>what I'm getting from people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing this in Canada.</v>

846
00:39:15.131 --> 00:39:20.131
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tells you something really </v>

847
00:39:20.131 --> 00:39:21.700
<v Speaker 1>interesting happening despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in the political histories.</v>

848
00:39:21.701 --> 00:39:22.420
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

849
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:23.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

850
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.560
<v Speaker 1>the political establishment of those.</v>

851
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:31.080
<v Speaker 3>It could be a selective focus because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>social media and realtime covering of </v>

852
00:39:32.401 --> 00:39:37.401
<v Speaker 3>these incidences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do wonder to what extent the problem </v>

853
00:39:37.401 --> 00:39:41.811
<v Speaker 3>really exists on college campuses of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>this campus craziness like Chapman </v>

854
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.720
<v Speaker 3>University where I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen anything like this and,</v>

855
00:39:44.721 --> 00:39:45.670
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

856
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.480
<v Speaker 3>and most of the time when I travel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>give talks at colleges,</v>

857
00:39:48.481 --> 00:39:53.481
<v Speaker 3>you never see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just people just students are </v>

858
00:39:53.481 --> 00:39:55.790
<v Speaker 3>hunkered down doing their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to bring you to University of New </v>

859
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Hampshire next time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed your opinion on that pretty </v>

860
00:39:59.050 --> 00:39:59.050
<v Speaker 3>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They shaking or something that's made,</v>

861
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.300
<v Speaker 3>but it could be that the minority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a minority,</v>

862
00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:06.030
<v Speaker 3>but they're loud and they're instantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>covered now.</v>

863
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.740
<v Speaker 3>So it seems like Tucker Carlson in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekly campus craziness.</v>

864
00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:14.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like if I walked on campus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to see riots going,</v>

865
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:14.520
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

866
00:40:14.521 --> 00:40:19.521
<v Speaker 3>you don't hardly ever see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this idea of pluralistic </v>

867
00:40:19.521 --> 00:40:22.200
<v Speaker 3>ignorance or the spiral of silence where</v>
<v Speaker 3>a minority can take over.</v>

868
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:27.850
<v Speaker 3>Toxic ideology can take over a country </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Germany in the 19 thirties were </v>

869
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:33.140
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most Germans were not on board with </v>

870
00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.511
<v Speaker 3>Hitler's program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they thought everybody else was and </v>

871
00:40:35.511 --> 00:40:38.601
<v Speaker 3>there's punishment for descent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get the spread of these toxic </v>

872
00:40:38.601 --> 00:40:38.601
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When actually most people,</v>

873
00:40:38.601 --> 00:40:43.461
<v Speaker 3>like most college students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will it privately say I'm against binge </v>

874
00:40:43.461 --> 00:40:43.461
<v Speaker 3>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it,</v>

875
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.450
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

876
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.770
<v Speaker 3>but they think but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know all my friends are into it so</v>

877
00:40:46.771 --> 00:40:51.771
<v Speaker 3>I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everyone says that that's what I'm </v>

878
00:40:51.771 --> 00:40:54.591
<v Speaker 3>more concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want to know about your experience </v>

879
00:40:54.591 --> 00:40:54.591
<v Speaker 3>on college campuses</v>

880
00:40:54.591 --> 00:40:55.800
<v Speaker 1>because I find when I go there and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually invited by,</v>

881
00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:58.260
<v Speaker 1>it's usually libertarian groups are </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying in a center,</v>

882
00:40:58.261 --> 00:41:03.261
<v Speaker 1>right or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's College Republicans and </v>

883
00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:03.261
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I always say,</v>

884
00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:06.471
<v Speaker 1>I would gladly do it if the Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 1>would invite me and I'll get the same </v>

885
00:41:06.471 --> 00:41:06.471
<v Speaker 1>exact speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

886
00:41:06.471 --> 00:41:11.450
<v Speaker 1>but what I find is that even for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians who basically just want to </v>

887
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:14.391
<v Speaker 1>live and let live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're finding they're afraid to say </v>

888
00:41:14.391 --> 00:41:17.211
<v Speaker 1>what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that all of the kids are </v>

889
00:41:17.211 --> 00:41:20.660
<v Speaker 1>screaming and doing violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm more concerned about that </v>

890
00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:24.150
<v Speaker 1>secondary set of students that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>college is afraid to say what they think</v>

891
00:41:24.151 --> 00:41:29.151
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going to get out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly start telling the world that </v>

892
00:41:29.151 --> 00:41:29.151
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>

893
00:41:29.151 --> 00:41:29.740
<v Speaker 2>This is a great irony though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because for the Libertarians,</v>

894
00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:31.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you need strong leadership.</v>

895
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

896
00:41:32.681 --> 00:41:34.960
<v Speaker 1>they were doing could do a hell of a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>better in that department.</v>

897
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Like even for the campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think somebody,</v>

898
00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:40.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

899
00:41:40.321 --> 00:41:41.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

900
00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I so agree with you Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's,</v>

901
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a positive thing.</v>

902
00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again it's both sides,</v>

903
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:49.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

904
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.140
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the loudest voices and then there's</v>

905
00:41:52.141 --> 00:41:56.880
<v Speaker 2>a lot of bullying and shaming and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to so many students one on one or</v>

906
00:41:56.881 --> 00:42:01.881
<v Speaker 2>even like even in my own classroom I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty well known for having one of </v>

907
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:03.090
<v Speaker 2>the most diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually maybe the most diverse class,</v>

908
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.730
<v Speaker 2>but not just ethnically and racially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although that too,</v>

909
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.480
<v Speaker 2>but I had 15 members of the federalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

910
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:14.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in addition to 15 members of the black </v>

911
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.510
<v Speaker 2>students association and Non Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>

912
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.380
<v Speaker 2>And admittedly it wasn't constitutional </v>
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

913
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:18.180
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a class that was a little bit,</v>

914
00:42:18.181 --> 00:42:23.181
<v Speaker 2>not as charged now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still talk about democracy and an </v>

915
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:23.181
<v Speaker 2>ethnic conflict and all these issues.</v>

916
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:25.440
<v Speaker 2>The 2016 election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I set the rules,</v>

917
00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:26.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

918
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said these are the rules for this</v>

919
00:42:28.381 --> 00:42:33.381
<v Speaker 2>class and you there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a wait list so don't come if </v>

920
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:36.591
<v Speaker 2>you can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if somebody for this particular </v>

921
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:36.591
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's going to be difficult,</v>

922
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:41.301
<v Speaker 2>but if somebody says something and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't quite use the vocabulary that you </v>

923
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:44.340
<v Speaker 2>would use or they say something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe offense you for this,</v>

924
00:42:44.341 --> 00:42:45.840
<v Speaker 2>just this class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>

925
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.910
<v Speaker 2>can you just not assume worst motives?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just assume that they just.</v>

926
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:52.530
<v Speaker 2>Can we just add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

927
00:42:52.531 --> 00:42:54.870
<v Speaker 2>I can have success with it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy.</v>

928
00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.440
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.030
<v Speaker 2>even our dean said these are free speech</v>
<v Speaker 2>norms.</v>

930
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.930
<v Speaker 2>You can protest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody can protest,</v>

931
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.240
<v Speaker 2>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to be allowed to speak.</v>

932
00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.270
<v Speaker 2>So I think leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's been a lot of cowardice</v>

933
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 1>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're selling me on in this instance</v>

934
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.700
<v Speaker 1>on a ton of top down version of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you think it has.</v>

935
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.850
<v Speaker 1>I basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at a college campus,</v>

936
00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I do agree with it because you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better phrase,</v>

937
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.650
<v Speaker 1>you can't have the inmates running the </v>
<v Speaker 1>asylum.</v>

938
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.680
<v Speaker 1>These kids are supposed to learn there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there have to learn by people that </v>

939
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:23.840
<v Speaker 1>are smarter than them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in this case,</v>

940
00:43:23.841 --> 00:43:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I am okay with some top down.</v>

941
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

942
00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:27.830
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

943
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.110
<v Speaker 1>have you had any pushback against that </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

944
00:43:30.111 --> 00:43:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Because I'd imagine that's got to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard pill to swallow.</v>

945
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Not the Dean our Dean has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

946
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:39.210
<v Speaker 2>And if they're always hard cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hard cases and um,</v>

947
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

948
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.520
<v Speaker 2>I've do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

949
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get in trouble all the time,</v>

950
00:43:44.061 --> 00:43:46.070
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I not terrible trouble,</v>

951
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:51.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe it's because I'm a </v>

952
00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:51.800
<v Speaker 2>minority woman to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody is going to be</v>

953
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.090
<v Speaker 1>you using identity politics against a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very clever.</v>

954
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't even get used it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like,</v>

955
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:57.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

956
00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:02.820
<v Speaker 2>and I definitely know what it feels like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be an outsider of your first </v>

957
00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:02.820
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

958
00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:02.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

959
00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:08.070
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always had a lot of classical </v>

960
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:08.170
<v Speaker 2>liberals try to speak for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

961
00:44:08.171 --> 00:44:08.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

962
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.920
<v Speaker 2>I really kind of get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

963
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.150
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

964
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

965
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.090
<v Speaker 1>well you identify as a minority woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>

966
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I've been feeling that more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

967
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:20.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

968
00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.870
<v Speaker 1>the other thing about reading your book </v>
<v Speaker 1>though was how,</v>

969
00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our state department did not seem to get</v>

970
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:30.060
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these tribal conflicts in Vietnam,</v>

971
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>

972
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 1>does no one call a professor at Yale and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

973
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.800
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're thinking about this is our </v>

974
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:39.800
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

975
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:39.800
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was reading that,</v>

976
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I kept thinking of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember during the 2008 </v>

977
00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:48.741
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Obama running the first time during </v>

978
00:44:48.741 --> 00:44:49.050
<v Speaker 1>the primaries there having the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the democratic debate,</v>

979
00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:54.051
<v Speaker 1>and Joe Biden was still running at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and they're all talking about Iraq </v>

980
00:44:54.051 --> 00:44:54.051
<v Speaker 1>and Joe Biden goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

981
00:44:54.051 --> 00:44:58.701
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq should be split into three </v>

982
00:44:58.701 --> 00:45:01.401
<v Speaker 1>countries because there should be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunni country and a Shia country and a </v>

983
00:45:01.401 --> 00:45:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because this,</v>

984
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.710
<v Speaker 1>this tribal stuff has been going on way </v>
<v Speaker 1>before us,</v>

985
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:06.450
<v Speaker 1>way before the bread from the Ottomans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blah,</v>

986
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:06.750
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

987
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.240
<v Speaker 1>And people thought he was completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>bananas.</v>

988
00:45:09.241 --> 00:45:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Now I think there's probably plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other reasons I think he's been at it,</v>

989
00:45:11.481 --> 00:45:16.481
<v Speaker 1>but putting that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was getting to the heart of what you </v>

990
00:45:16.481 --> 00:45:16.481
<v Speaker 1>were saying.</v>

991
00:45:16.481 --> 00:45:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if that was the right </v>

992
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.910
<v Speaker 2>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

993
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.910
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

994
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:23.781
<v Speaker 2>this is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This half the book is about our foreign </v>

995
00:45:23.781 --> 00:45:25.050
<v Speaker 2>policy fiascos and how it's our us </v>
<v Speaker 2>blindness to these.</v>

996
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

997
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.920
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the force of identities that we barely </v>

998
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.720
<v Speaker 2>know anything about Sunni Shias current </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the same or,</v>

999
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.530
<v Speaker 2>or Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pashtuns,</v>

1000
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Uzbeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1001
00:45:36.061 --> 00:45:36.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1002
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese,</v>

1003
00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Vietnamese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Korean,</v>

1004
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.130
<v Speaker 2>all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1005
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:46.550
<v Speaker 2>and it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is something that I have not gotten </v>

1006
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.870
<v Speaker 2>in trouble for this because it's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of very critical chapter saying that our</v>

1007
00:45:48.871 --> 00:45:52.830
<v Speaker 2>greatest foreign policy disaster stem </v>
<v Speaker 2>from this one thing,</v>

1008
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:55.970
<v Speaker 2>our failure to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there,</v>

1009
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.850
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1010
00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.960
<v Speaker 2>these tribal identities that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1011
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 2>we imagined that democracy will just </v>
<v Speaker 2>smooth and away,</v>

1012
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:07.510
<v Speaker 2>but just have some elections and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything will just kind of melt away </v>

1013
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:11.210
<v Speaker 2>or markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I show is that democracy under </v>

1014
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of circumstances actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>catalyzes those group conflicts.</v>

1015
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.140
<v Speaker 2>It gets worse.</v>

1016
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Are there moments though that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

1017
00:46:16.131 --> 00:46:21.131
<v Speaker 1>either because of war or famine or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else that actually we can get </v>

1018
00:46:21.131 --> 00:46:22.370
<v Speaker 1>past those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like for example,</v>

1019
00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:27.170
<v Speaker 1>things actually were going pretty well </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Iraq after they had their elections,</v>

1020
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1021
00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:33.820
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward the end of the George W Bush for </v>

1022
00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.311
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we should have gotten in there </v>

1023
00:46:36.311 --> 00:46:37.451
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were actually having free and </v>

1024
00:46:37.451 --> 00:46:39.881
<v Speaker 1>fair elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounded like he was getting a little </v>

1025
00:46:39.881 --> 00:46:40.040
<v Speaker 1>more secularized then we left and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so be it.</v>

1026
00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.270
<v Speaker 1>But then things got reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we actually built out of the chaos.</v>

1027
00:46:44.271 --> 00:46:46.310
<v Speaker 1>We started doing something good and now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1028
00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:46.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1029
00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I tell a slightly more detailed story </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that slight disagreement.</v>

1030
00:46:50.921 --> 00:46:55.921
<v Speaker 2>I think we are really messed up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy bit when we first got in </v>

1031
00:46:55.921 --> 00:47:00.841
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think actually most of the key </v>

1032
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:00.841
<v Speaker 2>players say that now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1033
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:01.140
<v Speaker 2>like secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Condoleezza Rice said,</v>

1034
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:06.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should've paid more attention to the </v>

1035
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.150
<v Speaker 2>tribal structures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1036
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:09.220
<v Speaker 2>and worked with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're getting at is I write about </v>

1037
00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.960
<v Speaker 2>a success case and this is the 2007 </v>
<v Speaker 2>search.</v>

1038
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting aside politics that's gotten so </v>

1039
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:15.990
<v Speaker 2>polarized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most Americans,</v>

1040
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.700
<v Speaker 2>they even know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that we put it in more troops.</v>

1041
00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:23.850
<v Speaker 2>What they don't know is that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>180 degree change in our foreign policy.</v>

1042
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:29.250
<v Speaker 2>The people in charge said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's pay attention to the groups now </v>

1043
00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 2>let's go talk to some sheets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she used to,</v>

1044
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:34.990
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they educated their troops like here's </v>

1045
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:34.990
<v Speaker 2>the difference between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what they were,</v>

1046
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 2>here's what they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your their ceremonies,</v>

1047
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:41.730
<v Speaker 2>and they really turned it around it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I document all the numbers within at a </v>

1048
00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:44.860
<v Speaker 2>point when things were so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they brought sectarian violence down.</v>

1049
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:47.350
<v Speaker 2>They brought suicide bombing casualties </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1050
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:52.560
<v Speaker 2>and then yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point us lost its political </v>

1051
00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:52.560
<v Speaker 2>wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've left</v>

1052
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:54.910
<v Speaker 1>politics really just straight up mess it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1053
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:56.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because things were getting better.</v>

1054
00:47:56.291 --> 00:47:57.250
<v Speaker 1>They had real life</v>

1055
00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.290
<v Speaker 2>is it shows that if we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1056
00:47:59.291 --> 00:48:02.500
<v Speaker 2>the weird optimist in me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we have done so many things</v>

1057
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:07.530
<v Speaker 2>in our foreign policy so foolishly that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can really do so much better.</v>

1058
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:11.290
<v Speaker 2>We just have to pay a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to these groups,</v>

1059
00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:13.560
<v Speaker 2>which are what people raised it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1060
00:48:13.561 --> 00:48:15.280
<v Speaker 2>that that's the first thing they hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1061
00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

1062
00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 2>the reason for this is something also I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think positive.</v>

1063
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we so blind to it?</v>

1064
00:48:21.731 --> 00:48:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Because I contrast us to the British,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the British,</v>

1065
00:48:24.071 --> 00:48:26.360
<v Speaker 2>and they're divided in rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1066
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:31.470
<v Speaker 2>they were incredibly group conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had these huge documents detailing </v>

1067
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.880
<v Speaker 2>all the different caste differences and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they used it to divide.</v>

1068
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1069
00:48:34.531 --> 00:48:35.050
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1070
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.390
<v Speaker 2>that's not what we should do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite,</v>

1071
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:42.480
<v Speaker 2>but I think it has to do with our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary success with assimilation.</v>

1072
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an,</v>

1073
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:50.010
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not every group but more than any other </v>

1074
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:50.010
<v Speaker 2>country we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:54.960
<v Speaker 2>the idea is if Irish people and Italians</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hungarians and Polish can all become</v>

1076
00:48:56.171 --> 00:49:01.171
<v Speaker 2>Americans within one generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's have some election because </v>

1077
00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Sudanese and she isn't currently and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1078
00:49:02.831 --> 00:49:04.420
<v Speaker 2>it's other countries are not like us.</v>

1079
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

1080
00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:11.180
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is a movement building right </v>

1081
00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:11.580
<v Speaker 1>now and some of these enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 1>values are coming back,</v>

1082
00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:12.990
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

1083
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm with Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1084
00:49:14.191 --> 00:49:16.380
<v Speaker 1>so let's say there is a movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

1085
00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:21.650
<v Speaker 1>What do we have to do as people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it or want to build something </v>

1086
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:26.331
<v Speaker 1>good to avoid the negative parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribalism that will inherently come </v>

1087
00:49:26.761 --> 00:49:27.390
<v Speaker 1>along with it.</v>

1088
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Well read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read Amy's.</v>

1089
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:32.750
<v Speaker 3>It ends positively about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's some of the things we could do.</v>

1090
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:37.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call this the Indu who effect from </v>

1091
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.160
<v Speaker 3>that Jack Nicholson's film about Schmidt</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he told us he adopts a child </v>

1092
00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.430
<v Speaker 3>watching late night TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1093
00:49:43.431 --> 00:49:48.431
<v Speaker 3>if you give $15 a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this will help little Enugu and they </v>

1094
00:49:48.431 --> 00:49:49.550
<v Speaker 3>show a picture of indiegogo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1095
00:49:49.551 --> 00:49:51.920
<v Speaker 3>as we know from studies that if you show</v>
<v Speaker 3>a picture of 10,000</v>

1096
00:49:51.921 --> 00:49:53.780
<v Speaker 3>starving kids in Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people give a dollar.</v>

1097
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:58.990
<v Speaker 3>If you show a little indigo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're willing to give you 100 times </v>

1098
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:00.470
<v Speaker 3>more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's tricking the brain into thinking</v>

1099
00:50:00.471 --> 00:50:05.471
<v Speaker 3>little Hindu who is an honorary member </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my tribe and so that kind of we know </v>

1100
00:50:05.691 --> 00:50:07.820
<v Speaker 3>how to do that from fundraising and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1101
00:50:07.821 --> 00:50:12.821
<v Speaker 3>That has to be applied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think politically that you know you </v>

1102
00:50:12.821 --> 00:50:13.190
<v Speaker 3>have to identify with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you pointed out.</v>

1103
00:50:13.191 --> 00:50:18.191
<v Speaker 3>You know actually when you actually know</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gay person or a black person or a Jew </v>

1104
00:50:18.191 --> 00:50:18.710
<v Speaker 3>or somebody like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not your normal tribe.</v>

1105
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.020
<v Speaker 3>That does break down those tribal </v>
<v Speaker 3>barriers.</v>

1106
00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Your colleague Paul Bloom and his book </v>
<v Speaker 3>against empathy points out that the dark</v>

1107
00:50:24.951 --> 00:50:26.000
<v Speaker 3>side of empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we're,</v>

1108
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.400
<v Speaker 3>if we're super cooperative</v>

1109
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:33.400
<v Speaker 2>and supportive of our tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes us even more wary of other </v>

1110
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:39.041
<v Speaker 2>tribes because they can be a threat to </v>
<v Speaker 2>our people that we liked so much and so </v>

1111
00:50:39.041 --> 00:50:41.600
<v Speaker 2>we have to break through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Acknowledged the tribalism,</v>

1112
00:50:41.601 --> 00:50:46.601
<v Speaker 2>but also counter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes back to your favorite work </v>

1113
00:50:46.601 --> 00:50:49.580
<v Speaker 2>individually because those studies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really positive at the end show that</v>

1114
00:50:49.581 --> 00:50:54.581
<v Speaker 2>if you can pull people out of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups and by the way not just dumped </v>

1115
00:50:54.581 --> 00:50:56.900
<v Speaker 2>them altogether to more hating of each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

1116
00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:00.560
<v Speaker 2>but if you can interact with another </v>
<v Speaker 2>person as an individual,</v>

1117
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:05.590
<v Speaker 2>which of course is the whole hard part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's astounding how much progress you </v>

1118
00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:10.301
<v Speaker 2>can make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best example I like is the </v>

1119
00:51:10.301 --> 00:51:10.520
<v Speaker 2>integration of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>US military in the 19 fifties,</v>

1120
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:13.850
<v Speaker 2>everybody was against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like 80 percent and this can't</v>

1121
00:51:13.851 --> 00:51:18.851
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And afterwards they found that the </v>

1122
00:51:18.851 --> 00:51:21.101
<v Speaker 2>integrated troops were as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or more effective than the all white </v>

1123
00:51:21.101 --> 00:51:21.101
<v Speaker 2>troops.</v>

1124
00:51:21.101 --> 00:51:23.720
<v Speaker 2>And then they interviewed everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just kind of your point.</v>

1125
00:51:23.721 --> 00:51:24.830
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1126
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a foxhole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1127
00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:31.490
<v Speaker 2>if you miss your family and the same way</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to put your life in somebody </v>

1128
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:34.961
<v Speaker 2>else's hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't care what their accent is or </v>

1129
00:51:34.961 --> 00:51:35.090
<v Speaker 2>you don't care what the color of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin is.</v>

1130
00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:37.130
<v Speaker 2>And that was like an actually an </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible,</v>

1131
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:39.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cross pollinating moment.</v>

1132
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's shift a little bit here for </v>

1133
00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:44.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the last little bit here.</v>

1134
00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:48.250
<v Speaker 2>So I want to talk about some tiger moms </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff because I do think that partly </v>

1135
00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:51.290
<v Speaker 2>what I'm seeing right now is I'm on tour</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Jordan Peterson,</v>

1136
00:51:51.291 --> 00:51:56.291
<v Speaker 2>is not that he's Tiger Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's filling a role of something </v>

1137
00:51:56.451 --> 00:52:01.451
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not necessarily as outright </v>

1138
00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:02.160
<v Speaker 2>aggressive as say tiger mom would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1139
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.060
<v Speaker 2>but he's fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's filling some role there.</v>

1140
00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's sort of fair to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So funny that you said that because </v>

1141
00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:10.060
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's an incredibly polarizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure,</v>

1142
00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:13.160
<v Speaker 2>but when I watched a few things and read</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few chips,</v>

1143
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:14.970
<v Speaker 2>that's what it reminded me of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

1144
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:16.190
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1145
00:52:16.191 --> 00:52:20.750
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I said in target mom </v>
<v Speaker 2>was assume strength rather than weakness</v>

1146
00:52:20.751 --> 00:52:22.010
<v Speaker 2>in your children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1147
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:24.290
<v Speaker 2>and I got a lot of trouble for saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1148
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:27.860
<v Speaker 2>but what's the pushback on a statement </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

1149
00:52:27.861 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh gosh,</v>

1150
00:52:30.261 --> 00:52:32.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these mental health issues that I've</v>

1151
00:52:32.111 --> 00:52:36.740
<v Speaker 2>gotten a lot of trouble with Jeff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a first of all,</v>

1152
00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is tiger parenting?</v>

1153
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1154
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:44.430
<v Speaker 2>and it is really true that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asian Americans have parents that are </v>

1155
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:48.881
<v Speaker 2>too stifling and too strict on both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides and they make their children </v>

1156
00:52:48.881 --> 00:52:50.000
<v Speaker 2>miserable and people have committed.</v>

1157
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.530
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's trust.</v>

1158
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:56.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a parenting is one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that affects everybody because not </v>

1159
00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.610
<v Speaker 2>everybody has a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody had a parent.</v>

1160
00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.870
<v Speaker 2>So it's always personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think there is something,</v>

1161
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:04.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

1162
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:04.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1163
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand why I was in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of this firestorm either.</v>

1164
00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1165
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.490
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because you're in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>

1166
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.030
<v Speaker 2>you're experiencing it and people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask me at the time and at the time I had</v>

1167
00:53:17.031 --> 00:53:20.480
<v Speaker 2>no idea at the time I was just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>defend myself.</v>

1168
00:53:20.481 --> 00:53:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I was stumped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody told me to stop apologizing,</v>

1169
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:24.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I just kept saying I didn't,</v>

1170
00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:29.801
<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a memoir and you're </v>

1171
00:53:29.801 --> 00:53:29.801
<v Speaker 2>misunderstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And finally I just decided to own it.</v>

1172
00:53:29.801 --> 00:53:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1173
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.080
<v Speaker 2>it is just a memoir that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a proud strict mom and then </v>

1174
00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:36.080
<v Speaker 2>things got a little bit better.</v>

1175
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:38.520
<v Speaker 2>But I think somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person said,</v>

1176
00:53:38.521 --> 00:53:39.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amy,</v>

1177
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:44.031
<v Speaker 2>I think that if the book had been about </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a strict Italian mom or strict </v>

1178
00:53:44.031 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Romanian bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody would have cared.</v>

1179
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:50.450
<v Speaker 2>It was at that moment that I hit fear of</v>
<v Speaker 2>parenting and fear of China at the exact</v>

1180
00:53:51.491 --> 00:53:53.720
<v Speaker 2>same moment because that was when all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1181
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.990
<v Speaker 2>those test scores came out and the US </v>
<v Speaker 2>this great superpowers,</v>

1182
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:58.170
<v Speaker 2>like at number 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

1183
00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.280
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Singapore,</v>

1184
00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.420
<v Speaker 2>and they were all like one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1185
00:54:00.421 --> 00:54:01.230
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was going to,</v>

1186
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:02.810
<v Speaker 2>they're going to eat our lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1187
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:04.950
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think also</v>

1188
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Greek tiger mom would have been more </v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1189
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.410
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but going to your point,</v>

1190
00:54:09.411 --> 00:54:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I think it did fill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People said it touched a nerve.</v>

1191
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:16.640
<v Speaker 2>It's often where there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing already.</v>

1192
00:54:16.641 --> 00:54:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Like people need something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a vacuum,</v>

1193
00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:21.110
<v Speaker 2>something's off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pendulum has swung too far.</v>

1194
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you,</v>

1195
00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:25.220
<v Speaker 2>this random thing comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fills a void.</v>

1196
00:54:25.221 --> 00:54:28.310
<v Speaker 2>So I think it could be a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar phenomenon.</v>

1197
00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:34.060
<v Speaker 3>A quit apologizing in a way that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan is saying on some level.</v>

1198
00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:36.250
<v Speaker 3>Quit apologizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just be who you are,</v>

1199
00:54:36.251 --> 00:54:39.340
<v Speaker 3>set the rules and have goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And don't apologize for it.</v>

1200
00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:41.500
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of people going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1201
00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:42.520
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>

1202
00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be successful and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna apologize for it.</v>

1203
00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:45.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1204
00:54:45.731 --> 00:54:50.731
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we do about that set of people </v>

1205
00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:54.121
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is just looking to take everybody </v>

1206
00:54:54.121 --> 00:54:55.390
<v Speaker 3>down because I that that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>overcorrection crew,</v>

1207
00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:58.600
<v Speaker 3>but they're not going to just go one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to.</v>

1208
00:54:58.601 --> 00:55:03.601
<v Speaker 3>Restorative justice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Social justice is not restorative </v>

1209
00:55:03.601 --> 00:55:04.120
<v Speaker 3>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the Old Testament.</v>

1210
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Retributive justice lives must be </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed.</v>

1211
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:12.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to go down and grovel and then </v>

1212
00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:12.820
<v Speaker 3>we're going to destroy you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:55:12.821 --> 00:55:17.821
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why our friend people goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he calls it a this he calls this </v>

1214
00:55:17.821 --> 00:55:19.240
<v Speaker 3>social justice thing or this idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>secular religion.</v>

1215
00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:19.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1216
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what I believe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1217
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:22.660
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Original sin,</v>

1218
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.010
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your white male,</v>

1219
00:55:24.011 --> 00:55:26.110
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there is no.</v>

1220
00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:28.990
<v Speaker 3>There is no restorative justice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have to be destroyed.</v>

1221
00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:31.140
<v Speaker 3>So what can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1222
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:34.510
<v Speaker 3>it's a hard solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Push back and just say,</v>

1223
00:55:34.511 --> 00:55:35.140
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>

1224
00:55:35.141 --> 00:55:36.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1225
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:42.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I do something wrong I will </v>

1226
00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.471
<v Speaker 3>apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not gonna apologize for </v>

1227
00:55:43.471 --> 00:55:43.471
<v Speaker 3>something I didn't do or who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a white male.</v>

1228
00:55:43.471 --> 00:55:47.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should I apologize for that very </v>

1229
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:50.521
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you made the decision not to </v>

1230
00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:50.530
<v Speaker 3>apologize anymore to stand up for </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

1231
00:55:50.531 --> 00:55:55.531
<v Speaker 3>how quickly did it all kind of stopped?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think that's what a lot of </v>

1232
00:55:55.531 --> 00:55:55.720
<v Speaker 3>people that are watching this are </v>
<v Speaker 3>wondering.</v>

1233
00:55:55.740 --> 00:56:00.740
<v Speaker 3>They're afraid to say anything because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to just get caught in </v>

1234
00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.000
<v Speaker 3>that meat grinder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want to show them instances of,</v>

1235
00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:05.650
<v Speaker 3>because every one of us that has stood </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and said,</v>

1236
00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.070
<v Speaker 3>we're here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not just going to bow to you.</v>

1237
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.070
<v Speaker 3>We've made it eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not</v>

1238
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:16.070
<v Speaker 2>a huge fan of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure what these </v>

1239
00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:16.070
<v Speaker 2>apologies accomplish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a way I,</v>

1240
00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:16.620
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1241
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see things through a tribal leds,</v>

1242
00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:20.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's like a,</v>

1243
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:21.410
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a victory.</v>

1244
00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:22.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1245
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.500
<v Speaker 2>trophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an apology.</v>

1246
00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:25.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to extract this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1247
00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:26.770
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1248
00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.390
<v Speaker 2>it was more of myself to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1249
00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1250
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:33.130
<v Speaker 2>to just kind of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

1251
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I've made a lot of mistakes if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually read the book,</v>

1252
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:39.960
<v Speaker 2>who realize it's about my younger </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter rebelling and it's funny and </v>

1253
00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 2>there whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unreliable narrators,</v>

1254
00:56:40.211 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 2>but you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually pretty proud.</v>

1255
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty proud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Standby everything.</v>

1256
00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:48.370
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1257
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hugely empowered,</v>

1258
00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:53.320
<v Speaker 2>hugely empowering psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1259
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.680
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play devil's advocate on the bigger </v>

1260
00:56:58.680 --> 00:56:58.680
<v Speaker 2>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we all need to elevate ourselves</v>

1261
00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.790
<v Speaker 2>because I'm sort of in a different camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you guys.</v>

1262
00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm looking at the country inn </v>
<v Speaker 2>where and as the optimist,</v>

1263
00:57:04.241 --> 00:57:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1264
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:11.340
<v Speaker 2>that's why I admired Michael so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's hard to recognize yourself as </v>

1265
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:16.060
<v Speaker 2>being somebody that's being tribal or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the US versus them always.</v>

1266
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:21.390
<v Speaker 2>And what I have noticed because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to me is one bad thing happens </v>

1267
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Speaker 2>to you because we've all had this some </v>
<v Speaker 2>just terrible attack,</v>

1268
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:26.620
<v Speaker 2>very cruel thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly unfair.</v>

1269
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:30.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get so angry at the other side,</v>

1270
00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:32.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And rightfully so.</v>

1271
00:57:32.171 --> 00:57:36.550
<v Speaker 2>I think the warning I would have is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people do put in the them category.</v>

1272
00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I think we should all narrow that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it smaller,</v>

1273
00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:45.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are these big labels and </v>

1274
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:45.420
<v Speaker 2>people do it on all sides and I even do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1275
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:49.831
<v Speaker 2>I just get so mad at this massive pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people that I think of as my enemies </v>

1276
00:57:49.961 --> 00:57:51.700
<v Speaker 2>because something horrible just happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

1277
00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:53.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was something incredibly insulting or</v>

1278
00:57:53.471 --> 00:57:56.290
<v Speaker 2>this terrible stuff that I get on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

1279
00:57:56.291 --> 00:57:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all get the hate.</v>

1280
00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so easy just to hate back I </v>

1281
00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:03.560
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the hard thing.</v>

1282
00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:04.450
<v Speaker 2>So actually I think he narrowed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy.</v>

1283
00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:05.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1284
00:58:05.841 --> 00:58:10.841
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to conservative talk </v>

1285
00:58:10.841 --> 00:58:10.841
<v Speaker 3>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh,</v>

1286
00:58:10.841 --> 00:58:10.880
<v Speaker 3>it's just so polarized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1287
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:12.050
<v Speaker 3>every other word is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1288
00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:13.370
<v Speaker 3>the liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left,</v>

1289
00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:15.180
<v Speaker 3>the Lib,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tards yards,</v>

1290
00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1291
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:19.390
<v Speaker 3>the New York slimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Washington composed,</v>

1292
00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:24.320
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife calls him the screamer.</v>

1293
00:58:24.321 --> 00:58:27.320
<v Speaker 3>She's Germany's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are these people in the radio screaming?</v>

1294
00:58:27.321 --> 00:58:28.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what gets ratings.</v>

1295
00:58:28.701 --> 00:58:31.700
<v Speaker 3>Apparently they're just as bad as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the left.</v>

1296
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:32.330
<v Speaker 3>India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1297
00:58:32.331 --> 00:58:33.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to stop doing this,</v>

1298
00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:39.100
<v Speaker 3>that the principle of charity just be </v>
<v Speaker 3>charitable to the person you're talking </v>

1299
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:39.440
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't assume you know,</v>

1300
00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.380
<v Speaker 3>because they slipped up and used this </v>
<v Speaker 3>word instead of that word.</v>

1301
00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Therefore they're Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more reductive ad hilarity.</v>

1302
00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:48.800
<v Speaker 3>You have to stop that.</v>

1303
00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 1>So do you think it's possible to wrap </v>
<v Speaker 1>this up on a nice boat and use a little </v>

1304
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:57.221
<v Speaker 1>of our optimism here and a little of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or moral arc here that the exhaustion </v>

1305
00:58:57.561 --> 00:59:02.561
<v Speaker 1>with all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of these conversations that </v>

1306
00:59:02.561 --> 00:59:03.290
<v Speaker 1>actually clearly are breaking into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream at the moment and all of that</v>

1307
00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:08.590
<v Speaker 1>will lead to a sort of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>realignment where it seems to me that I </v>

1308
00:59:08.691 --> 00:59:13.691
<v Speaker 1>would argue at this point we basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed trump even though I didn't vote </v>

1309
00:59:13.691 --> 00:59:16.931
<v Speaker 1>for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we needed him for this now for years of </v>

1310
00:59:16.931 --> 00:59:19.151
<v Speaker 1>just upheaval and fertile ground and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and people realigning their </v>

1311
00:59:19.151 --> 00:59:20.810
<v Speaker 1>thinking and strange alliances and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1312
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:24.350
<v Speaker 1>But that what we can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need another trump after.</v>

1313
00:59:24.351 --> 00:59:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everything actually goes okay,</v>

1314
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 1>we will actually be okay with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>decent again,</v>

1315
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:34.130
<v Speaker 1>but we needed the thing to be shook up </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we could get there.</v>

1316
00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an optimist for the say I,</v>

1317
00:59:36.741 --> 00:59:37.670
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1318
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.070
<v Speaker 2>and it's very hard to say people are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry.</v>

1319
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:45.071
<v Speaker 2>So there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also possible that it's completely </v>

1320
00:59:45.071 --> 00:59:45.071
<v Speaker 2>the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

1321
00:59:45.071 --> 00:59:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1322
00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also,</v>

1323
00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:51.131
<v Speaker 2>we started with the masterpiece cake </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and I said I'm not a college </v>

1324
00:59:51.131 --> 00:59:51.131
<v Speaker 2>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1325
00:59:51.131 --> 00:59:53.510
<v Speaker 2>I've been giving talks a lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>

1326
00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:54.980
<v Speaker 2>is there another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a model?</v>

1327
00:59:55.010 --> 01:00:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Is there a country that you've studied </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be the model for us to get </v>

1328
01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:02.420
<v Speaker 2>out of our political tribalism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually this is actually could even</v>

1329
01:00:02.421 --> 01:00:03.740
<v Speaker 2>get me in trouble because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1330
01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.780
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just say we're the model.</v>

1331
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.680
<v Speaker 2>We are the bottle we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that we're per,</v>

1332
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:09.860
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1333
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:14.950
<v Speaker 2>we have made so many mistakes that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very bad moment in many ways,</v>

1334
01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 2>but we have the apparatus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have something special.</v>

1335
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.630
<v Speaker 2>This thing of that I call the super good</v>
<v Speaker 2>context,</v>

1336
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:22.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our constitution,</v>

1337
01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.970
<v Speaker 2>of course we have repeatedly failed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live up to those ideals,</v>

1338
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:31.150
<v Speaker 2>but the ideals are there and this is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnically and religiously neutral </v>

1339
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:33.950
<v Speaker 2>document.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1340
01:00:33.951 --> 01:00:37.180
<v Speaker 2>not the way it's played out in reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>is always the,</v>

1341
01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:39.350
<v Speaker 2>our ideals have always exceeded our </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

1342
01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:45.110
<v Speaker 2>So it's an aspirational country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an aspirational document and this </v>

1343
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:45.110
<v Speaker 2>is why we come full circle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1344
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:47.360
<v Speaker 2>I think we're worthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enlightenment experiment.</v>

1345
01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought,</v>

1346
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>and this is where maybe I was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody that you remember in the late </v>

1347
01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.420
<v Speaker 2>nineties when the Berlin Wall came down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1348
01:00:56.421 --> 01:01:01.421
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be one world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe Saudi Arabia and Turkey will join </v>

1349
01:01:01.421 --> 01:01:01.640
<v Speaker 2>the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That navy,</v>

1350
01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:04.850
<v Speaker 2>the United States will join the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always like,</v>

1351
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:09.970
<v Speaker 2>never too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm still a little bit of a tribalist</v>

1352
01:01:11.031 --> 01:01:14.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that I think the world at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point is too big a unit.</v>

1353
01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1354
01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Well you use figuring out that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that are in Europe.</v>

1355
01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right about.</v>

1356
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm really glad that that'll be a </v>

1357
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>good place to wrap this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1358
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>that you mentioned he's aspirational </v>
<v Speaker 1>documents because as you guys can see </v>

1359
01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>through our window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in there in our control room,</v>

1360
01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:31.460
<v Speaker 1>we've got an American flag in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also what you can see,</v>

1361
01:01:31.461 --> 01:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amy's,</v>

1362
01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I just got these two huge print giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>print of the declaration of independence</v>

1363
01:01:36.771 --> 01:01:40.550
<v Speaker 1>and a giant print of the constitution </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was given at a,</v>

1364
01:01:40.551 --> 01:01:42.770
<v Speaker 1>at a speaking thing that I did for three</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning point.</v>

1365
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:48.160
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't always lived up to those </v>

1366
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:48.160
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we could get back to that,</v>

1367
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>that's why I care about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always tweeting about these things </v>

1368
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>and when I'm in D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>

1369
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I go and I take pictures of all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and put up,</v>

1370
01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what Thomas Jefferson said,</v>

1371
01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:58.340
<v Speaker 1>that they've given us the blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that they were perfect.</v>

1372
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that we've always done </v>
<v Speaker 1>it right.</v>

1373
01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:04.930
<v Speaker 1>But this idea that someone do it better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than us for as bad as it may seem,</v>

1374
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:06.980
<v Speaker 1>we're not killing each other in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets right now.</v>

1375
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

1376
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>They're unjust murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1377
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Is there just this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still pretty damn good.</v>

1378
01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:15.900
<v Speaker 1>If we were going to bring it home </v>
<v Speaker 1>schermer well,</v>

1379
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned being a multiplanetary </v>
<v Speaker 1>species when we call an Eis Mars</v>

1380
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.700
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

1381
01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 3>We got to set up some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

1382
01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:24.950
<v Speaker 3>some kind of economic system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1383
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 3>What documents would you bring?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1384
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:32.721
<v Speaker 3>the declaration of independence and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitution that that would be the </v>

1385
01:02:32.721 --> 01:02:35.931
<v Speaker 3>place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they'll tweak it and experiment </v>

1386
01:02:35.931 --> 01:02:36.450
<v Speaker 3>and then it'll get a little bit better </v>
<v Speaker 3>or worse,</v>

1387
01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:38.370
<v Speaker 3>and then we can look at that as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment and go,</v>

1388
01:02:38.371 --> 01:02:39.810
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what we should do here,</v>

1389
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:45.530
<v Speaker 3>but that also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that perspective also gives us that </v>

1390
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Sagan esque Pale blue dot look back at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth and go,</v>

1391
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:51.470
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are no borders from Mars is just </v>

1392
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:52.710
<v Speaker 3>this blue dot and maybe that'll change </v>
<v Speaker 3>our perspective.</v>

1393
01:02:52.711 --> 01:02:55.620
<v Speaker 3>A little bit about the tribal nature of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our species.</v>

1394
01:02:55.970 --> 01:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe my new argument when people are </v>

1395
01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>telling me how horrible America is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1396
01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:02.630
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were on a Mars tomorrow,</v>

1397
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.700
<v Speaker 1>we're going somewhere tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a better document that to start </v>

1398
01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.470
<v Speaker 1>us off with and I'm pretty sure nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have something better.</v>

1399
01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1400
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.050
<v Speaker 1>they probably wouldn't know what to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that would be.</v>

1401
01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:17.310
<v Speaker 1>That'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you could do something to finish </v>
