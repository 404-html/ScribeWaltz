1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.333
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about college and education </v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:05.394
<v Speaker 1>this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the best way to dive into this </v>

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>discussion is to first tell you guys a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about my own personal experience.</v>

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.183
<v Speaker 1>I went to public school in Long Island </v>
<v Speaker 1>from kindergarten through high school </v>

5
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:14.514
<v Speaker 1>and then onto binghamton university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York actually has a pretty great </v>

6
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>college system for decades and since I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a resident,</v>

7
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>tuition was discounted to just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraction of what most colleges costs.</v>

8
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:25.494
<v Speaker 1>Now I got a solid education at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>affordable public school and have used </v>

9
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:29.784
<v Speaker 1>my degree in political science to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you all tuned in to see me </v>

10
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:33.984
<v Speaker 1>do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was my education that led me to </v>

11
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>guiding conversations about important </v>
<v Speaker 1>topics with interesting people.</v>

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I will spend a lot of time in college </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot and listening to fish.</v>

13
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.153
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's another story for another </v>

14
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This show has been devoted to discussing</v>

15
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>That very concept is rooted in a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>education in which you can question what</v>

17
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:54.294
<v Speaker 1>you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the number one reason to go to </v>

18
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn how to think critically.</v>

19
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.053
<v Speaker 1>When we talk about a battle of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only have that battle when </v>

20
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:03.894
<v Speaker 1>people know what their ideas are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually based on when we talk about </v>

21
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:08.064
<v Speaker 1>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only really talk about knowing </v>

22
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>why free speech is important and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to societies that don't have it.</v>

23
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>When we talk about the dysfunction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our political process,</v>

24
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.343
<v Speaker 1>you can really only understand it if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the basic tenants of how it was </v>

25
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:22.974
<v Speaker 1>designed to work in the first place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about the complex issues </v>

26
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:26.724
<v Speaker 1>facing the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really only understand them if </v>

27
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you know the history of the countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people living there.</v>

28
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I didn't learn all of these things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>

29
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:34.374
<v Speaker 1>but the foundation of having my ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged and learning new things </v>

30
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>absolutely was built.</v>

31
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.743
<v Speaker 1>Their learning is something I try to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this show each week and it's why I </v>

32
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>have no problem telling you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know everything and I don't have</v>

33
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>all the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this very moment.</v>

34
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:49.104
<v Speaker 1>The American education system and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleges in particular are under total </v>

35
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:53.304
<v Speaker 1>assault from the backwards forces on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left who don't want open discussion and </v>

36
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.284
<v Speaker 1>would rather stifle ideas they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like such as critiquing a certain </v>

37
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.154
<v Speaker 1>religion or questioning the motives of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the social justice movement because of </v>

38
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:06.384
<v Speaker 1>the authoritarian crusade to shelter </v>
<v Speaker 1>young people from ideas that might </v>

39
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:10.044
<v Speaker 1>challenge them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've created safe spaces where we once </v>

40
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:13.434
<v Speaker 1>had rigorous debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We now issue trigger warnings where we </v>

41
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>once were brave enough to hear ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make us uncomfortable.</v>

42
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>The attack on the honest debate has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten so bad.</v>

43
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:23.544
<v Speaker 1>It is now hard to tell if this </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual affliction is coming from </v>

44
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:27.414
<v Speaker 1>the students or from the faculty between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the professor calling for muscle to </v>

45
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.484
<v Speaker 1>remove press from a demonstration at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Missouri to students </v>

46
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:36.564
<v Speaker 1>demanding the dean be fired at Yale for </v>
<v Speaker 1>defending the freedom of expression to </v>

47
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:40.734
<v Speaker 1>my former guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo yiannopoulos being shouted down </v>

48
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>while talking about free speech at </v>
<v Speaker 1>rutgers just two weeks ago.</v>

49
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>The tentacles of intolerance are taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>root at colleges all across America,</v>

50
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>and it's the ideas which take root </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

51
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>That will be the ideas that lead us into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

52
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:56.904
<v Speaker 1>That's the real risk here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We must be willing to exercise our free </v>

53
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:00.994
<v Speaker 1>speech more thoughtfully than to only </v>
<v Speaker 1>use it to prevent other people from </v>

54
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:05.134
<v Speaker 1>exercising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's we have a right to free speech </v>

55
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a right to not be offended.</v>

56
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>My guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just last week,</v>

57
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro just had a speech about </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism at cal State University,</v>

58
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>canceled after leftist activist </v>
<v Speaker 1>protested his presence on campus.</v>

59
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>The school president said that Ben would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be invited back,</v>

60
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>but as part of a panel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when more diverse views can be heard,</v>

61
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>well that concept doesn't sound terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and of itself.</v>

62
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's really understand what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

63
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>When the authoritarians be they on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left or on the right,</v>

64
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>when they like your views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can speak freely and there's no need</v>

65
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 1>for counter voices.</v>

66
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>When they don't like your views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you will be screamed at or outright</v>

67
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.034
<v Speaker 1>canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is dangerous and it's happening </v>

68
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:50.780
<v Speaker 1>more and more every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat here for over an hour with Ben and</v>

69
00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>although I didn't agree with him on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>array of topics,</v>

70
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I listened and I learned from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>response we got on the episode,</v>

71
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.034
<v Speaker 1>so did many of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if all you learned was that you </v>

72
00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.494
<v Speaker 1>completely disagree with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what conversation is all about </v>

73
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>and it's that precious space where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to think on your own,</v>

74
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher education is supposed to be.</v>

75
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>College is the single most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>place where ideas must be challenged.</v>

76
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.454
<v Speaker 1>As I say all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the battle of ideas happen and the </v>

77
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>good ones will eventually win by </v>
<v Speaker 1>slandering opponents,</v>

78
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>demanding professors be fired and </v>
<v Speaker 1>canceling speaking events.</v>

79
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.233
<v Speaker 1>These college kids are unwittingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthening ideas that will one day </v>

80
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>silence of them.</v>

81
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.063
<v Speaker 1>Eventually the day will come when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to say something that's considered </v>

82
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:33.214
<v Speaker 1>unpopular and they will then be </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjected to the same practices that </v>

83
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>they themselves are propagating right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

84
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.873
<v Speaker 1>The second they leave the safety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their college quad and are hit with the </v>

85
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:43.714
<v Speaker 1>harsh reality of the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll be ill prepared to deal with </v>

86
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:47.134
<v Speaker 1>anyone who doesn't share their myopic </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of how things should be to help me </v>

87
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>dissect this crisis and that's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>

88
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>is Professor Gad said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is an author,</v>

89
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:57.544
<v Speaker 1>professor and evolutionary behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists at the John Molson School of </v>

90
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>business at Concordia University in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal,</v>

91
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:05.044
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is also a fearless defender of free </v>

92
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:07.894
<v Speaker 1>speech and an outspoken advocate of free</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression in an academic climate that </v>

93
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 1>doesn't look too kindly on these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These days.</v>

94
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.423
<v Speaker 1>We're going to dive deep into what has </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened at college campuses all over </v>

95
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 1>the world and why free speech must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>defended at all costs.</v>

96
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in your safe space.</v>

97
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:25.294
<v Speaker 1>You've been triggered war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's exercise some of that free </v>

98
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:32.161
<v Speaker 1>speech while we still have it set as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>

99
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube Creator,</v>

100
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:35.884
<v Speaker 1>defender of free speech and secular </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas known as the godfather and he's </v>

101
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:41.284
<v Speaker 1>spreading the sad truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're going to spread a little </v>

102
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 1>of it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for having me again.</v>

103
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.293
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very excited to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that to all my guests because I'm </v>

104
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:51.760
<v Speaker 1>always excited to talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I particularly mean it today because</v>

105
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:56.761
<v Speaker 1>you joined me for the first test show a </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way back in August.</v>

106
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that</v>

107
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.843
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris was the first guest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but technically Gad sad was the first </v>

108
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:04.210
<v Speaker 2>repeat guest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you now are the first.</v>

109
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 2>You were the first guest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were the first repeat guest and,</v>

110
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 2>and you're doing so much cool stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this space.</v>

111
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of,</v>

112
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:12.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

113
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 2>what do we want to call ourselves now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What space are we in?</v>

114
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Fighters have good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

115
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Fighters have good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

116
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 2>so I want to get into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

117
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 2>the work that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about your books.</v>

118
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about your tweets and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to talk about your youtube channel,</v>

119
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.840
<v Speaker 2>but I saw you do an interview with </v>
<v Speaker 2>astronaut Omani.</v>

120
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was really,</v>

121
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk about your history.</v>

122
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 2>So you were born in Lebanon and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to let you take it away.</v>

123
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Sam was born in Lebanon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 19,</v>

124
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 2>late 1964.</v>

125
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.610
<v Speaker 2>So now everybody knows my age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

126
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.573
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived there for 11 years and then the </v>

127
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 2>civil war broke out in the mid </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>

128
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>It became very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to be Jewish in Lebanon.</v>

129
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.793
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we really had to leave under </v>

130
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 2>imminent threat of execution in Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody carries an internal ID card,</v>

131
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.260
<v Speaker 2>very much like a passport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for,</v>

132
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.193
<v Speaker 2>for the country itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on that ID card is stated very </v>

133
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:09.764
<v Speaker 2>clearly what your religion is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you are stopped at particular </v>

134
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:17.831
<v Speaker 2>roadblocks by militia who were not </v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathetic to you being Jewish,</v>

135
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't going to turn out well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you might imagine,</v>

136
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:22.410
<v Speaker 2>most of the militia at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

137
00:07:22.411 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have cleared those </v>
<v Speaker 2>roadblocks.</v>

138
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 2>And so we really needed to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we left Lebanon,</v>

139
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.303
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day that we left Lebanon and we </v>

140
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:32.320
<v Speaker 2>cleared the airspace of A.</v>

141
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lebanon,</v>

142
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the captain had mentioned that,</v>

143
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife and my wife,</v>

144
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 2>my mother takes out a star of David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts it around my neck and says,</v>

145
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 2>now you don't have to hide who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

146
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:44.354
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's back up before we get to your </v>

147
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 2>escape because of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your escape.</v>

148
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:50.480
<v Speaker 2>There was some pretty amazing stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

149
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:55.120
<v Speaker 2>So your parents were kidnapped by PLO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrorists later.</v>

150
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

151
00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 2>we emigrated to Canada and late 75 then </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the next four years,</v>

152
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 2>my parents kept going back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Montreal to Lebanon.</v>

153
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.443
<v Speaker 2>They really couldn't extricate </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves fully from their previous </v>

154
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 2>life in Lebanon and on one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>trips in 1980,</v>

155
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.510
<v Speaker 2>there were kidnapped by a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

156
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.920
<v Speaker 2>You had a guest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no relation,</v>

157
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 2>no relation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no relation,</v>

158
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 2>but Fatah is sort of now it's considered</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moderate version.</v>

159
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.330
<v Speaker 2>The moderate to Hamas.</v>

160
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.670
<v Speaker 2>Moderate in the Middle East is a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>attentive term.</v>

161
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they were kidnapped.</v>

162
00:08:30.231 --> 00:08:31.064
<v Speaker 2>They disappeared for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was eight days at the time </v>

163
00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 2>that it was happening when my siblings </v>
<v Speaker 2>are much older than me,</v>

164
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.833
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to find a way to rescue </v>
<v Speaker 2>them or even know if they're still </v>

165
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been lied to.</v>

166
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I was told that they had some financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

167
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 2>That's why there was so much upheaval in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the house.</v>

168
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.630
<v Speaker 2>So during those eight days or my parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>had disappeared,</v>

169
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that they were potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

170
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.443
<v Speaker 2>What they were finally rescued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were rescued actually because my </v>

171
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:01.810
<v Speaker 2>mother's best friend at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her name was,</v>

172
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.243
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the personal dresser of half as an </v>

173
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 2>asset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so through those connections we were</v>

174
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 2>able to pinpoint which militia group had</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

175
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 2>And I guess was he the president of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of Syria,</v>

176
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 2>the president of Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Syria.</v>

177
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.173
<v Speaker 2>And then through him I think a Yasser </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arafat got involved and finally they </v>

178
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:25.040
<v Speaker 2>found them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were with a group led by Don.</v>

179
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm going on my memory here from when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was 15.</v>

180
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

181
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were rescued.</v>

182
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might remember from the story with,</v>

183
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my discussion with Astro,</v>

184
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when my parents were eventually rescued,</v>

185
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:39.923
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father had a severe injury from </v>

186
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:42.954
<v Speaker 2>having been beaten with a coalition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cove and he had a temporary stroke </v>

187
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.740
<v Speaker 2>paralysis in his face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which eventually subsided.</v>

188
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.023
<v Speaker 2>And in my mother's case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that one of the things that </v>

189
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:54.054
<v Speaker 2>had really disturbed me as a 15 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>young male was whether she had been </v>

190
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.313
<v Speaker 2>raped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember that shortly after they </v>

191
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 2>were rescued and came back to Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked her,</v>

192
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:08.454
<v Speaker 2>the only time I've ever brought up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject and she said that while they </v>

193
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 2>repeatedly threatened her </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically would rape,</v>

194
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.680
<v Speaker 2>that they hadn't raped her.</v>

195
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.633
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if that's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just sort of dropped the subject and </v>

196
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 2>never raised it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

197
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know that you can know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer to this,</v>

198
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 2>but what were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were they trying to get out of your</v>

199
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:27.720
<v Speaker 2>brain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the advantage of,</v>

200
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.330
<v Speaker 2>of taking x pats that were now Canadians</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kidnapping?</v>

201
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

202
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:33.803
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the seven deadly sins of </v>

203
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.380
<v Speaker 2>greed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

204
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.453
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the owner of a building where my father </v>

205
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:45.141
<v Speaker 2>had a store in the lobby was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>low ball my father to sell the store and</v>

206
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.520
<v Speaker 2>thinking that of course as Jews they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't a very precarious situation.</v>

207
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.350
<v Speaker 2>He had hired these militia to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>extract from them a confession that they</v>

208
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:59.970
<v Speaker 2>were Israeli spies and the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if they would then execute them</v>

209
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:03.900
<v Speaker 2>as Israeli spies somehow magically he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could get that sore.</v>

210
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.063
<v Speaker 2>Luckily for my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they didn't confess to that </v>

211
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:07.674
<v Speaker 2>because they're not Israeli spies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what kept them alive for those </v>

212
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:10.824
<v Speaker 2>eight days because there was an ulterior</v>
<v Speaker 2>motive to get them to sign those </v>

213
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 2>confessions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

214
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.333
<v Speaker 2>that's really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I know why I jumped ahead with </v>

215
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:18.174
<v Speaker 2>the story about your parents because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened to you getting out of </v>

216
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.373
<v Speaker 2>Lebanon I thought was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you were talking about going through </v>

217
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:27.620
<v Speaker 2>the checkpoints and being in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

218
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 2>And you have a very foggy memory of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

219
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:30.954
<v Speaker 2>So I remember very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well actually we had hired PLO </v>

220
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.411
<v Speaker 2>militia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

221
00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:36.150
<v Speaker 2>you think about the guys that you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

222
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.800
<v Speaker 2>the Isis guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they look?</v>

223
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

224
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.743
<v Speaker 2>that's what I grew up with now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys were contracted to drive us </v>

225
00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:45.840
<v Speaker 2>to the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

226
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 2>precisely because by close to the baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>with international airport,</v>

227
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.823
<v Speaker 2>there were a lot of militia checkpoints </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Palestinians and there was no way </v>

228
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.970
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get through that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they weren't sympathetic to,</v>

229
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.290
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

230
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.123
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course they could take you and </v>

231
00:11:58.751 --> 00:11:59.584
<v Speaker 2>they can take it to the ditch and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>you so you don't really know what's </v>

232
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:02.284
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I remember being picked up by these </v>

233
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:05.074
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember getting to the airport and </v>

234
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 2>then the story would end up on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plane,</v>

235
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 2>but everything in between I have zero </v>
<v Speaker 2>recollection of that.</v>

236
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 2>And I once asked my parents what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and she said that,</v>

237
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we were going through different </v>

238
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods that would have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>hostile to Palestinian militia,</v>

239
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian groups,</v>

240
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.970
<v Speaker 2>everybody was engaging one another very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much like a Rambo movie.</v>

241
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 2>We were at the bottom of the floor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the car,</v>

242
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 2>sort of being hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that.</v>

243
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.330
<v Speaker 2>I have zero recollection of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

244
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.253
<v Speaker 2>It's so fascinating because it shows you</v>
<v Speaker 2>how complex the entire situation with </v>

245
00:12:39.401 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Lebanon and the Palestinians and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israelis is because you had,</v>

246
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.833
<v Speaker 2>you had Palestinian militia people being</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid off to help Jews escaped Lebanon </v>

247
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 2>because of their civil war.</v>

248
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:50.681
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really.</v>

249
00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:52.210
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you map this whole thing,</v>

250
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 2>people will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this makes no sense.</v>

251
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

252
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I've actually written about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

253
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims were trying to kill us and </v>

254
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Muslims saved us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

255
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:03.550
<v Speaker 2>So you can sort of have a blanket </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement,</v>

256
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all Muslims,</v>

257
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:05.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an.</v>

258
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.943
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't believe in all Muslims are </v>

259
00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

260
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That outright they're getting.</v>

261
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Because we don't want you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He misquoted.</v>

262
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 2>So you must feel a sort of very strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>when a right now,</v>

263
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hezbollah is sort of taking over Lebanon</v>

264
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:20.194
<v Speaker 2>and they're fighting in Syria and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>your home country and it's teetering on </v>

265
00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:25.780
<v Speaker 2>democracy or it's democracy I should </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

266
00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:27.200
<v Speaker 2>is teetering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

267
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.100
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about Lebanon now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might be with you.</v>

268
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I do so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

269
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:31.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

270
00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I have two children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

271
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:36.070
<v Speaker 2>so between my wife and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we speak five languages,</v>

272
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 2>so I speak French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>

273
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Arabic and Hebrew.</v>

274
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 2>She speaks English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>French and Armenian,</v>

275
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.053
<v Speaker 2>and yet our children only speak French </v>
<v Speaker 2>and English because by virtue of living </v>

276
00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:47.614
<v Speaker 2>in Montreal and I really regret the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we don't have the opportunity to </v>

277
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:52.480
<v Speaker 2>take our children back to Lebanon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

278
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 2>one year visiting professorship at </v>
<v Speaker 2>American University of Beirut,</v>

279
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumped them in that context.</v>

280
00:13:57.791 --> 00:13:59.500
<v Speaker 2>They could come back fluent Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaker,</v>

281
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.150
<v Speaker 2>speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you do it?</v>

282
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Is there because because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political situation or you know,</v>

283
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:05.563
<v Speaker 2>and in Beirut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make a left turn here than there </v>

284
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:09.723
<v Speaker 2>is an isis recruitment center perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean you don't know who's the Nice </v>

285
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.911
<v Speaker 2>Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the bad guy,</v>

286
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:13.744
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't take much for people to find </v>

287
00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:16.390
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

288
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:18.010
<v Speaker 2>that I'm Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number two,</v>

289
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:20.620
<v Speaker 2>that I've written quite forcefully about</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these issues.</v>

290
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.820
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy for you to disappear in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trunk of a car.</v>

291
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable</v>

292
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:28.114
<v Speaker 2>given the current situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cigarettes now I've been told I have a </v>

293
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:31.330
<v Speaker 2>lot of friends that have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

294
00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 2>we can guarantee your security come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

295
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Can you really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

296
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.243
<v Speaker 2>so I'd rather not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly not when I have young </v>

297
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:38.284
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

298
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.870
<v Speaker 2>So before the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know you were,</v>

299
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.030
<v Speaker 2>you were 12 when it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you were pretty young.</v>

300
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:43.864
<v Speaker 2>11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>

301
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

302
00:14:45.171 --> 00:14:47.830
<v Speaker 2>what was it like to be Jewish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was actually.</v>

303
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

304
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 2>that's a very issue because oftentimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>people will say,</v>

305
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Jews were treated very nicely.</v>

306
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:54.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

307
00:14:54.891 --> 00:14:55.724
<v Speaker 2>nicely in the sense that they aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>daily decapitations the square and </v>

308
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.260
<v Speaker 2>central square,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

309
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.293
<v Speaker 2>You could go about your business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everything is nice until the </v>

310
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:06.620
<v Speaker 2>decapitations happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

311
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.010
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

312
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 2>you were tolerated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

313
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people knew you were Jewish.</v>

314
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 2>They didn't necessarily bother you </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday,</v>

315
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.443
<v Speaker 2>but antisemitism pervades the fabric of </v>
<v Speaker 2>every possible element of society in </v>

316
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:21.554
<v Speaker 2>those regions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean that everybody's </v>

317
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.840
<v Speaker 2>an antisemite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

318
00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.300
<v Speaker 2>you just be quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

319
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.810
<v Speaker 2>don't signal your belongingness to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

320
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Be understated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

321
00:15:31.671 --> 00:15:34.610
<v Speaker 2>And then once the civil war happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the rules were just changed,</v>

322
00:15:34.611 --> 00:15:35.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

323
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.043
<v Speaker 2>is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically you guys felt that whatever </v>

324
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:40.230
<v Speaker 2>side wins this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're finished.</v>

325
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:41.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

326
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.363
<v Speaker 2>there were Jews that were killed and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have only been a matter of time </v>

327
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:47.480
<v Speaker 2>where somebody would have found us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed us.</v>

328
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.180
<v Speaker 2>So it really was under imminent threat </v>
<v Speaker 2>of execution.</v>

329
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:51.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we either get out or that.</v>

330
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know that a certain amount of </v>

331
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:54.620
<v Speaker 2>people will be watching this and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

332
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:55.454
<v Speaker 2>well wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand because God is a </v>

333
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.443
<v Speaker 2>extremely outspoken atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's here repeated several times </v>

334
00:16:00.831 --> 00:16:01.664
<v Speaker 2>that you're Jewish.</v>

335
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.830
<v Speaker 2>How do you reconcile that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've met a few people on it,</v>

336
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:04.664
<v Speaker 2>had Ali Rizvi who's an atheist Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we talked about how he reconciles </v>

337
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:08.500
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

338
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.360
<v Speaker 2>and there's been a couple of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people where we,</v>

339
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.670
<v Speaker 2>the way I reconcile it for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you reconcile that?</v>

340
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.130
<v Speaker 2>So the way I would answer that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judaism,</v>

341
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.190
<v Speaker 2>or to be Jewish as a multifaceted </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>

342
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.950
<v Speaker 2>there's a cultural element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a historical element,</v>

343
00:16:21.951 --> 00:16:26.951
<v Speaker 2>there is a shared context history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just the shared history,</v>

344
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.890
<v Speaker 2>shared lineage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

345
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:35.480
<v Speaker 2>one of which is adherence to a set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious doctrines.</v>

346
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.460
<v Speaker 2>And so I could choose to ignore those </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrines and still say I do belong to a</v>

347
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:41.890
<v Speaker 2>group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

348
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.050
<v Speaker 2>that can be traced back in this manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>through genealogy.</v>

349
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in that sense,</v>

350
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm very Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

351
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.530
<v Speaker 2>but in the religious element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not at all Jewish.</v>

352
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:52.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you don't get a certain </v>

353
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 2>cred of being from the Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that?</v>

354
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.433
<v Speaker 2>Because there is a sense and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sit down and we followed the gosh a </v>

355
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:01.520
<v Speaker 2>little bit later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

356
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I've known him online for over a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

357
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:06.320
<v Speaker 2>because he said that he had Palestinian </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestry,</v>

358
00:17:06.321 --> 00:17:09.870
<v Speaker 2>I just assumed he was Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know until we met two weeks ago</v>

359
00:17:09.871 --> 00:17:10.704
<v Speaker 2>I had dinner that his family actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>was Christian and that was just a silly </v>

360
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.193
<v Speaker 2>and sloppy thinking on my part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you feel that you sort of don't </v>

361
00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:19.340
<v Speaker 2>get some of the credit of being a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle easterner?</v>

362
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on who you're speaking,</v>

363
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I guess from the people on the left that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spend so much time,</v>

364
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I break down the break,</v>

365
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.980
<v Speaker 2>break down with the flawless Arabic than</v>
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of concerns go away.</v>

366
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's,</v>

367
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.943
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite impressive for somebody to </v>

368
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:36.050
<v Speaker 2>accuse you of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when your mother.</v>

369
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything about us as Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

370
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:38.630
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we happen to be Jewish,</v>

371
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:40.190
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

372
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.010
<v Speaker 2>culturally we're were Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

373
00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:42.844
<v Speaker 2>with Arab Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very difficult for people to </v>

374
00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:45.374
<v Speaker 2>levy that charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I have interesting a personal </v>

375
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 2>anecdote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a graduate student,</v>

376
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.010
<v Speaker 2>a doctoral student at Cornell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

377
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I became friends with a lot of Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>

378
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.653
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as what typically happened because I </v>

379
00:17:58.051 --> 00:17:58.884
<v Speaker 2>have more in common with them than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>might have with the Jewish guy from </v>

380
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Poland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

381
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.320
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

382
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so at one point,</v>

383
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:07.200
<v Speaker 2>one of these guys who had gone for </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>

384
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.540
<v Speaker 2>he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

385
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:11.110
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked again.</v>

386
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.701
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

387
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:13.350
<v Speaker 2>why do you say that as though you're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprised?</v>

388
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

389
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

390
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.061
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:16.380
<v Speaker 2>because you're Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

392
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:18.340
<v Speaker 2>but you're not a Jew Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

393
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.453
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

394
00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:19.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

395
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Ju Ju Ju Ju.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

396
00:18:21.461 --> 00:18:21.871
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

397
00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:22.860
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not a Jew.</v>

398
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:23.694
<v Speaker 2>So in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was saying is you're not really </v>

399
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.723
<v Speaker 2>the archetype of what I imagined a Jew </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be you really Arabic and so it's the </v>

400
00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 2>opposite of what you asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all of this is so fascinating.</v>

401
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:33.984
<v Speaker 2>The reason I like talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar to what I was </v>

402
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:41.001
<v Speaker 2>discussing with Tara Fatah few days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That identity is so malleable actually.</v>

403
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.613
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily your religion or your </v>

404
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:47.214
<v Speaker 2>history or even your ethnicity or where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were born in nationality because </v>

405
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.983
<v Speaker 2>it's all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess that's why I hate identity </v>

406
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:58.341
<v Speaker 2>politics so much because I realize that </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people are like,</v>

407
00:18:58.711 --> 00:18:59.544
<v Speaker 2>you are like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pick and choose what to believe in </v>

408
00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:02.934
<v Speaker 2>and that secular values ultimately are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that should move us forward </v>

409
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:06.540
<v Speaker 2>as a society.</v>

410
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

411
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.640
<v Speaker 2>and privileged scores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should mention that.</v>

412
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I know you're privileged now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost some points because my skin is</v>

413
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:16.884
<v Speaker 2>a bit lighter that summer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've made sure to put on a bit of </v>

414
00:19:19.381 --> 00:19:22.020
<v Speaker 2>weight so that I could gain on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fattism score.</v>

415
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:27.130
<v Speaker 2>So it an in a homeostatic mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 2>whereby maintain my victimology score at</v>

416
00:19:27.391 --> 00:19:28.224
<v Speaker 2>a certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

417
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 2>But the but the fat thing is way lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the list than the other thing.</v>

418
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring it back and then the religion</v>
<v Speaker 2>things up here,</v>

419
00:19:35.011 --> 00:19:36.600
<v Speaker 2>depending on what religion is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a,</v>

420
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 2>people should be walking around with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cards and you just hand it to him and be</v>

421
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here's my shit.</v>

422
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:41.244
<v Speaker 2>And mother underprivileged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a thing on buzzfeed the other day </v>

423
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.330
<v Speaker 2>about privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see this one?</v>

424
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:47.910
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't say they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How privileged are you?</v>

425
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.540
<v Speaker 2>And I got a 42 out of hundreds that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't privileged at all.</v>

426
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Now it's it pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really.</v>

427
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I thought I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell people about.</v>

428
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm off the charts on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

429
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.560
<v Speaker 2>you'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd get a negative sick.</v>

430
00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

431
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

432
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.193
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to get some of your history </v>

433
00:20:01.891 --> 00:20:02.724
<v Speaker 2>out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's talk about what you're doing </v>

434
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:05.760
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

435
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:10.910
<v Speaker 2>so you are a professor and you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>research on your own and all that.</v>

436
00:20:11.371 --> 00:20:12.204
<v Speaker 2>We've got your book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consuming instincts as signed copy </v>

437
00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:15.504
<v Speaker 2>for you decided already signed that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I see it on Ebay as a means for you </v>

438
00:20:19.361 --> 00:20:23.190
<v Speaker 2>to try to fund your Malibu House,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be upset.</v>

439
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:23.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

440
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about the Malibu House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on it in other,</v>

441
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.570
<v Speaker 2>other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

442
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.960
<v Speaker 2>so tell me a little bit about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought you to the world of academic.</v>

443
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:31.973
<v Speaker 2>So I've always known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were two things that I was </v>

444
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.260
<v Speaker 2>really good at and interested in soccer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and studying books.</v>

445
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was certainly going quite a,</v>

446
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.920
<v Speaker 2>my soccer career was going quite well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I had some serious injuries and</v>

447
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 2>other circumstances that don't allow me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pursue that.</v>

448
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.450
<v Speaker 2>And so that accelerated my move to </v>
<v Speaker 2>academia and so I always do.</v>

449
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even take any breaks between my</v>

450
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:55.260
<v Speaker 2>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went through,</v>

451
00:20:55.261 --> 00:20:56.240
<v Speaker 2>it's through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through my phd,</v>

452
00:20:56.241 --> 00:20:59.710
<v Speaker 2>it's straight to professorship because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>never imagined doing anything else,</v>

453
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the work that I do,</v>

454
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.250
<v Speaker 2>if that's what we talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

455
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.153
<v Speaker 2>so what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do is I basically Mary </v>

456
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.250
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary psychology and biology to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the study of consumer behavior.</v>

457
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:13.503
<v Speaker 2>So the idea being that what makes us </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumed the way that we are is </v>

458
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.120
<v Speaker 2>ultimately rooted in some evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms.</v>

459
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.133
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that men are the ones who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely to succumb to the </v>

460
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 2>pornographic addiction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

461
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.030
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

462
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:25.863
<v Speaker 2>how do women's hormones throughout their</v>
<v Speaker 2>menstrual cycles affect their behaviors </v>

463
00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:30.334
<v Speaker 2>as consumers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I look at these biological </v>

464
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:34.330
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings specifically in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumer setting.</v>

465
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.433
<v Speaker 2>So do you think that most behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most human behaviors are linked back to </v>

466
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.610
<v Speaker 2>genetics more than anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you've talked about this.</v>

467
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

468
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the nature versus nurture </v>

469
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.094
<v Speaker 2>argument and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But would you say that's really where </v>

470
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.420
<v Speaker 2>the stuff we're made of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

471
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.760
<v Speaker 2>certainly there are biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>imperatives.</v>

472
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:54.100
<v Speaker 2>That's our part of our shared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

473
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.273
<v Speaker 2>human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's always an interaction </v>

474
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:59.140
<v Speaker 2>between our genes and our environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the.</v>

475
00:21:59.141 --> 00:21:59.974
<v Speaker 2>I always love to use a cake metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you take the ingredients in a </v>

476
00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:03.574
<v Speaker 2>cake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

477
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.360
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the baking soda and the flour,</v>

478
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:08.410
<v Speaker 2>the sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eggs,</v>

479
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 2>they're each separate ingredients.</v>

480
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Then you put them altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make a cake.</v>

481
00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:14.740
<v Speaker 2>If I were to tell you now point to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exit point of the sugar,</v>

482
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:15.723
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an inextricable mix and so much of </v>

483
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:21.640
<v Speaker 2>who we are as an inextricable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes of our nature and nurture.</v>

484
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:22.563
<v Speaker 2>The problem with most social scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been over the past hundred years is </v>

485
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:26.374
<v Speaker 2>that they have doggedly refuse to accept</v>
<v Speaker 2>that biology matters and so their </v>

486
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:32.280
<v Speaker 2>position has always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

487
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.123
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evolutionary theory is relevant to </v>

488
00:22:34.001 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 2>explain the behavior of the dog and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mosquito and the zebra,</v>

489
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.010
<v Speaker 2>but don't use their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apply it to human behavior.</v>

490
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.083
<v Speaker 2>We transcend our biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes us human is that we are </v>

491
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:44.350
<v Speaker 2>cultural animals and that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

492
00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you were just to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>people being gay,</v>

493
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.390
<v Speaker 2>would that be an argument against that </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well?</v>

494
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when they buy that logic,</v>

495
00:22:51.221 --> 00:22:53.380
<v Speaker 2>they would say you could override it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

496
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.230
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

497
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one example,</v>

498
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:57.010
<v Speaker 2>but there's a Zillion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

499
00:22:57.011 --> 00:22:57.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

500
00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.213
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It behooves one to understand how </v>

501
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:01.954
<v Speaker 2>serious academics could genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that biology doesn't carry much </v>

502
00:23:05.711 --> 00:23:08.020
<v Speaker 2>importance when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding human affairs,</v>

503
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.020
<v Speaker 2>but it really originally started from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good place.</v>

504
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.790
<v Speaker 2>A lot of miscreants use evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory for nefarious goals.</v>

505
00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler misused that.</v>

506
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.940
<v Speaker 2>A eugenesis misused as a social class </v>
<v Speaker 2>elitists in Britain and said,</v>

507
00:23:21.941 --> 00:23:22.774
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the upper classes are better than the </v>

508
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:26.240
<v Speaker 2>lower classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who cares if the little classes dot,</v>

509
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.093
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the Darwinian of course had </v>

510
00:23:27.811 --> 00:23:32.170
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with Darwinian theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because of all these cretins misuse,</v>

511
00:23:32.171 --> 00:23:34.180
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social sciences said,</v>

512
00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's create a new understanding of</v>

513
00:23:36.911 --> 00:23:37.744
<v Speaker 2>human nature where biology is no longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant and hopefully there won't be </v>

514
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:43.300
<v Speaker 2>these types of abuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's silly.</v>

515
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to route your science and logic</v>

516
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:46.570
<v Speaker 2>and reason.</v>

517
00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my whole a direct message at the top </v>

518
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:53.180
<v Speaker 2>of the show is talking about academia </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sort of the ideas that are,</v>

519
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.630
<v Speaker 2>that are working in colleges and mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are not working and the free speech</v>

520
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:59.390
<v Speaker 2>problems we're having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were hugely here in America,</v>

521
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:00.224
<v Speaker 2>but I know it's happening in Canada too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's happening all across Europe </v>

522
00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:04.080
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

523
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.993
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right in the thick of that </v>

524
00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:07.770
<v Speaker 2>because you are outspoken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

525
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.953
<v Speaker 2>why we connected in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this guy on twitter and I was </v>

526
00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:11.151
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

527
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 2>this guy gets it and he's not afraid to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say it.</v>

528
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:14.340
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

529
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think the general atmosphere</v>

530
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or talk about for your experience,</v>

531
00:24:18.771 --> 00:24:22.270
<v Speaker 2>what's the general?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might have seen it.</v>

532
00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.193
<v Speaker 2>I recently delivered a lecture on </v>
<v Speaker 2>political correctness and the thought </v>

533
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:29.150
<v Speaker 2>police and I gave many of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>examples,</v>

534
00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:31.370
<v Speaker 2>which if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they weren't true,</v>

535
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.470
<v Speaker 2>you would think it's straight out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>onion.</v>

536
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.303
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really just an impossible to </v>

537
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:39.800
<v Speaker 2>imagine that the fulcrum has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has swung so much towards lunacy.</v>

538
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to fight it.</v>

539
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality is that most academics,</v>

540
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to keep repeating this point,</v>

541
00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:49.240
<v Speaker 2>but are afraid of their shadows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're careerists,</v>

542
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.453
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that the general </v>

543
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.660
<v Speaker 2>environment is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to coddle the,</v>

544
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.180
<v Speaker 2>the students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to infantilize them.</v>

545
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Don't you dare say something that might </v>
<v Speaker 2>offend them,</v>

546
00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:00.303
<v Speaker 2>then they perpetuate the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if enough people stand up </v>

547
00:25:03.381 --> 00:25:04.520
<v Speaker 2>courageously and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

548
00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:05.820
<v Speaker 2>this is not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As my five.</v>

549
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 2>I've had this discussion recently here </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some college students,</v>

550
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:11.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

551
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.490
<v Speaker 2>I explained to them that it's not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your benefit,</v>

552
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have professors be terrified to speak</v>

553
00:25:17.901 --> 00:25:18.740
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

554
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:19.603
<v Speaker 2>there's a great article that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember the name of the professor who </v>

555
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:22.220
<v Speaker 2>wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically said,</v>

556
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my students terrify me.</v>

557
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.600
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

558
00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:28.520
<v Speaker 2>if you're a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to hear that right?</v>

559
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:30.740
<v Speaker 2>You want professors will challenge you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>

560
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.660
<v Speaker 2>who gets you to move from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>

561
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.650
<v Speaker 2>If we are afraid to utter a one syllable</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might somehow,</v>

562
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessitate you going into a safe space,</v>

563
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.260
<v Speaker 2>it shatters the possibility for </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue.</v>

564
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say that to students,</v>

565
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to guess that on an individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

566
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:47.774
<v Speaker 2>if you're sitting across from them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably do get that they probably </v>

567
00:25:50.951 --> 00:25:51.784
<v Speaker 2>don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that when you get them in a group </v>

568
00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:56.860
<v Speaker 2>and the group think star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's where it becomes dangerous.</v>

569
00:25:56.861 --> 00:25:57.694
<v Speaker 2>So mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do you combat that patiently by </v>

570
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:01.454
<v Speaker 2>demonstrating through evidence that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is ultimately suboptimal and it will </v>

571
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.950
<v Speaker 2>only hurt your growth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

572
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.843
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people learn by engaging the diversity </v>

573
00:26:10.311 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 2>of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

574
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.140
<v Speaker 2>that's what learning is about.</v>

575
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.333
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I explained to them that I'm very </v>

576
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:17.390
<v Speaker 2>open to somebody coming to see me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

577
00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:20.270
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced this in this trauma and</v>

578
00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 2>therefore I need this particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

579
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquiescence and fine.</v>

580
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:26.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an,</v>

581
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:28.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm an empathetic person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that into account.</v>

582
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.020
<v Speaker 2>But to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

583
00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:30.854
<v Speaker 2>a trigger warning that is sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 2>vague that it covers every possible </v>

584
00:26:35.721 --> 00:26:38.480
<v Speaker 2>thing that might trigger somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good idea.</v>

585
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.433
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's dig into the trigger warning </v>

586
00:26:40.821 --> 00:26:41.654
<v Speaker 2>thing a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there there would be trigger </v>

587
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 2>warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

588
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 2>if you were teaching a course and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were going to discuss rape,</v>

589
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:47.783
<v Speaker 2>they would a certain amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that like these ideas would want </v>

590
00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:51.204
<v Speaker 2>you to issue a trigger warning so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in case someone that was in the class </v>

591
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:55.494
<v Speaker 2>had been raped or their mother had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>raped or their sister had been raped or </v>

592
00:26:57.881 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

593
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 2>they would receive notice before </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing it.</v>

594
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.190
<v Speaker 2>I know that doesn't sound terrible in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of itself,</v>

595
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the pervasiveness of it,</v>

596
00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:08.784
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way that it then sort of </v>

597
00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 2>shelters you from really dealing with as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

598
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:14.703
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted to a few examples such as </v>

599
00:27:17.251 --> 00:27:19.500
<v Speaker 2>rate becomes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everything.</v>

600
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.363
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

601
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took,</v>

602
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:22.643
<v Speaker 2>I took it upon me to actually generates </v>
<v Speaker 2>a list of topics that have been </v>

603
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.830
<v Speaker 2>suggested as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Topics that would be worthy of a trigger</v>

604
00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:33.480
<v Speaker 2>warning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually I covered that in my,</v>

605
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:34.343
<v Speaker 2>in my lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and basically those topics that I </v>

606
00:27:36.841 --> 00:27:37.674
<v Speaker 2>generated would pretty much cover </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that anybody could ever talk </v>

607
00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:43.600
<v Speaker 2>about soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be then,</v>

608
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

609
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

610
00:27:46.051 --> 00:27:46.990
<v Speaker 2>And yet here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

611
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.833
<v Speaker 2>where do you think this started?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the part that I find </v>

612
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:52.190
<v Speaker 2>really interesting and I did discuss it </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit with Tarek.</v>

613
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did this idea that you have to be </v>

614
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:59.490
<v Speaker 2>protected come from and how did it </v>
<v Speaker 2>proliferate so quickly?</v>

615
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it comes from different sources,</v>

616
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 2>but political correctness is really the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

617
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.253
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impetus of all of these subsequent </v>

618
00:28:08.131 --> 00:28:08.964
<v Speaker 2>movements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

619
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.360
<v Speaker 2>The idea that there are certain things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should not say.</v>

620
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.670
<v Speaker 2>And then we take this idea and then we </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

621
00:28:14.671 --> 00:28:15.504
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are certain things that you </v>

622
00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:16.494
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't say it because it makes people</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel uncomfortable or it hurts them or </v>

623
00:28:18.811 --> 00:28:19.644
<v Speaker 2>triggers a past trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it becomes the way that I've </v>

624
00:28:22.021 --> 00:28:22.854
<v Speaker 2>described that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a speculum hypothesis right </v>

625
00:28:25.051 --> 00:28:25.884
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly worth testing is a </v>

626
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:30.120
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon known as Munchhausen's </v>
<v Speaker 2>syndrome.</v>

627
00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically says,</v>

628
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

629
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.980
<v Speaker 2>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>typically it's a woman who suffered from</v>

630
00:28:34.981 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 2>this disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

631
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 2>we'll try to feign an illness to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>garner sympathy.</v>

632
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.903
<v Speaker 2>Then there's Bush Munchausen Syndrome by</v>
<v Speaker 2>proxy where you harm your child or your </v>

633
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:50.040
<v Speaker 2>pet or your elderly parents to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>then garner sympathy.</v>

634
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.970
<v Speaker 2>But I think this type of crying for safe</v>
<v Speaker 2>space is sort of this growth tests,</v>

635
00:28:54.971 --> 00:28:57.540
<v Speaker 2>collective Munchhausen Syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

636
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Where people get attention by constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming victim hood.</v>

637
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.960
<v Speaker 2>And so it becomes a very alluring way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate through the world.</v>

638
00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I always get attention by saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm offended,</v>

639
00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:10.254
<v Speaker 2>I'm hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

640
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I escaped execution.</v>

641
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I could still watch a military movie I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want from now on,</v>

642
00:29:16.531 --> 00:29:20.220
<v Speaker 2>whenever I walk around in any city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shut down all movie theaters,</v>

643
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 2>that's military because I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be executed in Lebanon to do it.</v>

644
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.731
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

645
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.010
<v Speaker 2>it's really nuts when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

646
00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.720
<v Speaker 2>especially when you lay out like a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphor like that.</v>

647
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:34.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is because we could all </v>
<v Speaker 2>do this and that's why every,</v>

648
00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:34.830
<v Speaker 2>what do they call it?</v>

649
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like the afflicted Olympics or</v>

650
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.780
<v Speaker 2>the oppression and the oppression </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics.</v>

651
00:29:39.781 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will never stop.</v>

652
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see this now as,</v>

653
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:48.700
<v Speaker 2>as a disease that's running rampant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I talk about it so much.</v>

654
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:49.743
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine that this will continue </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I already see a lot of academics </v>

655
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.100
<v Speaker 2>write to me privately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

656
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 2>saying to me they don't yet have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>courage to come on board publicly,</v>

657
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.090
<v Speaker 2>but they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

658
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:03.820
<v Speaker 2>thank you for speaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for being a voice of reason.</v>

659
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:07.390
<v Speaker 2>This has empowered me to try to be a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>more open.</v>

660
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think all it takes is for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>flicker to start.</v>

661
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.870
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually I think the tide </v>
<v Speaker 2>will shift back.</v>

662
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

663
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Well that's nice to hear that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>privately do that.</v>

664
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 2>But do you get pushback from professors </v>
<v Speaker 2>that think a gads pushing this too much?</v>

665
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it to my face because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

666
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm a formidable guy to go against other</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>

667
00:30:25.131 --> 00:30:28.090
<v Speaker 2>You better come with all your guns if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do this stuff with me.</v>

668
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So usually it doesn't happen directly,</v>

669
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:31.743
<v Speaker 2>but I will hear from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from sources that such and such person </v>

670
00:30:35.351 --> 00:30:37.120
<v Speaker 2>is upset that I'm taking these </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>

671
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:39.670
<v Speaker 2>So I know that there are groups that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset with me,</v>

672
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.290
<v Speaker 2>but they don't necessarily come to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>face and say.</v>

673
00:30:42.291 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a great argument for tenure,</v>

674
00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:47.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you have tenure rights.</v>

675
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since 1990 $9.</v>

676
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Ninety nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you got tenure,</v>

677
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 2>did that change at that moment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they,</v>

678
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.370
<v Speaker 2>what did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hand your paper.</v>

679
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.260
<v Speaker 2>How does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

680
00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kneel down and.</v>

681
00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a committee.</v>

682
00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:01.450
<v Speaker 2>It goes through several layers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then finally use,</v>

683
00:31:01.451 --> 00:31:03.100
<v Speaker 2>receive a letter saying that you've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>granted tenure.</v>

684
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

685
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.473
<v Speaker 2>the process of applying for it as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically give your whole dose here to </v>

686
00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:10.720
<v Speaker 2>demonstrate that you're worthy of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>honor.</v>

687
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.713
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the protections you actually </v>

688
00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:14.160
<v Speaker 2>get for tenure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

689
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.170
<v Speaker 2>they just can't fire you just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there must be some Grazia.</v>

690
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.080
<v Speaker 2>What if they run out of money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the university closes?</v>

691
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Only if your department would have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>closed for financial reasons,</v>

692
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.730
<v Speaker 2>then that would be ground for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>closing the department.</v>

693
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.360
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you a tenured wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect you,</v>

694
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.540
<v Speaker 2>but the purpose of tenure is really to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that,</v>

695
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:32.743
<v Speaker 2>let's suppose I'm doing work on </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary psychology and the Dean as </v>

696
00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 2>a young Earth creationists who thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that evolution is a Zionist hoax.</v>

697
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

698
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he or she can't come to me and say,</v>

699
00:31:42.521 --> 00:31:43.354
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better stop this evolution stuff </v>

700
00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.970
<v Speaker 2>because it offends me and it makes our </v>
<v Speaker 2>university look bad and I'll fire you.</v>

701
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tenure is a means by which you ensure</v>

702
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:56.761
<v Speaker 2>that a good ideas are able to be pursued</v>
<v Speaker 2>because oftentimes most of the important</v>

703
00:31:57.281 --> 00:31:58.114
<v Speaker 2>ideas or dangerous ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're ideas that go against the </v>

704
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:01.923
<v Speaker 2>orthodoxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're ideas that are considered </v>

705
00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:04.540
<v Speaker 2>critical at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

706
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Think of Galileo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of socrates,</v>

707
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:08.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

708
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.320
<v Speaker 2>the idea oftentimes and in political </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse,</v>

709
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.700
<v Speaker 2>politicians will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

710
00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:14.890
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get rid of tenure because </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these facts,</v>

711
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:16.570
<v Speaker 2>professors sit around doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

712
00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.573
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically them saying that </v>

713
00:32:18.581 --> 00:32:22.840
<v Speaker 2>they're idiots because it's admitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing their job.</v>

714
00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Tenure is there to make sure that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could pinch pursued dangerous ideas.</v>

715
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Now regarding my specific context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when I didn't have tenure,</v>

716
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:34.803
<v Speaker 2>I was outspoken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not necessarily about trigger </v>

717
00:32:36.401 --> 00:32:37.720
<v Speaker 2>warnings because there wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

718
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 2>But in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never modulator that my behavior maybe</v>

719
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:42.104
<v Speaker 2>to a fault.</v>

720
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm not enough of a careerist I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

721
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

722
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.633
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pursuit of truth for me is greater </v>

723
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 2>than any careerist considerations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

724
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.363
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that and I know that to be true </v>

725
00:32:53.961 --> 00:32:54.794
<v Speaker 2>from you and that's why your channel has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been picking up steam and while you're </v>

726
00:32:57.621 --> 00:33:00.860
<v Speaker 2>talking to so many great people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think part of it really is because</v>

727
00:33:00.861 --> 00:33:02.600
<v Speaker 2>of exactly what you wrote about in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

728
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:03.703
<v Speaker 2>that you're approaching the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>topics that we're talking about and the </v>

729
00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:09.470
<v Speaker 2>religious topics from a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

730
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I sense that that really is the bedrock </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what you do as a scientist.</v>

731
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:17.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're trying to quantify </v>
<v Speaker 2>and qualify all of this stuff.</v>

732
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:18.703
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I saw your interview with Bill </v>

733
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Warner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is also a scientist and a,</v>

734
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 2>an uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

735
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 2>he studied all of the religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

736
00:33:25.221 --> 00:33:26.054
<v Speaker 2>He said he studied with Moms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he studied the Qur'an and he studied </v>

737
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 2>with rabbis and Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Old Testament,</v>

738
00:33:31.251 --> 00:33:31.760
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

739
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.593
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought he said something very </v>

740
00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:37.250
<v Speaker 2>similar that as he's looking at these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things as a scientist,</v>

741
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.650
<v Speaker 2>not as a sociologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

742
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.150
<v Speaker 2>And do you think that's really the </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthiest way to listen?</v>

743
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.140
<v Speaker 2>And actually that's one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>

744
00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:45.974
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I receive negative comments </v>

745
00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 2>from people and hate mail and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But given the types of positions I take,</v>

746
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:52.544
<v Speaker 2>they're actually quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite few of them precisely because I </v>

747
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:56.870
<v Speaker 2>approach it in the manner that I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

748
00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:57.853
<v Speaker 2>So whenever I take a position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make sure that it is documented as it </v>

749
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 2>would be if I were submitting a paper to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a scientific journal.</v>

750
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>

751
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.813
<v Speaker 2>my evidentiary threshold is set so high </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it becomes difficult to break it </v>

752
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:16.880
<v Speaker 2>down and therefore people can accuse me </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hate speech and this and that because</v>

753
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:19.040
<v Speaker 2>everything is backed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the case of Bill Warner,</v>

754
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:19.874
<v Speaker 2>for the viewers who may not know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he basically applied the tools of </v>

755
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:23.504
<v Speaker 2>content analysis to then quantify the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of hate that is found in </v>

756
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:29.684
<v Speaker 2>different different religious texts so </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to have a vacuous </v>

757
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.670
<v Speaker 2>discussion about whether Islam is </v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful or not,</v>

758
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:39.470
<v Speaker 2>whether the Old Testament is peaceful or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

759
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.543
<v Speaker 2>I can actually use the tools of science </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this case called a content analysis </v>

760
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:47.570
<v Speaker 2>to quantify how much hate there is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this book.</v>

761
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that becomes unassailable well.</v>

762
00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:51.723
<v Speaker 2>So with the assailable part b though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what's in the book is only only </v>

763
00:34:54.861 --> 00:34:57.470
<v Speaker 2>matters depending on the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that act on it.</v>

764
00:34:57.471 --> 00:34:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not,</v>

765
00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.190
<v Speaker 2>that's not unassailable in its in its </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific method,</v>

766
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.250
<v Speaker 2>but that's what the real issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

767
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.093
<v Speaker 2>The real issue is not what's in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these books as much as how many people </v>

768
00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:08.780
<v Speaker 2>are acting on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that sounded almost Reza Aslan,</v>

769
00:35:08.781 --> 00:35:13.781
<v Speaker 2>which to me didn't get me out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because residence I fully.</v>

770
00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:14.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

771
00:35:14.181 --> 00:35:16.010
<v Speaker 2>we know these books are all nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

772
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Because they're all filled by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>written by men thousands of years ago,</v>

773
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really what's in them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as how people act on them.</v>

774
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Reza Aslan basically used the,</v>

775
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.053
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst thing anyone's ever said to </v>

776
00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:27.290
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

777
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:31.550
<v Speaker 2>my deep apologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reza Aslan basically use the,</v>

778
00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:36.320
<v Speaker 2>a BS argument from postmodernism to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put your meaning exactly.</v>

779
00:35:36.321 --> 00:35:38.550
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are we to judge whether kill,</v>

780
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:40.030
<v Speaker 2>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill means that kill,</v>

781
00:35:40.031 --> 00:35:40.864
<v Speaker 2>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill could mean a stroke with kindness </v>

782
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:43.734
<v Speaker 2>and correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

783
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:44.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

784
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

785
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:50.400
<v Speaker 2>A language has accepted beaning and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of postmodern gymnastics is going</v>

786
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:53.880
<v Speaker 2>to alter that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

787
00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:54.714
<v Speaker 2>So I guess what I think what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying is that if you looked at the </v>

788
00:35:57.541 --> 00:35:58.374
<v Speaker 2>three books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think by most accounts that the </v>

789
00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:02.970
<v Speaker 2>old testament's probably the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent of them,</v>

790
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.300
<v Speaker 2>but no one would really acting on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence of that.</v>

791
00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 2>So that doesn't discount that it says </v>
<v Speaker 2>some horrible stuff,</v>

792
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 2>but if nobody's acting on it then it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of irrelevant.</v>

793
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.420
<v Speaker 2>So I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that's not how postmodern,</v>

794
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.373
<v Speaker 2>because I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that exact quote from him and it </v>

795
00:36:17.431 --> 00:36:18.264
<v Speaker 2>sounds like pure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we could get into the theological </v>

796
00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

797
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:21.931
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

798
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:22.764
<v Speaker 2>if in the Old Testament says killed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>alumni alumna kites a while they don't </v>

799
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:28.314
<v Speaker 2>exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if I was desperate to act on </v>

800
00:36:30.781 --> 00:36:32.760
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edx I wouldn't be able to.</v>

801
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.200
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a,</v>

802
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.063
<v Speaker 2>another religious book has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the following tenant killed the </v>

803
00:36:38.041 --> 00:36:41.970
<v Speaker 2>nonbelievers wherever you find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is actionable today.</v>

804
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

805
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.580
<v Speaker 2>so no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument that.</v>

806
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends who acts on it.</v>

807
00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:46.974
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very plus we don't have many </v>

808
00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:51.790
<v Speaker 2>people today that act on Deuteronomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that,</v>

809
00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.480
<v Speaker 2>that was my point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it depends on who's acting on it,</v>

810
00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:57.380
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't change the specifics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

811
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 2>That are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are in the tech.</v>

812
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find that as an academic and as a</v>

813
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:03.143
<v Speaker 2>social scientist and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's exhausting talking about </v>

814
00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:09.120
<v Speaker 2>religion because you don't believe in it</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

815
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:10.043
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're trying to add something </v>

816
00:37:11.461 --> 00:37:12.660
<v Speaker 2>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I feel.</v>

817
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:13.643
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly trying to rationalize </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that cannot be rationalized </v>

818
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:21.030
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually also in your discussion with</v>

819
00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:21.864
<v Speaker 2>Bill Warner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said one of the interesting things </v>

820
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:26.640
<v Speaker 2>about the current is you can almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationalize anything because you can say</v>

821
00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:28.860
<v Speaker 2>something's really great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

822
00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.520
<v Speaker 2>So can you explain to a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

823
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.510
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is so people don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

824
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.843
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Koran has what's called abrogated </v>

825
00:37:36.361 --> 00:37:37.460
<v Speaker 2>versus so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

826
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.290
<v Speaker 2>God might have decided through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelations to say,</v>

827
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no compulsion in religion.</v>

828
00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.900
<v Speaker 2>And then later God is allowed to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>his mind and say,</v>

829
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:47.010
<v Speaker 2>killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

830
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 2>don't be so tolerant.</v>

831
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

832
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could it be that a and not a can </v>

833
00:37:51.211 --> 00:37:52.410
<v Speaker 2>coexist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

834
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.273
<v Speaker 2>through dual logic that can be allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the way you do that as through </v>

835
00:37:55.321 --> 00:37:57.810
<v Speaker 2>abrogation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically means that when you have</v>

836
00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.673
<v Speaker 2>two techs that contradict one another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the later texts texts supersedes the </v>

837
00:38:03.631 --> 00:38:04.464
<v Speaker 2>previous one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people typically quote the </v>

838
00:38:06.211 --> 00:38:09.270
<v Speaker 2>gentle passages from the Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the Meccan period,</v>

839
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.790
<v Speaker 2>those passages have actually been </v>
<v Speaker 2>abrogated.</v>

840
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.660
<v Speaker 2>They've been made null and void.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now in some cases,</v>

841
00:38:15.661 --> 00:38:16.494
<v Speaker 2>the people who who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who quote those passages know this and </v>

842
00:38:19.951 --> 00:38:20.784
<v Speaker 2>they are actually being duplicitous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other cases they're unaware of this </v>

843
00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:24.570
<v Speaker 2>aggregation mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

844
00:38:24.571 --> 00:38:27.390
<v Speaker 2>so let's just talk about Reza for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute since you brought him up.</v>

845
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.513
<v Speaker 2>And he and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's become such a player in </v>

846
00:38:30.001 --> 00:38:33.510
<v Speaker 2>this space and CNNS even giving him a </v>
<v Speaker 2>show all about belief,</v>

847
00:38:33.511 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 2>which sounds just horrific.</v>

848
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he plays those games,</v>

849
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

850
00:38:39.311 --> 00:38:40.144
<v Speaker 2>You know that he knows this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows about what you just described </v>

851
00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.450
<v Speaker 2>and yet he's doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do we do with these players?</v>

852
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:47.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we do with?</v>

853
00:38:47.431 --> 00:38:49.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a great question because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

854
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:50.870
<v Speaker 2>What has endgame is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

855
00:38:50.871 --> 00:38:51.704
<v Speaker 2>as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it that he's engaging in self deception </v>

856
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.650
<v Speaker 2>as we know humans are very adept at </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

857
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:57.663
<v Speaker 2>There's actually some very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary arguments for why people </v>

858
00:38:59.321 --> 00:39:01.270
<v Speaker 2>engage in self deception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want me to take off?</v>

859
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.463
<v Speaker 2>Let's go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

860
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:03.363
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the argument for the evolution of </v>

861
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:07.690
<v Speaker 2>self deception is that when you and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>are chatting a,</v>

862
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.280
<v Speaker 2>we're engaging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like an Imac,</v>

863
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:12.610
<v Speaker 2>a valiant battle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to get you to do what I want,</v>

864
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.650
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want you to know that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this right.</v>

865
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.640
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm lying to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are typically markers and made that</v>

866
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:21.850
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to pick up to see if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>being duplicitous or not.</v>

867
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.073
<v Speaker 2>The way that I shut off those markers as</v>
<v Speaker 2>by first convincing myself that I'm not </v>

868
00:39:27.101 --> 00:39:27.970
<v Speaker 2>lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

869
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:33.180
<v Speaker 2>by engaging in self deception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shut off the mechanisms that you might</v>

870
00:39:33.281 --> 00:39:35.950
<v Speaker 2>otherwise read in me that I'm lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

871
00:39:35.951 --> 00:39:36.784
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is that a fully conscious decision </v>

872
00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:39.064
<v Speaker 2>on the part of the person that's doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it as an evolutionary mechanism that's </v>

873
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:44.440
<v Speaker 2>been built into us now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

874
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

875
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.053
<v Speaker 2>signed on Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a classic episode where George </v>

876
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Costanza says to Jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might get the quote wrong.</v>

877
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Remember Jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not alive if you believe it.</v>

878
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

879
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 2>actually talked about this in one of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier books.</v>

880
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

881
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 2>that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

882
00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.073
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in [inaudible] case whether he truly </v>

883
00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:04.330
<v Speaker 2>believes the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the just the endless tsunami of nonsense</v>

884
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:08.710
<v Speaker 2>that he produces or whether it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>duplicitous attempt.</v>

885
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:09.130
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

886
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.290
<v Speaker 2>this is the way by which I've become </v>
<v Speaker 2>very famous.</v>

887
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:12.124
<v Speaker 2>This is the way by which I get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention because I'm sort of the Brown </v>

888
00:40:14.441 --> 00:40:17.770
<v Speaker 2>guy from Iran who could appear moderate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>

889
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.790
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to stick to that niche </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's got me a lot of fame.</v>

890
00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:25.150
<v Speaker 2>So I can't tell which of these two </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities he's under.</v>

891
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.013
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting because when I hear </v>

892
00:40:26.771 --> 00:40:27.604
<v Speaker 2>you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it clearly comes from a place where </v>

893
00:40:29.201 --> 00:40:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to give him the benefit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doubt,</v>

894
00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:33.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just went out of your way to not say</v>

895
00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 2>this guy is a duplicitous liar or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

896
00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.890
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris says how intentions matter.</v>

897
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're trying to say,</v>

898
00:40:40.421 --> 00:40:45.421
<v Speaker 2>well maybe his intentions are good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be a reason to fiddle with</v>

899
00:40:45.971 --> 00:40:49.870
<v Speaker 2>some of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent that all the people that,</v>

900
00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.003
<v Speaker 2>that we argue with all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would not give us any of those </v>

901
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.233
<v Speaker 2>passes and that to me shows you where </v>
<v Speaker 2>this battle really is happening right </v>

902
00:40:59.720 --> 00:40:59.900
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

903
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.690
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of a,</v>

904
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.220
<v Speaker 2>an immediate reflex to label anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's in our space,</v>

905
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Nazi and Hitler and Himmler,</v>

906
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:09.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

907
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

908
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been fortunate.</v>

909
00:41:11.951 --> 00:41:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock on wood,</v>

910
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had too much of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe because I am quite measured in how</v>

911
00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I speak and maybe because I come from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that background,</v>

912
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.420
<v Speaker 2>it gives me a layer of protection which </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe Sam can't have.</v>

913
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been fortunate in that sense.</v>

914
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to what my question that started this</v>

915
00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:32.584
<v Speaker 2>whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using scientific method to discuss </v>

916
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.670
<v Speaker 2>texts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not this text.</v>

917
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:38.803
<v Speaker 2>What religious texts that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily based in rationality or in </v>

918
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:44.540
<v Speaker 2>secular values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you find it exhausting?</v>

919
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having,</v>

920
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:46.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like are,</v>

921
00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:47.354
<v Speaker 2>do you find yourself spending a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time deciphering things that we </v>

922
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:52.610
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be worried about anymore?</v>

923
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.850
<v Speaker 2>We don't worry about what scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought 3000 years ago.</v>

924
00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:58.490
<v Speaker 2>So why are we worried about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious people thought?</v>

925
00:41:58.491 --> 00:41:59.960
<v Speaker 2>$3,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's extraordinary,</v>

926
00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if,</v>

927
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.120
<v Speaker 2>if you take a belief that someone holds </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't cloak it under the robe of</v>

928
00:42:06.771 --> 00:42:10.770
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then this would be tantamount to the guy</v>

929
00:42:10.771 --> 00:42:13.550
<v Speaker 2>being schizophrenia and let's commit </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to a mental hospital.</v>

930
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.413
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we can give a good example of that </v>

931
00:42:16.101 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 2>because I think that's a really great </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

932
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

933
00:42:18.921 --> 00:42:19.754
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

934
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 2>this profit has gone on a winged horse </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

935
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I say that,</v>

936
00:42:25.911 --> 00:42:26.270
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

937
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

938
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.030
<v Speaker 2>Dave Ruben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>

939
00:42:29.031 --> 00:42:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I saw him on a winged horse going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

940
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.290
<v Speaker 2>then we're good mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I would call a,</v>

941
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:40.580
<v Speaker 2>my clinical psychologists or </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrists,</v>

942
00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 2>friends and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

943
00:42:41.721 --> 00:42:44.030
<v Speaker 2>let's try to commit Dave Rubin to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric hospital.</v>

944
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.880
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I say the exact same thing,</v>

945
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.820
<v Speaker 2>but it is cloaked under a religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>

946
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:52.280
<v Speaker 2>don't you dare criticize that narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

947
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.203
<v Speaker 2>So the exact same statement is either a </v>
<v Speaker 2>form of lunacy or perfectly acceptable </v>

948
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.610
<v Speaker 2>religion depending on whether it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected by religion.</v>

949
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's grotesque,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

950
00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is your belief in whatever narrative</v>

951
00:43:06.321 --> 00:43:09.680
<v Speaker 2>you choose to believe somehow sacrosanct</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can't touch it.</v>

952
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when it comes to religion and </v>

953
00:43:11.541 --> 00:43:12.374
<v Speaker 2>obviously we've spent a lot of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this and I've had mostly </v>

954
00:43:14.601 --> 00:43:15.434
<v Speaker 2>people that are anti religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just last week I had an ultra </v>

955
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.290
<v Speaker 2>orthodox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultra Orthodox,</v>

956
00:43:18.291 --> 00:43:19.870
<v Speaker 2>but Orthodox Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben,</v>

957
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.713
<v Speaker 2>she mentioned thought made some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>cogent arguments separating religion </v>

958
00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:27.020
<v Speaker 2>from politics even though I didn't agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him on a lot of it,</v>

959
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:29.060
<v Speaker 2>but I thought he did an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

960
00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:32.030
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't trying to govern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sense from a place of religion,</v>

961
00:43:32.031 --> 00:43:32.864
<v Speaker 2>which I could at least respect that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you make of the general </v>

962
00:43:36.201 --> 00:43:37.210
<v Speaker 2>feeling that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

963
00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.053
<v Speaker 2>you watch the superbowl in the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>last superbowl and they thank God these </v>

964
00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:41.984
<v Speaker 2>are people who spend their entire lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>training to become machines of </v>

965
00:43:47.721 --> 00:43:52.550
<v Speaker 2>athleticism and the team that lost also </v>
<v Speaker 2>but also pray to the same guy,</v>

966
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:56.060
<v Speaker 2>but somehow God really was for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cardinals.</v>

967
00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:00.300
<v Speaker 2>So he hates the trailblazers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm mixing sports.</v>

968
00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.850
<v Speaker 2>You make sport that I really got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do not support support of that,</v>

969
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:05.340
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

970
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think of A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

971
00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:08.150
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

972
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 2>but to me that what that shows is not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief in God per se,</v>

973
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:15.530
<v Speaker 2>as much as it shows almost a </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic disorder,</v>

974
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:16.603
<v Speaker 2>the Lord of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean if only people would have a </v>

975
00:44:19.131 --> 00:44:24.131
<v Speaker 2>sense of the vastness of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uniquely cares about a point guard who's</v>

976
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.760
<v Speaker 2>about to make a three point closing shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if he makes it.</v>

977
00:44:28.761 --> 00:44:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh Lord Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you Jesus.</v>

978
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Really be invested in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

979
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:35.880
<v Speaker 2>career stats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

980
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.620
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can also take examples.</v>

981
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 2>It would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

982
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.983
<v Speaker 2>if you jerked off or something and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt guilty after because God was </v>

983
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:46.260
<v Speaker 2>watching you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's watching you do that.</v>

984
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.440
<v Speaker 2>He's watching basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better things to do.</v>

985
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.363
<v Speaker 2>I mean really if without even more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a certain mocking tone </v>

986
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but without even mocking it,</v>

987
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:56.280
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really believed in this,</v>

988
00:44:56.281 --> 00:45:00.240
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you believe that God would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something else?</v>

989
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Creating another universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

990
00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it seems so silly.</v>

991
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:08.520
<v Speaker 2>He's quite pedantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll give you.</v>

992
00:45:08.521 --> 00:45:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I did A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

993
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:11.410
<v Speaker 2>it's in this book where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

994
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played this following a mental game.</v>

995
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 2>Suppose you had a Martian who came to </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth and he's shopping for the one true</v>

996
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:21.810
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he asks a bunch of questions.</v>

997
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Am I allowed to wear leather shoes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I have a tattoo?</v>

998
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Am I allowed to be to have homosexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>relations?</v>

999
00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:29.214
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think from the most mundane to the </v>

1000
00:45:30.631 --> 00:45:31.464
<v Speaker 2>most a metaphysical questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I demonstrated that for every possible </v>

1001
00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:36.354
<v Speaker 2>question that you can generate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could identify two religions that </v>

1002
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.560
<v Speaker 2>prescribe the exact opposite thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that same question.</v>

1003
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:44.783
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that doesn't serve as a devastating </v>

1004
00:45:46.531 --> 00:45:48.830
<v Speaker 2>blow to the whole scam of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing was.</v>

1005
00:45:48.831 --> 00:45:49.664
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1006
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Let's put it another way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are 10,000</v>

1007
00:45:51.781 --> 00:45:54.130
<v Speaker 2>documented religions in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1008
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I bet you 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>now here.</v>

1009
00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.323
<v Speaker 2>What I mean is different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>nominations of Christianity with </v>

1010
00:45:58.711 --> 00:45:59.790
<v Speaker 2>countless different religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1011
00:45:59.791 --> 00:46:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are 10,000</v>

1012
00:46:01.561 --> 00:46:02.394
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that they typically have </v>

1013
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:06.810
<v Speaker 2>in common is that each of them says that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the true religion.</v>

1014
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.930
<v Speaker 2>The other 9,999</v>
<v Speaker 2>are false.</v>

1015
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Credible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds a bit fishy to me.</v>

1016
00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:15.143
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also that they are all designed </v>

1017
00:46:16.261 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that when I'm,</v>

1018
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.040
<v Speaker 2>when we're debating a lot of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1019
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:20.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with we've gotten almost 40 </v>

1020
00:46:21.991 --> 00:46:22.824
<v Speaker 2>minutes and haven't said regressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm finally going to say the word </v>

1021
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:25.523
<v Speaker 2>progressive and regressive left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they always want everything to be </v>

1022
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:31.920
<v Speaker 2>equally as bad except some religions </v>
<v Speaker 2>want people to convert into them.</v>

1023
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Some don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1024
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:36.210
<v Speaker 2>That would show that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that it's necessarily better,</v>

1025
00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:39.390
<v Speaker 2>but it would show that certain people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to spread their ideas as much</v>

1026
00:46:39.391 --> 00:46:42.020
<v Speaker 2>as other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a need on the left to go.</v>

1027
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Everything's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you do that,</v>

1028
00:46:44.461 --> 00:46:45.780
<v Speaker 2>you're actually saying nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1029
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I've actually used that same argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the end,</v>

1030
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.390
<v Speaker 2>under the context of an academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting.</v>

1031
00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:53.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a concept known as a meme.</v>

1032
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1033
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.640
<v Speaker 2>So this is from Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1034
00:46:56.641 --> 00:46:57.474
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins argues that religion is </v>

1035
00:46:58.981 --> 00:46:59.814
<v Speaker 2>a Mima plex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a collection of memes and memes </v>

1036
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:02.543
<v Speaker 2>spread very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how viruses spread or how genes </v>

1037
00:47:05.101 --> 00:47:08.520
<v Speaker 2>propagate and populations well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or or how meme spread on twitter.</v>

1038
00:47:08.521 --> 00:47:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1039
00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:15.360
<v Speaker 2>So to go to your point about religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some religions that the content of their</v>

1040
00:47:16.591 --> 00:47:19.740
<v Speaker 2>memes are inherently infectious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1041
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:22.980
<v Speaker 2>the transmissibility of that religion is</v>
<v Speaker 2>much greater.</v>

1042
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.813
<v Speaker 2>So in Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you you don't proselytize </v>

1043
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:28.800
<v Speaker 2>is precisely the reason why they are 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14,</v>

1044
00:47:28.801 --> 00:47:30.490
<v Speaker 2>15 million Jews depending on how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>count,</v>

1045
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the whole entire universe world,</v>

1046
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:33.843
<v Speaker 2>they are $50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million Jews on the other hand and a </v>

1047
00:47:35.241 --> 00:47:36.074
<v Speaker 2>religion where you're allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>proselytize and there are other things </v>

1048
00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:40.540
<v Speaker 2>that you can do all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1049
00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:42.280
<v Speaker 2>it takes very little to get into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

1050
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.990
<v Speaker 2>In Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1051
00:47:43.991 --> 00:47:44.824
<v Speaker 2>right in Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you truly wish to convert according </v>

1052
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:47.524
<v Speaker 2>to the strict tenants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just sort of say one sentence </v>

1053
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:54.270
<v Speaker 2>and we'll welcome to the right of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish clan,</v>

1054
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.113
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually have to go through a very </v>

1055
00:47:56.291 --> 00:47:57.124
<v Speaker 2>costly process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are all sorts of mechanisms </v>

1056
00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:00.004
<v Speaker 2>that you could study in the context of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a religion that demonstrate why one </v>

1057
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.090
<v Speaker 2>spreads and another one doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1058
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:06.933
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using the example that you just </v>

1059
00:48:07.931 --> 00:48:08.764
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also a lot to get out of Judaism </v>

1060
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:12.310
<v Speaker 2>because they not a Jew anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody cares.</v>

1061
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.220
<v Speaker 2>But if you were to get out of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know this with the PA states all over</v>

1062
00:48:15.221 --> 00:48:17.090
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might get killed on,</v>

1063
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:21.310
<v Speaker 2>but to kill means to correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're just sounded right.</v>

1064
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:22.720
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1065
00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 2>we take all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1066
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.860
<v Speaker 2>we get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that this mode of thinking is,</v>

1067
00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.550
<v Speaker 2>is not great for the world and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>

1068
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:31.420
<v Speaker 2>You want to use things from a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1069
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:32.930
<v Speaker 2>So when I had Peter Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1070
00:48:32.931 --> 00:48:35.680
<v Speaker 2>and he wrote a book called a manual for </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating atheists.</v>

1071
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:36.514
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I read it and I thought it was </v>

1072
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:39.970
<v Speaker 2>really great book and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to use some of those,</v>

1073
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>practices when I've talked to people </v>

1074
00:48:42.071 --> 00:48:42.904
<v Speaker 2>about this stuff and I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does he think that like what's the </v>

1075
00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:47.680
<v Speaker 2>difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>

1076
00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:48.723
<v Speaker 2>if someone holds some of these beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't doing anything nefarious and </v>

1077
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:55.720
<v Speaker 2>isn't pushing these ideas on anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you still think it's bad?</v>

1078
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.480
<v Speaker 2>And he basically said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he,</v>

1079
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:59.020
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1080
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.033
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quoting him exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you're diluting yourself and </v>

1081
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 2>that's not really what the point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being human is.</v>

1082
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.200
<v Speaker 2>What would you say in that case if </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone just picked some beliefs?</v>

1083
00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.080
<v Speaker 2>It's nominal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cares,</v>

1084
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:11.914
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not oppressing someone or </v>

1085
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.320
<v Speaker 2>making women dress a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1086
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.213
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1087
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.500
<v Speaker 2>it depends if I want to be pragmatic or </v>
<v Speaker 2>a purist,</v>

1088
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:18.603
<v Speaker 2>if I want to be pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say you don't believe whatever you </v>

1089
00:49:20.051 --> 00:49:20.884
<v Speaker 2>want as long as you don't impose your </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs on third parties that I don't </v>

1090
00:49:23.501 --> 00:49:24.730
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the pragmatic part.</v>

1091
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.250
<v Speaker 2>If I were to be a purist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1092
00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.333
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pursuit of truth matters than I </v>

1093
00:49:30.881 --> 00:49:31.714
<v Speaker 2>would agree then with Peter that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in these types of fairytales is </v>

1094
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.890
<v Speaker 2>actually injurious to the human spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1095
00:49:38.891 --> 00:49:43.891
<v Speaker 2>So that in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's not propagating violence or</v>

1096
00:49:44.051 --> 00:49:44.884
<v Speaker 2>something on someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's against the sort of human </v>

1097
00:49:46.991 --> 00:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>nature or something like that.</v>

1098
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:48.940
<v Speaker 2>And if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1099
00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:49.774
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and many atheists have talked about </v>

1100
00:49:51.251 --> 00:49:52.084
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1101
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:57.270
<v Speaker 2>there is a wonder that you can access </v>
<v Speaker 2>without needing religion.</v>

1102
00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.070
<v Speaker 2>What religion does in a sense is it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1103
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.570
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it covers the capacity.</v>

1104
00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:02.404
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go and see a beautiful landscape </v>

1105
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.373
<v Speaker 2>and be transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent by the experience without </v>

1106
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:09.970
<v Speaker 2>needing Booga Booga to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1107
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.920
<v Speaker 2>for me to actually experience that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1108
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:12.873
<v Speaker 2>So it actually cheapens life to always </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to contextualize it within the </v>

1109
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:19.740
<v Speaker 2>context of a big data in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1110
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I think I've told this story on the show</v>
<v Speaker 2>once before,</v>

1111
00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:22.414
<v Speaker 2>but I want ate pot brownies and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to see air force one with friends </v>

1112
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:29.570
<v Speaker 2>and it was sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we moved,</v>

1113
00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 2>we went and saw contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see contact?</v>

1114
00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.760
<v Speaker 2>This is what the costs are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was written.</v>

1115
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:37.040
<v Speaker 2>It was Carl Sagan is only fiction book.</v>

1116
00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1117
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:42.350
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what the movie was at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what we were walking into.</v>

1118
00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:43.323
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the opening scene was this </v>

1119
00:50:44.361 --> 00:50:47.140
<v Speaker 2>incredible panorama of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I ate these pop around,</v>

1120
00:50:47.141 --> 00:50:47.974
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was basically like tripping out of my </v>

1121
00:50:49.191 --> 00:50:51.820
<v Speaker 2>mind and the whole movie just blew my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind apart.</v>

1122
00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing.</v>

1123
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:53.714
<v Speaker 2>I ended up reading a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Charles Dickens books and all that and </v>

1124
00:50:55.671 --> 00:50:58.010
<v Speaker 2>it sort of led me to a lot of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think now,</v>

1125
00:50:58.011 --> 00:51:01.400
<v Speaker 2>but the movie ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has this sort of a,</v>

1126
00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:02.653
<v Speaker 2>not that satisfying experience because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she can't prove that what happened to </v>

1127
00:51:05.451 --> 00:51:10.040
<v Speaker 2>her actually happened and the movie ends</v>
<v Speaker 2>with her just looking out on a sunset.</v>

1128
00:51:10.041 --> 00:51:13.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are ways to,</v>

1129
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.493
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel connected and feel a part of this </v>

1130
00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:22.860
<v Speaker 2>thing that don't necessarily standing up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sitting a lot at a.</v>

1131
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:27.680
<v Speaker 2>actually that was one of the starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>points that got me away from religion.</v>

1132
00:51:27.681 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 2>We were sitting at a synagogue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a again Avraham in Beirut.</v>

1133
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1134
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.960
<v Speaker 2>and I asked my father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1135
00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When do we stand up when we sit down?</v>

1136
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:39.650
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't shut up.</v>

1137
00:51:39.651 --> 00:51:40.484
<v Speaker 2>Just the fact that he said that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>upsets me because already as I don't </v>

1138
00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:45.860
<v Speaker 2>remember how old I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe five,</v>

1139
00:51:45.861 --> 00:51:46.694
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

1140
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:49.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that left a hole in me.</v>

1141
00:51:49.001 --> 00:51:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you mean?</v>

1142
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Why am I standing up and sitting down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give me an explanation.</v>

1143
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:53.923
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that there was sort of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dogmatism a is probably the </v>

1144
00:51:57.651 --> 00:52:01.310
<v Speaker 2>starting point of what led me astray </v>
<v Speaker 2>from religion,</v>

1145
00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.413
<v Speaker 2>but to come back to atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written an article in psychology </v>

1146
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:07.810
<v Speaker 2>today blog where I talked about carpet </v>
<v Speaker 2>den,</v>

1147
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seizing the day.</v>

1148
00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.880
<v Speaker 2>And that atheism is really consistent </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that ethos,</v>

1149
00:52:13.881 --> 00:52:15.050
<v Speaker 2>right of living in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1150
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.260
<v Speaker 2>There are no do overs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no eternal life.</v>

1151
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:20.720
<v Speaker 2>It's now is the relationship that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>formed.</v>

1152
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Now it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the knowledge that I helped spread.</v>

1153
00:52:23.331 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Now it's the goodness that I can impart </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the world.</v>

1154
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.823
<v Speaker 2>And so that actually makes it a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more a wonderful experience to realize </v>

1155
00:52:32.781 --> 00:52:34.490
<v Speaker 2>that you have a very short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited time.</v>

1156
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it's very scary,</v>

1157
00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:36.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1158
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:37.453
<v Speaker 2>you and I want this party to go on </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever and that's why I think actually </v>

1159
00:52:40.341 --> 00:52:44.780
<v Speaker 2>that religion will never a sister exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll never eradicate it because we will</v>

1160
00:52:44.781 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 2>never resolve the problem of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>existential angst.</v>

1161
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.373
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say the word eradicate </v>

1162
00:52:50.841 --> 00:52:52.060
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that the,</v>

1163
00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:52.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1164
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.480
<v Speaker 2>the progressives who have launched this </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge assault on new atheist,</v>

1165
00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:00.200
<v Speaker 2>they sort of came up with this term new </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist and I guess originally it had to</v>

1166
00:53:00.201 --> 00:53:04.150
<v Speaker 2>do with a hitchins and Sam and Daniel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennett I think,</v>

1167
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.120
<v Speaker 2>and who is the fourth?</v>

1168
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a fourth in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris,</v>

1169
00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1170
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:13.130
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these new atheists,</v>

1171
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.460
<v Speaker 2>they're not just atheist to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell they want to believe.</v>

1172
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.533
<v Speaker 2>They want to destroy religion and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they spread this meme as a way of </v>

1173
00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:24.830
<v Speaker 2>silencing people who would critique </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1174
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.260
<v Speaker 2>That to me is all they've done here </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have now I know many,</v>

1175
00:53:28.261 --> 00:53:29.094
<v Speaker 2>many atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know no atheist that is trying to use </v>

1176
00:53:31.651 --> 00:53:36.651
<v Speaker 2>violence or intimidation in any way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop anyone from believing anything.</v>

1177
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may critique you,</v>

1178
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.280
<v Speaker 2>they may ridicule you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should they be quiet,</v>

1179
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.830
<v Speaker 2>but why should they be quiet now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shove your religion.</v>

1180
00:53:43.831 --> 00:53:44.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all day long.</v>

1181
00:53:44.611 --> 00:53:45.760
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should be quiet.</v>

1182
00:53:45.761 --> 00:53:46.830
<v Speaker 2>And my non belief why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1183
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm not suggesting that you should ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>be and polite.</v>

1184
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can be nice and you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>polite about it,</v>

1185
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:52.920
<v Speaker 2>but I have to be quiet.</v>

1186
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I was quiet when I was living as a Jew </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Lebanon.</v>

1187
00:53:55.591 --> 00:53:57.360
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be quiet anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

1188
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:58.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really interesting.</v>

1189
00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:00.210
<v Speaker 2>So that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all it is,</v>

1190
00:54:00.211 --> 00:54:01.044
<v Speaker 2>when they say new atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they mean really is an atheist who </v>

1191
00:54:03.371 --> 00:54:04.710
<v Speaker 2>speaking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>

1192
00:54:04.711 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 2>that's what they hate more than any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you seen some of my,</v>

1193
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.780
<v Speaker 2>a satirical traits of our new atheism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I've said,</v>

1194
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:12.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1195
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I used to weigh 200 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I put on 10 pounds.</v>

1196
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm now a new atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have this skin tone.</v>

1197
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:20.873
<v Speaker 2>Then I went on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became the new atheists is a term </v>

1198
00:54:23.281 --> 00:54:25.090
<v Speaker 2>that's complete nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>

1200
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:28.290
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to do a little more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1201
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:29.124
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regressive stuff when we sit down </v>

1202
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:30.953
<v Speaker 2>with Lalo and a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just curious for you personally </v>

1203
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.110
<v Speaker 2>as you've been part of this discussion.</v>

1204
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:37.943
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just sat down for the first time in </v>

1205
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:41.280
<v Speaker 2>August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we only met about eight months ago.</v>

1206
00:54:41.281 --> 00:54:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I probably only knew of you on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>for maybe three,</v>

1207
00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:46.710
<v Speaker 2>four months before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you've become part of this.</v>

1208
00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:47.553
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious how much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of it consumes you actually </v>

1209
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:52.343
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know how personal this is to </v>

1210
00:54:53.551 --> 00:54:54.384
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that I have trouble shutting it </v>

1211
00:54:55.261 --> 00:54:57.870
<v Speaker 2>off sometimes at night and I don't mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>just my phone,</v>

1212
00:54:57.871 --> 00:54:59.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean just the thought process and </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that,</v>

1213
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:03.650
<v Speaker 2>that there is something big going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>here that were part of a.</v>

1214
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:06.390
<v Speaker 2>How big does it feel to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very big.</v>

1215
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.253
<v Speaker 2>And often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would say that the last six </v>

1216
00:55:08.731 --> 00:55:13.731
<v Speaker 2>months I've spent maybe 50 percent of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>time working on these types of issues as</v>

1217
00:55:15.541 --> 00:55:18.450
<v Speaker 2>opposed to say Mike sort of classic </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific career.</v>

1218
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Precisely because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>

1219
00:55:20.821 --> 00:55:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I defined my role more broadly than just</v>
<v Speaker 2>as somebody who's a professor,</v>

1220
00:55:25.441 --> 00:55:26.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1221
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.470
<v Speaker 2>I can engage the public in the battle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and,</v>

1222
00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.393
<v Speaker 2>and frankly I'm quite disappointed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of my colleagues who don't think </v>

1223
00:55:34.201 --> 00:55:34.591
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1224
00:55:34.591 --> 00:55:35.424
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody is contesting the fact that it's </v>

1225
00:55:36.421 --> 00:55:38.790
<v Speaker 2>really important to do your great basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

1226
00:55:38.791 --> 00:55:39.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you are,</v>

1227
00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 2>you're a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a scientist,</v>

1228
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:44.220
<v Speaker 2>but if you've got the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

1229
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:45.353
<v Speaker 2>then it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is important for you to also </v>

1230
00:55:46.801 --> 00:55:51.000
<v Speaker 2>participate in battles of ideas that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside your very limited,</v>

1231
00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lab studies.</v>

1232
00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in that sense,</v>

1233
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.493
<v Speaker 2>I actually have been quite consumed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the issues you're saying now </v>

1234
00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.373
<v Speaker 2>where I sometimes regrets my </v>
<v Speaker 2>participation is when I don't know when </v>

1235
00:56:02.851 --> 00:56:07.380
<v Speaker 2>to stop aging some ass who's constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>hounding me.</v>

1236
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Now in many cases I'm able to disengage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a few times they kind of,</v>

1237
00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:12.563
<v Speaker 2>they trigger you in some way and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you engage this person and you realize </v>

1238
00:56:15.151 --> 00:56:15.984
<v Speaker 2>you just wasted an hour and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking to somebody who was in his </v>

1239
00:56:17.971 --> 00:56:19.450
<v Speaker 2>underwear and his mom's basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1240
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1241
00:56:20.041 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to dive more into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you and allow a little bit.</v>

1242
00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:23.921
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1243
00:56:23.921 --> 00:56:24.754
<v Speaker 2>so look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could talk forever and this is my </v>

1244
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:27.820
<v Speaker 2>second interview in a row where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't even picked up my,</v>

1245
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.740
<v Speaker 2>my notes once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1246
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:32.410
<v Speaker 2>but because I started by talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>college and that's what you just brought</v>

1247
00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:33.670
<v Speaker 2>this to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1248
00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:34.613
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the hope Gimme Gimme the point </v>

1249
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:37.323
<v Speaker 2>for some of this turning now I guess we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can talk about this stuff and we see it </v>

1250
00:56:40.421 --> 00:56:43.660
<v Speaker 2>that there is this now movement growing </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people that aren't afraid of speaking</v>

1251
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:44.494
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff.</v>

1252
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:49.690
<v Speaker 2>How do you as a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fuel that you can win this and did you</v>

1253
00:56:49.691 --> 00:56:50.710
<v Speaker 2>feel it right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1254
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:55.770
<v Speaker 2>it's precisely and empowering every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single individual to engage the debate.</v>

1255
00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:58.323
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I receive endless private messages from </v>

1256
00:57:00.401 --> 00:57:03.010
<v Speaker 2>people whom I've never met them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never see again.</v>

1257
00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:04.083
<v Speaker 2>So you don't just because I watch how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you behave and how much you've got to </v>

1258
00:57:07.031 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 2>lose professionally and if not also </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>

1259
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:12.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean in terms of threats and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1260
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:13.353
<v Speaker 2>this has gotten me the courage to speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>out against some of my regressive </v>

1261
00:57:17.051 --> 00:57:17.884
<v Speaker 2>friends on facebook and I just spent </v>
<v Speaker 2>three hours taken on these guys and I </v>

1262
00:57:21.131 --> 00:57:23.020
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have done it had I not seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>your courage.</v>

1263
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:28.200
<v Speaker 2>So basically all you're trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to empower people to feel as though they</v>

1264
00:57:28.571 --> 00:57:30.730
<v Speaker 2>can make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by having enough of that,</v>

1265
00:57:30.731 --> 00:57:33.460
<v Speaker 2>because think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regressive left is quite,</v>

1266
00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:34.473
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an invested in this fight and all you </v>

1267
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:40.570
<v Speaker 2>need to do is stand up and offer a </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterpoint and get enough people to do</v>

1268
00:57:40.571 --> 00:57:41.280
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1269
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Truth is on our side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will win.</v>

1270
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what enrages them more than </v>

1271
00:57:45.131 --> 00:57:47.050
<v Speaker 2>anything else to wrap this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what enrages them,</v>

1272
00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:49.660
<v Speaker 2>is that they've been sort of unchecked </v>
<v Speaker 2>example all the time.</v>

1273
00:57:49.661 --> 00:57:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1274
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.133
<v Speaker 2>because they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the right in a lot of respects </v>

1275
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:57.400
<v Speaker 2>has gone off the deep end so that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was no rational argument to be had.</v>

1276
00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.860
<v Speaker 2>Now here come us and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1277
00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:01.300
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have some rational </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments,</v>

1278
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:04.350
<v Speaker 2>but they have been doing the whole cries</v>
<v Speaker 2>of racism,</v>

1279
00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.630
<v Speaker 2>not a monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1280
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:09.730
<v Speaker 2>And there's a new company that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>offering another product.</v>

1281
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.310
<v Speaker 2>They're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.910
<v Speaker 2>What we're going to beat and with better</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

1283
00:58:12.911 --> 00:58:13.900

<v Speaker 2>We will.</v>

1284
