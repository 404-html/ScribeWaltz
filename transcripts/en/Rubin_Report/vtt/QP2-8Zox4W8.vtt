1
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>With the Christmas season upon us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's recap the year today,</v>

2
00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>both for the wider world as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great community that we've built here at</v>

3
00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Note,</v>

4
00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:13.694
<v Speaker 1>I did say Christmas season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not holiday season or winter </v>

5
00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>spectacular or whatever else the PC </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd wants us to say these days.</v>

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that the wide majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the United States do celebrate</v>

7
00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Christmas and whether you celebrate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

8
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:28.184
<v Speaker 1>there is goodness to be had in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of the season like being kind to </v>

9
00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>your fellow man when someone wishes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>a merry Christmas.</v>

10
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>That is not an affront to Hanukah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kwanza,</v>

11
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Festivus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the cycle of the planets.</v>

12
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.173
<v Speaker 1>In many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably most cases wishing someone a </v>

13
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:44.354
<v Speaker 1>merry Christmas is more of just an </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledgement of the holiday season </v>

14
00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:49.940
<v Speaker 1>rather than some sort of religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>edict.</v>

15
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the same token,</v>

16
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:52.454
<v Speaker 1>if you're offended that someone wished </v>
<v Speaker 1>you happy holidays instead of Merry </v>

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.833
<v Speaker 1>Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps your offense meter is out of </v>

18
00:00:58.131 --> 00:00:58.460
<v Speaker 1>whack.</v>

19
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.293
<v Speaker 1>To the point is that it's the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>year in 2016 has been particularly </v>

20
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:04.634
<v Speaker 1>divisive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's try to find some joy in one </v>

21
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:07.814
<v Speaker 1>another and wish good tidings even to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who weren't that good to us this </v>

22
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.913
<v Speaker 1>past year on the world front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 16 will go down as one of the </v>

23
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:19.370
<v Speaker 1>craziest years ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump becoming the next president</v>

24
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>of the United States was clearly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest story,</v>

25
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>but England choosing brexit instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>staying in the European Union as well as</v>

26
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>the continued humanitarian disaster in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria.</v>

27
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>We'll all have major impacts as we move </v>
<v Speaker 1>into 2017 and beyond.</v>

28
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.813
<v Speaker 1>More than anything else though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 16 taught us that at least here </v>

29
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:38.234
<v Speaker 1>in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power is still with the people in </v>

30
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:45.530
<v Speaker 1>both trump's win and the brexit vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of the media,</v>

31
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:47.090
<v Speaker 1>the elites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the establishment,</v>

32
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:50.420
<v Speaker 1>and the money was on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet despite this,</v>

33
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>the people rose up and change the course</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world with their votes.</v>

34
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.453
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not like the results of either </v>

35
00:01:56.481 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>of those two events and you may not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with the electoral college or with</v>

36
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:00.914
<v Speaker 1>the tactics of the brexit tiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to acknowledge that there </v>

37
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:05.004
<v Speaker 1>is something amazing and the ability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in a western democracy to truly </v>

38
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Speaker 1>control their own destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people on Earth would give anything</v>

39
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>to have this much control over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that they live in.</v>

40
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.593
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolutions which swept throughout </v>

41
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:19.934
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East over the past few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're done with the hopes that the </v>

42
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:23.594
<v Speaker 1>people could one day have as much sway </v>
<v Speaker 1>over their leaders as we have in the </v>

43
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:27.974
<v Speaker 1>West right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While these revolutions haven't worked </v>

44
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:31.094
<v Speaker 1>out as planned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seeds of freedom had been planted </v>

45
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>and even if Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya,</v>

46
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>and obviously Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rn is free as we want them to be.</v>

47
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 1>The ideas of freedom have taken root </v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to the Internet.</v>

48
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Most of us now walk around with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in our pocket.</v>

49
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>We're connected in incredible ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing the world right in front of us.</v>

50
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 1>No longer do we have to get our </v>
<v Speaker 1>information from only a few sources.</v>

51
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.733
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any and all of us can be a source of </v>

52
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>information all over the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

53
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>this barrier to entry creates other </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems like who can we actually trust,</v>

54
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.653
<v Speaker 1>but I would always veer on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having access to more information than </v>

55
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:08.644
<v Speaker 1>less information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look at how the mainstream media </v>

56
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>has reacted to the trump win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they offer us any real introspection</v>

57
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>and reevaluate their tactics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>methods?</v>

58
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>

59
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.893
<v Speaker 1>Instead they doubled down on identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and name calling and at the </v>

60
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:24.034
<v Speaker 1>same time the mainstream media told us </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anything that's sanctioned by them </v>

61
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.533
<v Speaker 1>is fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the very people who invented fake </v>

62
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:32.284
<v Speaker 1>news or warning you about fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know the tide is beginning to </v>

63
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:36.274
<v Speaker 1>turn.</v>

64
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.013
<v Speaker 1>The issue is that I've tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>highlight over the past year from the </v>

65
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:41.254
<v Speaker 1>importance of free speech to having </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest political discourse really </v>

66
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>encompass everything which moved our </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in 2016,</v>

67
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>the stifling of free speech by using </v>
<v Speaker 1>cries of racism and bigotry.</v>

68
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.473
<v Speaker 1>Shut down honest conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant topics like Islamism and </v>

69
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a direct line from that stifling</v>

70
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>of hard but important conversations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>led us to brexit and trump.</v>

71
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.873
<v Speaker 1>Couple the inability or unwillingness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have difficult conversations about </v>

72
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:11.074
<v Speaker 1>important issues with the hyper partisan</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting that we now have where people </v>

73
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>literally drop friends and family </v>
<v Speaker 1>members over political disagreements and</v>

74
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:19.534
<v Speaker 1>you have a toxic stew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having honest conversations without </v>

75
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:23.554
<v Speaker 1>resorting to demagoguery will be trump's</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest challenge and it's one that I </v>

76
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>hope that he will succeed at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that trump's good at winning,</v>

77
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.353
<v Speaker 1>but will he be gracious enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that his win isn't just for </v>

78
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:35.014
<v Speaker 1>himself and his supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for the people who voted </v>

79
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 1>against him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they're still shouting about it?</v>

80
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This very second.</v>

81
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that if trump focuses </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the economy and infrastructure,</v>

82
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>if he doesn't get us involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary military conflicts and if he</v>

83
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:51.244
<v Speaker 1>unleashes the tech sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we could have another American </v>

84
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.604
<v Speaker 1>renaissance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are huge gifts amongst many other </v>

85
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:58.204
<v Speaker 1>ifs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now if you root for trump to </v>

86
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you root for our country to fail.</v>

87
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.473
<v Speaker 1>More important than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we had been able to have more honest </v>

88
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:08.134
<v Speaker 1>and enlightened conversations in 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 1>than perhaps the world would feel a </v>

89
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>little more sensible than it does right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

90
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>

91
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>We don't like when people discriminate </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the basis of religion,</v>

92
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:19.474
<v Speaker 1>which is simply a set of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have no problem when people </v>

93
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>discriminate based on political </v>
<v Speaker 1>affiliation,</v>

94
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.833
<v Speaker 1>which also is just a set of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tolerance of different opinions will be </v>

95
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>our biggest national challenge in 2017.</v>

96
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.723
<v Speaker 1>Accepting that not everyone agrees with </v>
<v Speaker 1>us all the time and not only is that </v>

97
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:37.924
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually preferable will be </v>

98
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>something that we all have to put into </v>
<v Speaker 1>action in this coming year.</v>

99
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 1>We had our share of group think in 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everyone seemed to go into their</v>

100
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:49.024
<v Speaker 1>little bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully 2017 is where we burst them </v>

101
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>and we see what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joining me this week is Tim Ferriss.</v>

102
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.703
<v Speaker 1>Tim is no stranger talking to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>from every walk of life and from every </v>

103
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>corner of the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His podcast,</v>

104
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.194
<v Speaker 1>the Tim Ferriss show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is over 100 million downloads and he's </v>

105
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:06.524
<v Speaker 1>chatted with people from Sam Harris and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Schwartzenegger to Tim Robbins </v>

106
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:11.264
<v Speaker 1>and Kevin Costner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been described as the oprah of </v>

107
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.143
<v Speaker 1>podcasting and his new book tools of </v>
<v Speaker 1>titans is a compilation of some of the </v>

108
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 1>best habits he's learned from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>various guests.</v>

109
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.303
<v Speaker 1>It seems fitting to veer into the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 as an interviewer interviewing an </v>

110
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>interviewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If 2016 was the year of outrage,</v>

111
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>then let's have 2017 be the year of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

112
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Joining me this week is an author and </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur,</v>

113
00:06:40.861 --> 00:06:41.694
<v Speaker 1>a speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a master of all kinds of cool </v>

114
00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:46.830
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some have called him the Oprah of audio.</v>

115
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Tim Ferriss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

116
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having me.</v>

117
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 1>The Oprah of audio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you like that moniker?</v>

118
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be the striking resemblance that</v>

119
00:06:57.781 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

120
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm flattered by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

121
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.553
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't ask for more flattering </v>

122
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.103
<v Speaker 2>moniker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I think it still remains to be </v>

123
00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 2>seen if I can live up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's been a trip and audio,</v>

124
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.350
<v Speaker 2>my experimental career in audio.</v>

125
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever given your audience cars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has everyone got in the car yet?</v>

126
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've not done cars yet.</v>

127
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I've done a tee shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushroom coffee,</v>

128
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.750
<v Speaker 2>and a handful of other lower ticket </v>
<v Speaker 2>items.</v>

129
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes sardines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>canned sardines.</v>

130
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not yet.</v>

131
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Cars haven't made my way up to the cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

132
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sardines.</v>

133
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.693
<v Speaker 1>Very good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to talk about some of </v>

134
00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:40.540
<v Speaker 1>the things that you've given away in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the ideas that you,</v>

135
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:42.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you push amongst your crowd.</v>

136
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.533
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was feeling undue pressure to ask the </v>

137
00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:48.010
<v Speaker 1>right questions this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm all right at this,</v>

138
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.060
<v Speaker 1>but I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

139
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Tim Ferriss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's known as asking good questions.</v>

140
00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:53.494
<v Speaker 1>So the first question I'm going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go abroad with you for a </v>

141
00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:57.160
<v Speaker 1>number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the person that's watching this,</v>

142
00:07:57.161 --> 00:08:00.010
<v Speaker 1>that has no idea who tim ferriss is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

143
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:03.040
<v Speaker 1>if such a person exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say is,</v>

144
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.650
<v Speaker 1>what is the mission of Tim Ferriss?</v>

145
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.893
<v Speaker 2>Tim Ferriss is a self experimenter who </v>
<v Speaker 2>runs experiments with the help of some </v>

146
00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:16.210
<v Speaker 2>of the world's top performers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be scientists,</v>

147
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:18.640
<v Speaker 2>could be athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be entrepreneurs,</v>

148
00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:19.510
<v Speaker 2>ceos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

149
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.673
<v Speaker 2>And then writes about the results so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that readers can have the cliff notes </v>

150
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:28.410
<v Speaker 2>version and that is really the gist of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

151
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Out All of my experiments work out as </v>
<v Speaker 2>planned,</v>

152
00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:32.314
<v Speaker 2>which make for entertaining reading and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a tragic injury on my part in some </v>

153
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:36.904
<v Speaker 2>cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking I view myself as </v>

154
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 2>as an experimentalist and a teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not primarily writer and it is my job to</v>

155
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.633
<v Speaker 2>push the extremes and do all of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy lifting so that my readers do not </v>

156
00:08:49.181 --> 00:08:49.860
<v Speaker 2>have to.</v>

157
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.540
<v Speaker 1>When did you get interested in all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

158
00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Was there a point like when you were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school or junior high,</v>

159
00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:55.104
<v Speaker 1>were you always the limits of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do and trying to figure out what </v>

160
00:08:58.201 --> 00:08:59.034
<v Speaker 1>was next</v>

161
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.810
<v Speaker 2>in a sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was starting probably around age 13,</v>

162
00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 2>14 and that was competitive wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

163
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.810
<v Speaker 2>I was put into kiddie wrestling when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was probably 10 by.</v>

164
00:09:08.811 --> 00:09:09.644
<v Speaker 2>My mom was very hyperactive and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>moms recommended that as a way to </v>

165
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.760
<v Speaker 2>diffuse things and a drain my batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was also a very,</v>

166
00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:17.594
<v Speaker 2>very small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born premature and I was very </v>

167
00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:19.874
<v Speaker 2>small up until about sixth grade and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this case you had weight classes so the </v>

168
00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:24.974
<v Speaker 2>60 pound weaklings could battle the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other 60 pound weaklings and someone </v>

169
00:09:27.081 --> 00:09:27.914
<v Speaker 2>could come out on top and as I moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>further ahead and got better at </v>

170
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:34.130
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized there was a huge advantage in</v>

171
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.143
<v Speaker 2>a recording your workouts and training </v>
<v Speaker 2>approaches be recording the technical </v>

172
00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:42.080
<v Speaker 2>practice and see getting very good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight cutting,</v>

173
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.530
<v Speaker 2>so actually become very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at cutting weight,</v>

174
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.393
<v Speaker 2>which I don't recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a healthy thing to do because </v>

175
00:09:48.201 --> 00:09:49.850
<v Speaker 2>it's primarily dehydration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

176
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.590
<v Speaker 1>you literally would not drink water </v>
<v Speaker 1>right for,</v>

177
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.453
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it just a couple of days before and </v>

178
00:09:55.671 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 1>then right before the match you'd like </v>
<v Speaker 1>down hold?</v>

179
00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no water.</v>

180
00:09:59.500 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

181
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.743
<v Speaker 2>you dehydrate and then rehydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would actually cut from my senior </v>

182
00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:03.934
<v Speaker 2>year one 78 to 1:52</v>
<v Speaker 2>is 26 pounds twice a week and that was </v>

183
00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:12.220
<v Speaker 2>done between 12 and 18 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To do that without ever having some type</v>

184
00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:13.054
<v Speaker 2>of organ failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get a good basic </v>

185
00:10:15.071 --> 00:10:17.710
<v Speaker 2>understanding of sodium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potassium.</v>

186
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.380
<v Speaker 2>how all of these things work together so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really,</v>

187
00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:21.214
<v Speaker 2>really damage yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw the rewards there from </v>

188
00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:25.714
<v Speaker 2>documentation and experimentation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then later to start applying that to </v>

189
00:10:28.841 --> 00:10:29.674
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

190
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in a weird way you were sorta,</v>

191
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>you were kind of like a scientist as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

192
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:35.184
<v Speaker 1>YOu were using your own body as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the experiment and you were </v>

193
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 1>documenting everything and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing what worked.</v>

194
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:41.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

195
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.180
<v Speaker 2>And actually went to high school with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the son of george plimpton,</v>

196
00:10:46.181 --> 00:10:49.060
<v Speaker 2>who I only really came to appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 2>later as one of the first,</v>

197
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.433
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could call them a fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>immersive participatory journalists who </v>

198
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.313
<v Speaker 2>would try to play a professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>football game or box someone like a </v>

199
00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.593
<v Speaker 2>sonny liston for a few rounds and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>write about the experiment about the </v>

200
00:11:00.881 --> 00:11:02.350
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is,</v>

201
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.930
<v Speaker 2>this is not a new tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have done it,</v>

202
00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:05.764
<v Speaker 2>but I think that I was one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>two at least popularized really taking </v>

203
00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:11.160
<v Speaker 2>the physical component,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

204
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.330
<v Speaker 2>to an extreme degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all the,</v>

205
00:11:13.331 --> 00:11:16.600
<v Speaker 2>all the principles can be applied or </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them can be applied to the world</v>

206
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.463
<v Speaker 2>of business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can be applied to the world of say </v>

207
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:20.973
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The language learning the principles </v>

208
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.200
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

209
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.280
<v Speaker 2>are very flexible.</v>

210
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the four hour work week I think was </v>

211
00:11:27.051 --> 00:11:28.940
<v Speaker 1>really the first thing that put you on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the map in a,</v>

212
00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:31.100
<v Speaker 1>in a bigger sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

213
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

214
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:33.590
<v Speaker 1>I saw you a couple of weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had dinner.</v>

215
00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I was worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

216
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.760
<v Speaker 1>can I eat carbs in front of him or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

217
00:11:37.761 --> 00:11:39.890
<v Speaker 1>You were very nonjudgmental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>

218
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me,</v>

219
00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I've been building this studio for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last month.</v>

220
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I have had one of the craziest month in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my 40 years on earth.</v>

221
00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my eating habits have been terrible.</v>

222
00:11:50.331 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I literally haven't been to the gym and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

223
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I just have not had a moment to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get any of that.</v>

224
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would you say to somebody that's</v>

225
00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:58.024
<v Speaker 1>really when you're in the thick of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when life is actually just you're just </v>

226
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:03.190
<v Speaker 1>thrown in the river and you just gotta </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

227
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 1>you can't fight the current and it's for</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you want to do.</v>

228
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.880
<v Speaker 1>How would you recommend I manage some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

229
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 1>this time and stress and all this stuff?</v>

230
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:12.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think that there are a few </v>

231
00:12:14.731 --> 00:12:19.731
<v Speaker 2>different questions that I tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>depend on in situations like that.</v>

232
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.030
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just,</v>

233
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.953
<v Speaker 2>I just completed a 700 page book in less</v>
<v Speaker 2>than four months and that's for me </v>

234
00:12:31.381 --> 00:12:32.214
<v Speaker 2>unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of my book projects had been three </v>

235
00:12:33.541 --> 00:12:36.780
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're working with.</v>

236
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the font,</v>

237
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.980
<v Speaker 2>it was like four words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The page laid out beautifully and the,</v>

238
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.880
<v Speaker 2>the question that I returned to </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently was what would this look like</v>

239
00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:48.714
<v Speaker 2>if it were easy or what might this look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if it were easy and brainstorming </v>

240
00:12:53.521 --> 00:12:56.400
<v Speaker 2>seemingly absurd answers to questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

241
00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:58.470
<v Speaker 2>what if I had to write this book in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week?</v>

242
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.810
<v Speaker 2>I knew I wasn't going to attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 2>write it in a week,</v>

243
00:13:00.811 --> 00:13:03.960
<v Speaker 2>but what if I had to add a gun against </v>
<v Speaker 2>my head and you can,</v>

244
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.913
<v Speaker 2>you can generate ideas that fall outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your current constraints that you've </v>

245
00:13:09.151 --> 00:13:10.680
<v Speaker 2>applied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that makes any sense.</v>

246
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.050
<v Speaker 2>So in the case of building a studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the case of say,</v>

247
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:18.420
<v Speaker 2>recording my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I very often am trying to prevent the,</v>

248
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:23.280
<v Speaker 2>I think very natural tendency towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity and sophistication,</v>

249
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

250
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.763
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes I think that whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>building a studio or writing a book and </v>

251
00:13:28.411 --> 00:13:29.244
<v Speaker 2>there are benefits to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to discount the value of </v>

252
00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:31.644
<v Speaker 2>what I'm about to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I remember when I was writing my </v>

253
00:13:33.121 --> 00:13:36.420
<v Speaker 2>second book and I told an author friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mine,</v>

254
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 percent done.</v>

255
00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:39.181
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

256
00:13:39.181 --> 00:13:41.040
<v Speaker 2>congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only have half left.</v>

257
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.703
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it makes sense to put in that </v>

258
00:13:45.361 --> 00:13:46.194
<v Speaker 2>last 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other times it makes sense to actually </v>

259
00:13:48.151 --> 00:13:52.380
<v Speaker 2>get started and experiment with less </v>
<v Speaker 2>than perfect.</v>

260
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

261
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.950
<v Speaker 2>it's very context dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those would be a few,</v>

262
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.100
<v Speaker 2>a meta kind of approaches that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking.</v>

263
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.350
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can also apply certainly things like</v>

264
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.630
<v Speaker 2>the 80 slash 20 principle to just about </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

265
00:14:03.631 --> 00:14:06.600
<v Speaker 2>so you have credos law or the 80 slash </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 principle,</v>

266
00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:08.700
<v Speaker 2>which you could look at it a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>

267
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.400
<v Speaker 2>So one is you could ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

268
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:17.570
<v Speaker 2>what 20 percent of the equipment or </v>
<v Speaker 2>activities or infrastructure gives me 80</v>

269
00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:20.730
<v Speaker 2>percent of the output that I want in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case of a studio.</v>

270
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conversely,</v>

271
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:23.663
<v Speaker 2>if you've already been working on it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>say a week and you have three weeks </v>

272
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.863
<v Speaker 2>scheduled left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could ask yourself what are the 20 </v>

273
00:14:29.791 --> 00:14:32.720
<v Speaker 2>percent of gear or activities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

274
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.563
<v Speaker 2>or personnel for that matter who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>causing 80 percent or more of the </v>

275
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.180
<v Speaker 2>emotions that I do not want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

276
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.023
<v Speaker 2>and that could create a not to do list </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a four now omit list to be assessed </v>

277
00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:46.230
<v Speaker 2>in the future list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those are some of the,</v>

278
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.233
<v Speaker 2>the tools and frameworks that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to use in a situation like that or </v>

279
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.020
<v Speaker 2>from juggling my real sort of financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>career as,</v>

280
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:55.400
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as tech investor.</v>

281
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 2>And then I stopped doing that about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year and a half ago,</v>

282
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:00.230
<v Speaker 2>but in fact the matter is I have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>portfolio of say 70 companies.</v>

283
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot to manage in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

284
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.333
<v Speaker 2>so these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the types of questions that I </v>

285
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 2>will ask myself and people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>running these fast,</v>

286
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:08.803
<v Speaker 2>growIng companies very often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How hard is it for you to delegate some </v>

287
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:13.970
<v Speaker 2>of that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 70 tech companies,</v>

288
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot going on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would assume,</v>

289
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.660
<v Speaker 2>basically virtually impossible to really</v>
<v Speaker 2>know the nitty gritty of every one.</v>

290
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you don't even want to know the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nitty gritty of everyone.</v>

291
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 2>And some are probably more passion </v>
<v Speaker 2>projects than others.</v>

292
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.293
<v Speaker 2>How easy is it for you to delegate some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that and have a core group of people </v>

293
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:33.070
<v Speaker 2>to trust that can advise you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I is,</v>

294
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to the angel investing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I delegate very little.</v>

295
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.513
<v Speaker 2>I do have a small team who will work </v>
<v Speaker 2>with companies on very specific aspects </v>

296
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:42.074
<v Speaker 2>of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversion optimization or user </v>

297
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 2>interface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that based on my direction.</v>

298
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.833
<v Speaker 2>But I've also phased how I at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically have done investments that </v>

299
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:57.551
<v Speaker 2>I only have of those 70 say five to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximum who actively need my help at any</v>

300
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:00.254
<v Speaker 2>given point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the the one of the signs that </v>

301
00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:05.360
<v Speaker 2>accompany is probably going to do poorly</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>

302
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:08.650
<v Speaker 2>if they constantly want your input,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should.</v>

303
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.170
<v Speaker 2>They should be spending a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage of that time having their own</v>

304
00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:15.350
<v Speaker 2>opinions and in building mode and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

305
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 2>if they're constantly in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>procrastinating,</v>

306
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:20.600
<v Speaker 2>doing the work by asking for advice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you,</v>

307
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.483
<v Speaker 2>you generally take that as a red flag </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the thing is you're going to go </v>

308
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 2>sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

309
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:26.954
<v Speaker 2>I tend to face things that I only have </v>
<v Speaker 2>five to 10 activity any given point in </v>

310
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I have a,</v>

311
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I would say a process that I impose on </v>
<v Speaker 2>each of those initial interactions.</v>

312
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:37.783
<v Speaker 2>So then I'm checking boxes and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>required typically a fair amount of </v>

313
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:44.510
<v Speaker 2>homework and introspection on the part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the companies.</v>

314
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.403
<v Speaker 2>So I'm able to pace it in that respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that I have more than </v>

315
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.833
<v Speaker 2>five companies or a five to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say come to me in a given month </v>

316
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.940
<v Speaker 2>with any type of time sensitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirement.</v>

317
00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.460
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

318
00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.293
<v Speaker 2>they're generally pretty thoughtful </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and since I'm working in the </v>

319
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.923
<v Speaker 2>venture backed tech arena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best founders and ceos understand </v>

320
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:08.294
<v Speaker 2>how to interact with say a board of </v>
<v Speaker 2>directors and they would treat me not </v>

321
00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:13.490
<v Speaker 2>quite as a member of the board of </v>
<v Speaker 2>directors certainly,</v>

322
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.324
<v Speaker 2>but they would understand how to best </v>
<v Speaker 2>utilize my time because they've done </v>

323
00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:20.930
<v Speaker 2>that with board members already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as the tech guy,</v>

324
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.610
<v Speaker 2>how realistic is silicon valley show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

325
00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:28.640
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's spot on and a lot of ways.</v>

326
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

327
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I think it is very accurate in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>respects,</v>

328
00:17:33.831 --> 00:17:37.220
<v Speaker 2>which is why I find it so funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the second season,</v>

329
00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 2>although a lot in the first season as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

330
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.113
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a uncannily accurate and in a lot </v>

331
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Speaker 2>of respects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't take that as a bad thing.</v>

332
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean silicon valley is a quirky part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>

333
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.780
<v Speaker 2>but if it weren't quirky it wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is.</v>

334
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:56.280
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be able,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

335
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.350
<v Speaker 2>to produce a lot of what it produces and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

336
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has its flaws and its foibles,</v>

337
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.980
<v Speaker 2>but that's true of any location where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

338
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.370
<v Speaker 2>tend to have a mano conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

339
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:09.204
<v Speaker 2>So if you go to Washington dc and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the motto conversation of </v>

340
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 2>government and politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird,</v>

341
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:16.044
<v Speaker 2>weird place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to say los angeles and you have </v>

342
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:21.840
<v Speaker 2>in many places the mano conversation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>

343
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.420
<v Speaker 2>That's a really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird environment.</v>

344
00:18:24.421 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Speaker 2>I would argue weirder in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then silicon valley and silicon valley,</v>

345
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:29.424
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's texts that you have just as much </v>

346
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:35.840
<v Speaker 2>weirdness and a ecentric behavior to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>it politely as,</v>

347
00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.250
<v Speaker 2>as all of those other places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

348
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if you'll know the answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this,</v>

349
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:43.020
<v Speaker 1>but how monotheism mono be monotheistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>monolithic.</v>

350
00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:45.690
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A monotheistic would be something else.</v>

351
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.620
<v Speaker 1>How monolithic is sort of the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>think up in silicon valley,</v>

352
00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:50.161
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>

353
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the election,</v>

354
00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:52.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were all these articles written </v>

355
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.610
<v Speaker 1>about peter teal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the bad boy of silicon valley.</v>

356
00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:57.444
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't think like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed odd to me that they were </v>

357
00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:00.211
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

358
00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:01.044
<v Speaker 1>we can find one guy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he likes putting himself out </v>

359
00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:03.774
<v Speaker 1>there and he obviously he spoke at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rnc and he's backed trump and all that </v>

360
00:19:06.961 --> 00:19:07.890
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is the,</v>

361
00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:11.820
<v Speaker 1>is the political group think they're as </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong as as it seems to be?</v>

362
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I would say so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very.</v>

363
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may be.</v>

364
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I may be a getting a little above my pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>grade in terms of,</v>

365
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:26.040
<v Speaker 2>of of subject areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not an area of expertise for me,</v>

366
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:26.874
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

367
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.433
<v Speaker 2>there is such an echo chamber I think in</v>
<v Speaker 2>silicon valley in many respects or just </v>

368
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:33.874
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the bay area that it's easy for </v>

369
00:19:36.131 --> 00:19:41.131
<v Speaker 2>everyone there to pat themselves on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in a very aggressive,</v>

370
00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.203
<v Speaker 2>hyper liberal slash progressive way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>look down their nose at what they would </v>

371
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:52.120
<v Speaker 2>perceive as the rest of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

372
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:57.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a noxious and sanctimonious and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of respects and is also very,</v>

373
00:19:57.011 --> 00:20:01.070
<v Speaker 2>very counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

374
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.163
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how far we want to go down </v>

375
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.360
<v Speaker 2>the political rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can do it,</v>

376
00:20:04.361 --> 00:20:05.290
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

377
00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:07.360
<v Speaker 2>there's part of me that feels like,</v>

378
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably,</v>

379
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get myself into trouble </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

380
00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:12.874
<v Speaker 2>but it's a spaghetti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a smugness that I think is part of </v>

381
00:20:15.491 --> 00:20:16.324
<v Speaker 2>the reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is someone speaking as I would </v>

382
00:20:18.371 --> 00:20:18.730
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

383
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.650
<v Speaker 2>very socially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least liberal person,</v>

384
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that smugness is part of the reason they</v>

385
00:20:23.651 --> 00:20:24.860
<v Speaker 2>got their teeth kicked in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

386
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.630
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

387
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.463
<v Speaker 2>they went in really underestimating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition and sort of carp launch </v>

388
00:20:33.461 --> 00:20:34.294
<v Speaker 2>writing off everybody who was leaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards trump as stupid or ignorant or </v>

389
00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.070
<v Speaker 2>racist even worse or fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be.</v>

390
00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:45.100
<v Speaker 2>And that created a huge blind spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

391
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gigantic blind spot underestimating the,</v>

392
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flaws in polling methodology I think</v>

393
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 2>was also something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that from a rational perspective,</v>

394
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 2>if for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

395
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:05.041
<v Speaker 2>I know my brothers is a effectively a </v>
<v Speaker 2>phd.</v>

396
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 2>He's finishing his dissertation in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in statistics.</v>

397
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.150
<v Speaker 2>He called trump months before it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

398
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.013
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

399
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.430
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's absolutely going to win.</v>

400
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.170
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is not,</v>

401
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 2>he would not position himself as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative in any,</v>

402
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 2>in any respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

403
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Scott Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creator of dilbert,</v>

404
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 2>also on my podcast called it kinda blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>for blow how it was going to go down.</v>

405
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

406
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:29.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

407
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that,</v>

408
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:36.130
<v Speaker 2>just to get back to your question that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a lot of group think in silicon</v>

409
00:21:36.131 --> 00:21:36.964
<v Speaker 2>valley and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the irony of that I think is Worth </v>

410
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:40.534
<v Speaker 2>underscoring because it's supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>this think different place and yet it </v>

411
00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:47.284
<v Speaker 2>has all of its own baggage and group </v>
<v Speaker 2>think just like every other place that </v>

412
00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:53.890
<v Speaker 2>has a mono conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

413
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:56.340
<v Speaker 2>and then you have someone like peter </v>
<v Speaker 2>teal a couple long enough.</v>

414
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I've spent time with peter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a close friend,</v>

415
00:21:58.871 --> 00:21:59.704
<v Speaker 2>but I've had dinner at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been a group dinners with him a number </v>

416
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:05.710
<v Speaker 2>of times and he's a smart guy.</v>

417
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:06.603
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing that I thought to </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself when he came out in support of </v>

418
00:22:10.901 --> 00:22:14.620
<v Speaker 2>trump wasn't how could he do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

419
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:16.720
<v Speaker 2>what am I missing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I missing?</v>

420
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.390
<v Speaker 2>There's something I'm missing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I missing?</v>

421
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Because teal is not need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly in my experience,</v>

422
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.540
<v Speaker 2>very impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>short term thinker.</v>

423
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.310
<v Speaker 2>That's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just not him.</v>

424
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

425
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

426
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.180
<v Speaker 2>from the very outset I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I missing?</v>

427
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Like is there some tWenty year long bed </v>
<v Speaker 2>or short bed that he's making right now?</v>

428
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:43.180
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what aspects of this am I missing?</v>

429
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:44.080
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

430
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.780
<v Speaker 2>I do think there's a lot of group </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking silicon valley,</v>

431
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.003
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just creates blind spots and opens </v>

432
00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:51.934
<v Speaker 2>the door for then not only disruptive </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology to say trying to cut out off </v>

433
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.540
<v Speaker 2>a yahoo or someone like that at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees,</v>

434
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.260
<v Speaker 2>but it creates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

435
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:03.940
<v Speaker 2>vulnerabilities in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

436
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.800
<v Speaker 2>in a political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a political landscape.</v>

437
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.720
<v Speaker 2>And I'm far beyond that.</v>

438
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious because you prefaced all of </v>

439
00:23:10.081 --> 00:23:10.914
<v Speaker 1>that by saying that you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about standing above your pay </v>

440
00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:13.294
<v Speaker 1>grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an interesting way to </v>

441
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:15.210
<v Speaker 1>preface that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

442
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you obviously are thought of as a </v>

443
00:23:17.111 --> 00:23:17.944
<v Speaker 1>thought leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but politics has become so toxic that I </v>

444
00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:21.964
<v Speaker 1>could sense you were choosing your words</v>
<v Speaker 1>very carefully there because you don't </v>

445
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:24.724
<v Speaker 1>want to upset anybody by slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>misspeaking or slightly misquoting </v>

446
00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>someone or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the general tenor of</v>

447
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 1>dialogue in the country right now?</v>

448
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it's ludicrous and self </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating.</v>

449
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I think that everyone should reread </v>
<v Speaker 2>fahrenheit 4:51</v>

450
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.310
<v Speaker 2>because if some people might recall </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading it in high school and they think</v>

451
00:23:43.311 --> 00:23:44.570
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

452
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:45.963
<v Speaker 2>did they tyrannical government that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing the burning of books and of </v>

453
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:53.660
<v Speaker 2>course the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the main characters,</v>

454
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:55.880
<v Speaker 2>but you have these firemen who are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>charge of burning books.</v>

455
00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 2>And what many people cease to realize if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they reread that book,</v>

456
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.633
<v Speaker 2>which they will rediscover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it was actually the people in </v>

457
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:08.390
<v Speaker 2>the beginning who started the burning of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the books.</v>

458
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Books that would offend any minority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean that in a racial group,</v>

459
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.610
<v Speaker 2>a racial sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a minority population,</v>

460
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>began to be burned.</v>

461
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.540
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is very,</v>

462
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:23.120
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous.</v>

463
00:24:23.121 --> 00:24:26.330
<v Speaker 2>And I think a very slippery slope where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have effectively,</v>

464
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.290
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

465
00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a number of people remark to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this effect,</v>

466
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.553
<v Speaker 2>you have the majority of smart people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who could discuss a topic and have the </v>

467
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:38.174
<v Speaker 2>necessary uncomfortable conversation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rational way opting out because the </v>

468
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.383
<v Speaker 2>personal downside is so high that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>outweighs in the minds of these people </v>

469
00:24:49.431 --> 00:24:52.010
<v Speaker 2>who could actually catalyze a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

470
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.083
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

471
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.923
<v Speaker 2>the collective longterm good is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently compelling to take an </v>

472
00:24:58.581 --> 00:25:02.120
<v Speaker 2>almost guaranteed short term or I should</v>
<v Speaker 2>say immediate,</v>

473
00:25:02.121 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 2>not short term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be very longterm,</v>

474
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.920
<v Speaker 2>but immediate personal hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

475
00:25:06.921 --> 00:25:08.180
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's terrible.</v>

476
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I think it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

477
00:25:09.561 --> 00:25:10.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest,</v>

478
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:14.390
<v Speaker 2>the thing that scares me most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States right now is,</v>

479
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:19.450
<v Speaker 2>is by far and away not what some leader </v>
<v Speaker 2>from on high would necessarily do to us.</v>

480
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.400
<v Speaker 2>It is what we were already doing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>

481
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:23.234
<v Speaker 2>And that is disinvited brilliant people </v>
<v Speaker 2>from speaking at universities because </v>

482
00:25:27.621 --> 00:25:28.454
<v Speaker 2>they might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might offer opinions or positions </v>

483
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:35.060
<v Speaker 2>that would make students uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole point.</v>

484
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:36.603
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to handle </v>

485
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.593
<v Speaker 2>macroaggression in real life if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't handle different opinions from </v>

486
00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:44.420
<v Speaker 2>your own in an academic setting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ludicrous.</v>

487
00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:45.490
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

488
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

489
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I get pretty lit up about this because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's,</v>

490
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:49.783
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very insidious problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is in some ways being viewed as a </v>

491
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:54.824
<v Speaker 2>solution and it is certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think not a beneficial in the long </v>

492
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.333
<v Speaker 2>term at all.</v>

493
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit on a bunch of my wheel house </v>

494
00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:03.994
<v Speaker 1>stuff there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the most interesting piece </v>

495
00:26:04.961 --> 00:26:05.794
<v Speaker 1>of that is that what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically good people who could really </v>

496
00:26:09.941 --> 00:26:12.190
<v Speaker 1>change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who could change people's minds,</v>

497
00:26:12.191 --> 00:26:14.920
<v Speaker 1>get involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not because of the personal</v>

498
00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:16.160
<v Speaker 1>cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would,</v>

499
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.950
<v Speaker 1>how can we unfurl that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

500
00:26:17.951 --> 00:26:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to bring on people here and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get to some of this,</v>

501
00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.580
<v Speaker 1>but I know and I can see it sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>with guests and I'm sure you can too.</v>

502
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:29.050
<v Speaker 1>You get to a place where they can't go </v>
<v Speaker 1>any further.</v>

503
00:26:29.051 --> 00:26:29.884
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cost of them talking about </v>

504
00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:33.550
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they're an expert in that,</v>

505
00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:37.450
<v Speaker 1>where they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm veering past that red line and I</v>

506
00:26:37.451 --> 00:26:39.880
<v Speaker 1>can get into some trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we bring that back?</v>

507
00:26:39.881 --> 00:26:40.714
<v Speaker 1>For those of us that want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible conversations and open </v>

508
00:26:43.801 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 1>discourse?</v>

509
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.113
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

510
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:45.973
<v Speaker 2>there's a word that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimenting with a creating odd words </v>

511
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:53.970
<v Speaker 2>and inserting them into the common </v>
<v Speaker 2>vernacular for two years.</v>

512
00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Now a one has made some rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

513
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.280
<v Speaker 2>this is one I did just for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll,</v>

514
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.130
<v Speaker 2>you'll see where I'm going here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

515
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:01.993
<v Speaker 2>it's dell adultery until adultery is </v>
<v Speaker 2>when a significant other or you watch a </v>

516
00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 2>tv show that you've agreed to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

517
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:10.230
<v Speaker 2>You watch it by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

518
00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:11.640
<v Speaker 2>that's tele daltrey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>

519
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.500
<v Speaker 2>But that traveled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the important point.</v>

520
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:16.920
<v Speaker 2>So that term traveled all over the place</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we were.</v>

521
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:19.920
<v Speaker 2>I was actually sitting in an airport </v>
<v Speaker 2>overseas with my mom and she'd say,</v>

522
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.600
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a funny word you would like.</v>

523
00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 2>And it was in a magazine and it was tele</v>
<v Speaker 2>is tele adultery.</v>

524
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:28.710
<v Speaker 2>This is where the I had created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a word that I currently,</v>

525
00:27:28.711 --> 00:27:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the,</v>

526
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.193
<v Speaker 2>the actors in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a suffocation of free speech or </v>

527
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 2>discouragement at the very least have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>open discourse.</v>

528
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.273
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think on many sides what some people </v>

529
00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:52.611
<v Speaker 2>have called social justice warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a who throw around terms like racist,</v>

530
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.520
<v Speaker 2>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigot of many different types,</v>

531
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.490
<v Speaker 2>very loosely in those terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

532
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.810
<v Speaker 2>can have lasting damage even if there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no evidence associated with them.</v>

533
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.813
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the accusation itself becomes the </v>

534
00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:08.304
<v Speaker 2>conviction and the term social justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>warriors not neutral in the sense that </v>

535
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:14.394
<v Speaker 2>it sounds positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there really isn't any linguistic </v>

536
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.623
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a equivalent to say racist that would </v>

537
00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:23.634
<v Speaker 2>discourage someone from behaving in such</v>
<v Speaker 2>a haphazard fashion and in a way that </v>

538
00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:29.190
<v Speaker 2>can destroy careers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriages,</v>

539
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:30.510
<v Speaker 2>you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

540
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.860
<v Speaker 2>so the term that I came up in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with eric weinstein,</v>

541
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.440
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really brilliant mathematician,</v>

542
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:41.440
<v Speaker 2>physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this term big,</v>

543
00:28:41.441 --> 00:28:43.050
<v Speaker 2>a tier that I thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So big.</v>

544
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:47.370
<v Speaker 2>A tier is clearly not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds terrible.</v>

545
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:48.503
<v Speaker 2>And it is someone who calls others </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigots for personal gain and that </v>

546
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:53.490
<v Speaker 2>personal gains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just be attention,</v>

547
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.340
<v Speaker 2>it could be absolving themselves of </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilt,</v>

548
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:57.203
<v Speaker 2>it could be clickthroughs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be yellow journalism and </v>

549
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.260
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible media just aiming for </v>
<v Speaker 2>clickbait and click throughs.</v>

550
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.393
<v Speaker 2>So I think that if big adhere were work </v>
<v Speaker 2>to become a real term applied to people </v>

551
00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:15.891
<v Speaker 2>who use these terms very loosely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it sounds silly,</v>

552
00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:17.844
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that words are what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack right now are affective words and </v>

553
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.260
<v Speaker 2>labels to discourage this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

554
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.193
<v Speaker 2>this behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one that has come to mind is </v>

555
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:34.080
<v Speaker 2>big a tier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think until we have some type of</v>

556
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:34.914
<v Speaker 2>disincentive from behaving in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>cauterizes or just stymies free speech </v>

557
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.033
<v Speaker 2>that we're not going to get very far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if the humans just respond to </v>

558
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:47.554
<v Speaker 2>incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think humans are necessarily </v>

559
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:49.144
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just creatures that respond to </v>

560
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:53.374
<v Speaker 2>incentives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to figure out how to set </v>

561
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:55.984
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the carrot or the stick sufficiently to </v>

562
00:29:57.491 --> 00:29:58.540
<v Speaker 2>get the behavior you want.</v>

563
00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying it's almost like every </v>

564
00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:04.300
<v Speaker 1>other animal on this earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I'm saying.</v>

565
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I love the phrase big here and I've</v>

566
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:07.990
<v Speaker 1>used it a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

567
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:10.000
<v Speaker 1>we're going to try something as of </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

568
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use a little bit of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they call the tim ferris effect,</v>

569
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:15.700
<v Speaker 1>which is that when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've had people on your show,</v>

570
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.880
<v Speaker 1>usually their book sales go up or their </v>
<v Speaker 1>clicks go up or whatever it is.</v>

571
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:19.923
<v Speaker 1>So we'll try a little something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll push out big a tier from today </v>

572
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:26.200
<v Speaker 1>going forward and like fee if we get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little tim ferris effect on that because</v>

573
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say social justice warrior,</v>

574
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:29.573
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a good thing for someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't know really the </v>

575
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 1>underpinnings of what's of what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on there.</v>

576
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

577
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

578
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.210
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll love for it.</v>

579
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.163
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's shift a little bit to your </v>

580
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:43.300
<v Speaker 1>podcast because we are both creatures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interview.</v>

581
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:44.560
<v Speaker 1>How am I doing so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way?</v>

582
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.840
<v Speaker 1>You're doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing great.</v>

583
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

584
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.753
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did you always think of yourself as </v>

585
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:51.484
<v Speaker 1>an interviewer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What made you want to do the podcast in </v>

586
00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:53.974
<v Speaker 1>that form?</v>

587
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I always thought of myself as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimenter and a teacher.</v>

588
00:30:58.581 --> 00:30:59.414
<v Speaker 2>I always thought I was going to teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>ninth grade actually because I was very </v>

589
00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:06.890
<v Speaker 2>much influenced by mentors at I think a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very critical,</v>

590
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.570
<v Speaker 2>critical juncture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A around that age.</v>

591
00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.440
<v Speaker 2>The ninth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10th grade kids make a lot of decisions.</v>

592
00:31:12.441 --> 00:31:13.274
<v Speaker 2>They don't realize you're going to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>them down one promising path or down a </v>

593
00:31:16.581 --> 00:31:18.590
<v Speaker 2>bad path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I digress.</v>

594
00:31:18.591 --> 00:31:19.424
<v Speaker 2>the point is that I view interviewing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tool in the toolkit for extracting </v>

595
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.263
<v Speaker 2>specific details and tactics that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>then impart to my readers who are I </v>

596
00:31:31.491 --> 00:31:36.200
<v Speaker 2>guess my students in this case for </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicating excellent results.</v>

597
00:31:36.201 --> 00:31:36.961
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

598
00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:39.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to tease oUt the cliff notes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and interviewing,</v>

599
00:31:39.441 --> 00:31:41.930
<v Speaker 2>askIng good questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking good follow up questions,</v>

600
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.153
<v Speaker 2>letting silence do the work at very </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific points is how you extract that </v>

601
00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:52.910
<v Speaker 2>gold and without the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview.</v>

602
00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:53.743
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do the research that I need to </v>

603
00:31:55.071 --> 00:31:58.550
<v Speaker 2>do and the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never expected to do anything.</v>

604
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really a commitment just to doing</v>

605
00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:02.503
<v Speaker 2>six episodes so that I wouldn't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made that public pronouncement do at </v>

606
00:32:06.951 --> 00:32:07.784
<v Speaker 2>least six episodes so that I'd be held </v>
<v Speaker 2>accountable and I want it to work on </v>

607
00:32:11.091 --> 00:32:11.924
<v Speaker 2>improving verbal ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to improve the selection and </v>

608
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.473
<v Speaker 2>follow up related to questions and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a more active listener because I </v>

609
00:32:21.201 --> 00:32:25.160
<v Speaker 2>knew that even if the podcast cratered </v>
<v Speaker 2>or I didn't like it and I quit,</v>

610
00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:26.383
<v Speaker 2>those were skills that would transfer </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere else and this is something </v>

611
00:32:31.731 --> 00:32:32.564
<v Speaker 2>that I actually borrowed a ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>and really developed after Scott Adams </v>

612
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:41.570
<v Speaker 2>of dilbert fame and calls it systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking instead of goals thinkIng,</v>

613
00:32:41.571 --> 00:32:42.404
<v Speaker 2>but thinking of how you can win even if </v>
<v Speaker 2>your project fails and the way you do </v>

614
00:32:45.951 --> 00:32:46.784
<v Speaker 2>that is by focusing on developing skills</v>
<v Speaker 2>and relationships that transcend that </v>

615
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.273
<v Speaker 2>and persist over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's really how I thought about it </v>

616
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:57.170
<v Speaker 2>and why I got into the audio game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was burned out on books,</v>

617
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take a break from big books.</v>

618
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.433
<v Speaker 2>And here we are.</v>

619
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear that.</v>

620
00:33:01.911 --> 00:33:04.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the followup question.</v>

621
00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I got a follow up for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how,</v>

622
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:11.810
<v Speaker 1>how scientific is that for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a follow up prepared,</v>

623
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 1>someone hands you the answer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically you expected,</v>

624
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.550
<v Speaker 1>do you always go to that follow up or </v>
<v Speaker 1>how willing are you to go out there?</v>

625
00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:20.384
<v Speaker 1>Because I find that to be a constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle sort of of me wanting to just </v>

626
00:33:24.081 --> 00:33:24.914
<v Speaker 1>have the natural flow of a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus I also want to hit on certain </v>

627
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:29.840
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to let theM off the hook on</v>

628
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:32.660
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let people hang themselves.</v>

629
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:34.700
<v Speaker 1>That's my method instead of shouting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them down.</v>

630
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a little more of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>method as well,</v>

631
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.840
<v Speaker 1>which is what I'm doing with you right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

632
00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:39.674
<v Speaker 1>very subtly.</v>

633
00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

634
00:33:40.561 --> 00:33:44.940
<v Speaker 2>I feel like like an invisible midget is </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangling me at the moment on my back,</v>

635
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.710
<v Speaker 2>her naked choking me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

636
00:33:46.711 --> 00:33:47.550
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

637
00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.000
<v Speaker 2>the question I think has very personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>answers in,</v>

638
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:52.853
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I say that is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>study some of the people best known for </v>

639
00:33:55.891 --> 00:33:57.510
<v Speaker 2>asking questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say Larry King.</v>

640
00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Larry king very often goes in doing next</v>
<v Speaker 2>to no homework on his guests.</v>

641
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:06.060
<v Speaker 2>The rationale being that the guest has </v>
<v Speaker 2>no familiarity,</v>

642
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience has no familiarity with the</v>

643
00:34:08.551 --> 00:34:13.440
<v Speaker 2>guest and he wants to start from where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are and asking the basic questions.</v>

644
00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:14.723
<v Speaker 2>Then you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say a james lipton of inside the actors </v>

645
00:34:17.791 --> 00:34:18.624
<v Speaker 2>studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has every question scripted in </v>

646
00:34:20.521 --> 00:34:23.790
<v Speaker 2>advance and he never deviates from his </v>
<v Speaker 2>order of questions.</v>

647
00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>End of story.</v>

648
00:34:25.351 --> 00:34:29.430
<v Speaker 2>He knows the answer in some form to </v>
<v Speaker 2>every question he's going to ask,</v>

649
00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.160
<v Speaker 2>so you have them on opposite ends of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>

650
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:32.993
<v Speaker 2>In my case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily have set followup </v>

651
00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.473
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do have a handful of questions </v>

652
00:34:38.311 --> 00:34:39.144
<v Speaker 2>which I've borrowed from other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that very often can turn a mediocre </v>

653
00:34:44.371 --> 00:34:45.204
<v Speaker 2>answer or a decent answer into a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer with a few extra details and </v>

654
00:34:49.231 --> 00:34:50.064
<v Speaker 2>layers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might have somebody ask them a </v>

655
00:34:51.421 --> 00:34:53.190
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they respond and then you say,</v>

656
00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.330
<v Speaker 2>what did you learn from that super easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow up question?</v>

657
00:34:57.331 --> 00:34:59.170
<v Speaker 2>You can ask almost any time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

658
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:03.390
<v Speaker 2>How did that make you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another really easy one.</v>

659
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.840
<v Speaker 2>That is kind of a layup oftentimes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

660
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:11.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't go in with a completely set </v>
<v Speaker 2>agenda.</v>

661
00:35:11.521 --> 00:35:13.590
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was interviewing margaret cho,</v>

662
00:35:13.591 --> 00:35:15.730
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were going to talk about.</v>

663
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.400
<v Speaker 1>We've got her next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is going to be good for me.</v>

664
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.231
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's awesome.</v>

665
00:35:19.231 --> 00:35:20.160
<v Speaker 2>She's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's great.</v>

666
00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:20.994
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we were talking about the craft of </v>

667
00:35:22.351 --> 00:35:25.920
<v Speaker 2>comedy and so on and handling hecklers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

668
00:35:25.921 --> 00:35:30.870
<v Speaker 2>You should ask her about that and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we ended up bringing up and touching</v>

669
00:35:30.871 --> 00:35:35.660
<v Speaker 2>on addiction in comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug addiction specifically in that,</v>

670
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:36.623
<v Speaker 2>that took us to a really place and if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had been stuck on script we wouldn't </v>

671
00:35:40.141 --> 00:35:40.974
<v Speaker 2>have explored it and that ended up being</v>
<v Speaker 2>just an incredibly fertile ground for </v>

672
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:47.640
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I try not to Be too fixed,</v>

673
00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:48.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do have my pet questions that I </v>

674
00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 2>like to ask as we all do.</v>

675
00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been offended by a guess?</v>

676
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.840
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that people ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a lot,</v>

677
00:35:56.841 --> 00:35:57.674
<v Speaker 1>that how can I sit with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe is against gay marriage and I'm </v>

678
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:01.723
<v Speaker 1>gay man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I sit with them and even if I </v>

679
00:36:03.531 --> 00:36:07.430
<v Speaker 1>hear their rationale and their not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean to me specifically,</v>

680
00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:11.030
<v Speaker 1>how can I tolerate that conversation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me it's like I may not like it,</v>

681
00:36:11.031 --> 00:36:11.864
<v Speaker 1>but I do have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of an interview is to </v>

682
00:36:13.461 --> 00:36:14.294
<v Speaker 1>try to understand why someone thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone ever said something they </v>

683
00:36:15.981 --> 00:36:17.660
<v Speaker 1>truly offended you.</v>

684
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's jumping to mind.</v>

685
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure that that's the case and it</v>

686
00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:29.810
<v Speaker 2>makes me think a bit of advice that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got from stephen dubner,</v>

687
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:31.123
<v Speaker 2>author of freakonomics or coauthor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least he collaborates with steven </v>

688
00:36:33.381 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 2>levin in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

689
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.293
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of went into a few different </v>

690
00:36:37.251 --> 00:36:38.084
<v Speaker 2>aspects of this in tools of titans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said it's very important to put </v>

691
00:36:40.491 --> 00:36:43.730
<v Speaker 2>away your moral compass in the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to problem solve.</v>

692
00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're collaborating </v>
<v Speaker 2>with other people.</v>

693
00:36:45.831 --> 00:36:46.664
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that you absolve </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself of moral decisions and </v>

694
00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:52.130
<v Speaker 2>judgments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Initially,</v>

695
00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.670
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to put,</v>

696
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:59.390
<v Speaker 2>if you want to generate as many possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions,</v>

697
00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:04.750
<v Speaker 2>including non obvious solutions or </v>
<v Speaker 2>lateral thinking solutions that you want</v>

698
00:37:04.851 --> 00:37:05.684
<v Speaker 2>to take the constraints and assumptions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you live with all day long and try </v>

699
00:37:08.991 --> 00:37:10.010
<v Speaker 2>to set them to the side.</v>

700
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.590
<v Speaker 2>When I'm interviewing someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

701
00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.900
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be Glenn Beck,</v>

702
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in san francisco.</v>

703
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm interviewing Glenn Beck,</v>

704
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:21.080
<v Speaker 2>if I'm interviewing a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

705
00:37:21.081 --> 00:37:24.740
<v Speaker 2>let's just say general stanley </v>
<v Speaker 2>mcchrystal or jocko willink.</v>

706
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:25.783
<v Speaker 2>So both from a extensive military </v>
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds versus someone who might </v>

707
00:37:29.421 --> 00:37:30.254
<v Speaker 2>view themselves as a extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say hyper progressive slash </v>

708
00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:38.054
<v Speaker 2>liberal pacifist while they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have opposing viewpoints on a lot of </v>

709
00:37:41.991 --> 00:37:42.824
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>

710
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:43.663
<v Speaker 2>what my ivy job as extracting </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically neutral a or a political </v>

711
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.650
<v Speaker 2>routines and habits and so on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can use.</v>

712
00:37:54.651 --> 00:37:55.484
<v Speaker 2>So one of the mistakes I think that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>as humans tend to make is that we throw </v>

713
00:38:00.171 --> 00:38:01.940
<v Speaker 2>the baby out with the bathwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We say,</v>

714
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:03.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with so and so on x.</v>

715
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:08.630
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to assume they have nothing to</v>

716
00:38:08.631 --> 00:38:09.464
<v Speaker 2>offer me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a huge mistake and it's a </v>

717
00:38:11.711 --> 00:38:12.760
<v Speaker 2>very costly mistakes.</v>

718
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.593
<v Speaker 2>So whenever I'm talking to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some of my friends I disagree </v>

719
00:38:16.791 --> 00:38:17.624
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vehemently about let's say nine out of </v>

720
00:38:21.171 --> 00:38:24.650
<v Speaker 2>10 of their core beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just call them political beliefs,</v>

721
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.533
<v Speaker 2>but as long as they will engage in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate and not try to shut it down with </v>

722
00:38:30.711 --> 00:38:32.660
<v Speaker 2>name calling and nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

723
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:36.580
<v Speaker 2>if they're willing to dance with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and spar and admit when they've.</v>

724
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:37.953
<v Speaker 2>If they are able to absorb new </v>
<v Speaker 2>information and consider new evidence </v>

725
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:48.270
<v Speaker 2>and change their viewpoints accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some cases I have no problem spending</v>

726
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:49.234
<v Speaker 2>time with those people and in in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the biggest mistakes we </v>

727
00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:54.870
<v Speaker 2>were talking about echo chambers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>silicon valley's,</v>

728
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:55.743
<v Speaker 2>that if you surround yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who hold all the same opinions </v>

729
00:38:58.511 --> 00:38:59.344
<v Speaker 2>that you do well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get very comfortable </v>

730
00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:03.244
<v Speaker 2>with comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not going to force you to </v>

731
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.140
<v Speaker 2>consider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

732
00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:11.050
<v Speaker 2>devil's advocate positions that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>diametrically opposed to your own.</v>

733
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.900
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's incredibly valuable </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

734
00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:17.230
<v Speaker 2>And some of my friends are the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to call bs.</v>

735
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Even in a group setting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At a dinner like,</v>

736
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.330
<v Speaker 2>like novel robuchon I love the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

737
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.750
<v Speaker 2>and I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel every conversation we have,</v>

738
00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:28.090
<v Speaker 2>I come out of having improved in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

739
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:33.300
<v Speaker 2>You'll be the first person to call me </v>
<v Speaker 2>out if I throw out some position or,</v>

740
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 2>or strong stance without evidence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationale to back it up.</v>

741
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:39.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

742
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.040
<v Speaker 1>and don't you relish in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

743
00:39:41.041 --> 00:39:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I think I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

744
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:43.343
<v Speaker 1>I think most people truly do and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've sort of been tricked or dumbed </v>

745
00:39:48.001 --> 00:39:48.834
<v Speaker 1>down to the point where we think if </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything goes a little against us that </v>

746
00:39:53.011 --> 00:39:55.190
<v Speaker 1>we have to lash out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so not,</v>

747
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.960
<v Speaker 1>that's so not fertile ground for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for growth.</v>

748
00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.161
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

749
00:39:59.161 --> 00:39:59.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

750
00:39:59.551 --> 00:40:04.551
<v Speaker 2>I think that one of the things I try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do a at least once a week,</v>

751
00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:05.483
<v Speaker 2>but preferably much more than this is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the weakest person in the room at </v>

752
00:40:08.911 --> 00:40:09.744
<v Speaker 2>something where I want to be in the room</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to lead me probably to </v>

753
00:40:13.321 --> 00:40:17.760
<v Speaker 2>feel insecure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe insufficient,</v>

754
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.133
<v Speaker 2>but whether it's training in a sport or </v>
<v Speaker 2>picking up a new skill or sitting down </v>

755
00:40:25.141 --> 00:40:25.974
<v Speaker 2>in a room where people are discussing </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be anything molecular biology or </v>

756
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.613
<v Speaker 2>politics where I feel like I'm in over </v>
<v Speaker 2>my head and that is how you average up </v>

757
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:42.600
<v Speaker 2>and I think you also average up by </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding yourself with people who can</v>

758
00:40:42.601 --> 00:40:47.601
<v Speaker 2>intelligently debate and not just use </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric to try to corner people,</v>

759
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.193
<v Speaker 2>but to actually go toe to toe with </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical arguments at least based on </v>

760
00:40:52.891 --> 00:40:54.330
<v Speaker 2>their own assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's.</v>

761
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.223
<v Speaker 2>If you want to become smarter and by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way like the race doesn't go to the </v>

762
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:02.640
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fittest in this situation means most</v>

763
00:41:02.641 --> 00:41:07.641
<v Speaker 2>adaptable and I think that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cornerstone of everything else.</v>

764
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of this new idea that </v>

765
00:41:10.621 --> 00:41:15.090
<v Speaker 1>everyone seems to think that they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have an opinion on everything?</v>

766
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at Russia right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever is going on with Russia and the</v>

767
00:41:19.171 --> 00:41:21.060
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to get into the minutia of</v>

768
00:41:21.061 --> 00:41:21.894
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that people who I've </v>

769
00:41:23.041 --> 00:41:23.874
<v Speaker 1>never seen talk about Russia before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I don't think are particularly </v>

770
00:41:26.611 --> 00:41:27.444
<v Speaker 1>informed or smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got an opinion and must </v>

771
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.910
<v Speaker 1>share that opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm for the free speech part.</v>

772
00:41:32.911 --> 00:41:33.744
<v Speaker 1>They do whatever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just this idea that everyone always </v>

773
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.330
<v Speaker 1>has to share everything.</v>

774
00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they.</v>

775
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.970
<v Speaker 2>They probably couldn't place rush on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>map.</v>

776
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

777
00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:44.700
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

778
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:48.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great gift and curse of the internet</v>

779
00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.930
<v Speaker 2>is that everyone has a voice now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means every smart people,</v>

780
00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.413
<v Speaker 2>every smart person as voice also means </v>
<v Speaker 2>every idiot has a voice and a more and </v>

781
00:42:00.841 --> 00:42:01.674
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is in part because I go out of </v>

782
00:42:04.141 --> 00:42:06.780
<v Speaker 2>my way to expose myself to people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew more about many,</v>

783
00:42:06.781 --> 00:42:09.870
<v Speaker 2>many domains than myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find myself.</v>

784
00:42:09.871 --> 00:42:11.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not pleading the fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

785
00:42:11.431 --> 00:42:12.264
<v Speaker 2>I will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm qualified to have an </v>

786
00:42:14.101 --> 00:42:17.040
<v Speaker 2>opinion on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say that in the last few years,</v>

787
00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.340
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the frequency of me saying that has just</v>

788
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.780
<v Speaker 2>skyrocketed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

789
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.920
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to have a strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion where I can't back it up.</v>

790
00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that it's fine to have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>informed opinion,</v>

791
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:39.260
<v Speaker 2>but there's informed confidence and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's uninformed cubistic stupidity.</v>

792
00:42:39.931 --> 00:42:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

793
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hope that people would lean more</v>

794
00:42:44.191 --> 00:42:46.110
<v Speaker 2>towards the farmer and away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ladder,</v>

795
00:42:46.111 --> 00:42:48.120
<v Speaker 2>but alas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

796
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:49.103
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a media culture where the eyeballs </v>

797
00:42:53.521 --> 00:42:58.521
<v Speaker 2>and ears tend to gravitate to the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>outlandish argument imaginable.</v>

798
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems that that tends to get a lot of</v>

799
00:43:03.751 --> 00:43:04.470
<v Speaker 2>the attention.</v>

800
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you ever tempted by that,</v>

801
00:43:07.231 --> 00:43:09.240
<v Speaker 1>that click portion of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

802
00:43:09.241 --> 00:43:10.074
<v Speaker 1>we know very easily we could title are </v>
<v Speaker 1>things differently and probably triple </v>

803
00:43:13.081 --> 00:43:15.670
<v Speaker 1>the clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could use mismeeting thumbnails.</v>

804
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean know all the games of the digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

805
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.133
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of people are playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been tempted to do any of </v>

806
00:43:21.241 --> 00:43:22.074
<v Speaker 1>that stuff?</v>

807
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:23.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

808
00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning,</v>

809
00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.753
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I had my first blog and if </v>

810
00:43:28.701 --> 00:43:31.070
<v Speaker 2>people out there want to laugh their </v>
<v Speaker 2>asses off,</v>

811
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:34.460
<v Speaker 2>they can look up just google tim ferriss</v>
<v Speaker 2>first blog.</v>

812
00:43:34.461 --> 00:43:35.294
<v Speaker 2>It is the most hideous disorganized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible mess you've ever seen on the </v>

813
00:43:40.071 --> 00:43:40.720
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

814
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.553
<v Speaker 2>it's really atrocious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the time I was told I had to </v>

815
00:43:45.231 --> 00:43:46.064
<v Speaker 2>mimic this person and how they did x.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to do 12 posts a day before noon </v>

816
00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:54.290
<v Speaker 2>to have any hope of ab and c it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

817
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:58.670
<v Speaker 2>all these arbitrary rules and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>me too game of mimicry.</v>

818
00:43:58.671 --> 00:44:03.671
<v Speaker 2>So I did try listicles and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that on some level works,</v>

819
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:10.130
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't me and it had no evergreen</v>
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>

820
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.570
<v Speaker 2>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been rewarded thankfully for trying</v>

821
00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:15.404
<v Speaker 2>to put together a really comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>material that lasts not only last </v>

822
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.731
<v Speaker 2>multiple years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the real estate,</v>

823
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:26.300
<v Speaker 2>if we're talking about print,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say actually goes up over time.</v>

824
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:27.590
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

825
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:28.483
<v Speaker 2>my google real estate appreciates over </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and some of my most popular posts </v>

826
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:34.224
<v Speaker 2>were written five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years ago and they still drive the </v>

827
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:36.864
<v Speaker 2>majority of traffic to my blog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have been tempted at points to do </v>

828
00:44:40.531 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately my fans,</v>

829
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very fortunate,</v>

830
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.460
<v Speaker 2>very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally very well educated.</v>

831
00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:48.613
<v Speaker 2>They are very vocal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I try to pull any of those </v>

832
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:54.600
<v Speaker 2>shenanigans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get punished very quickly for that.</v>

833
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:57.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good to be held accountable.</v>

834
00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:57.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

835
00:44:57.931 --> 00:45:00.170
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're uh,</v>

836
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.700
<v Speaker 1>we're in good company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

837
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:02.953
<v Speaker 1>What about just sort of the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling right now that the media </v>

838
00:45:06.441 --> 00:45:07.274
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter and youtube and google that </v>

839
00:45:09.801 --> 00:45:10.634
<v Speaker 1>there is some sort of censorshIp </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening related to either algorithms </v>

840
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.883
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>banning certain people like twitter for </v>

841
00:45:18.171 --> 00:45:20.660
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they banned milo.</v>

842
00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:21.831
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

843
00:45:21.831 --> 00:45:22.850
<v Speaker 1>they'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

844
00:45:22.851 --> 00:45:26.000
<v Speaker 1>the richard spencers on there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>verified.</v>

845
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:27.283
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to comment on the </v>

846
00:45:27.411 --> 00:45:29.060
<v Speaker 1>specifics of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just the general,</v>

847
00:45:29.061 --> 00:45:32.840
<v Speaker 1>like these companies are so close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>government right now.</v>

848
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:35.960
<v Speaker 1>and this is our information highway </v>
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

849
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:43.050
<v Speaker 2>This is a toughie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where I might use that line that</v>

850
00:45:43.051 --> 00:45:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

851
00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

852
00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:46.430
<v Speaker 1>He set me up with it.</v>

853
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not because I couldn't have an </v>

854
00:45:49.911 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 2>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like I,</v>

855
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:53.203
<v Speaker 2>I would have an obligation to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit down with people who work at </v>

856
00:45:56.391 --> 00:45:57.224
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and these places because I know </v>

857
00:45:58.911 --> 00:45:59.744
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people in all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies and have a real factual </v>

858
00:46:01.941 --> 00:46:04.020
<v Speaker 2>discussion about what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

859
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.590
<v Speaker 2>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think at the very least,</v>

860
00:46:06.591 --> 00:46:07.424
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to deal with bending or </v>
<v Speaker 2>preventing certain types of people from </v>

861
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:11.803
<v Speaker 2>voicing their opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be a consIstent playing </v>

862
00:46:14.421 --> 00:46:15.560
<v Speaker 2>field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

863
00:46:15.561 --> 00:46:16.394
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be moving goalposts and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules should be clear from the </v>

864
00:46:19.371 --> 00:46:20.204
<v Speaker 2>outset and they should apply to everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there shouldn't be one off </v>

865
00:46:24.111 --> 00:46:25.630
<v Speaker 2>exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

866
00:46:25.631 --> 00:46:30.631
<v Speaker 2>I think in most cases when we get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>algorithms and what is rewarded and what</v>

867
00:46:33.711 --> 00:46:36.860
<v Speaker 2>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are always unintended consequences</v>

868
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:41.630
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best design.</v>

869
00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Whether that is an algorithm or if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an incentive structure,</v>

870
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

871
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you incentivize any of your workers,</v>

872
00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:49.693
<v Speaker 2>let's say within an organization with </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain types of sales quotas and </v>

873
00:46:52.101 --> 00:46:52.934
<v Speaker 2>bonuses and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are always going to be sort of </v>

874
00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.940
<v Speaker 2>perverse side effects of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentives.</v>

875
00:46:58.941 --> 00:47:01.730
<v Speaker 2>That's always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that it's,</v>

876
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.863
<v Speaker 2>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

877
00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:07.760
<v Speaker 2>it's on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rational and important that we have high</v>

878
00:47:07.761 --> 00:47:10.010
<v Speaker 2>standards for how people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

879
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.233
<v Speaker 2>how people serve and curate data so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not proliferating fake news and </v>

880
00:47:16.431 --> 00:47:17.264
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can't be used as a weapon of </v>

881
00:47:17.981 --> 00:47:21.890
<v Speaker 2>propaganda in a very damaging capacity </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>

882
00:47:21.891 --> 00:47:22.724
<v Speaker 2>I think it's unreasonable to expect that</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these gigantic companies we're </v>

883
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:27.103
<v Speaker 2>dealing with technology and platforms </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a that is incomprehensible to most </v>

884
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:33.094
<v Speaker 2>people who aren't sitting down and being</v>
<v Speaker 2>shown what it looks like on some level </v>

885
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:38.260
<v Speaker 2>by say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an employee of google.</v>

886
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:39.094
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to even fathom what being </v>

887
00:47:40.811 --> 00:47:44.530
<v Speaker 2>google means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's unfair to expect them to get all</v>

888
00:47:44.531 --> 00:47:46.690
<v Speaker 2>the details right all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an evolving system,</v>

889
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:48.040
<v Speaker 2>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna make mistakes,</v>

890
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:49.303
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's good to hold them to a high </v>

891
00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:56.791
<v Speaker 2>standard but difficult to expect </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfection as they try to improve it.</v>

892
00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

893
00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:01.190
<v Speaker 2>so that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

894
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.073
<v Speaker 2>I would put safely in the category of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to reserve judgment until I </v>

895
00:48:04.451 --> 00:48:05.350
<v Speaker 2>have more information.</v>

896
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a pretty solid answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>for reserving judgment.</v>

897
00:48:08.311 --> 00:48:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still gave me something there.</v>

898
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:15.150
<v Speaker 1>How do you decide who to trust when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're getting your information,</v>

899
00:48:15.151 --> 00:48:17.250
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to people from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

900
00:48:17.251 --> 00:48:18.084
<v Speaker 1>in your case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite literally every walk of life </v>

901
00:48:19.321 --> 00:48:20.154
<v Speaker 1>probably that there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you decide who or what or what </v>

902
00:48:23.641 --> 00:48:27.270
<v Speaker 1>news organization or whatever else that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually feel is doing a fair,</v>

903
00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:28.104
<v Speaker 1>impartial job?</v>

904
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust organizations in general,</v>

905
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.273
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will try to identify specific </v>

906
00:48:35.351 --> 00:48:39.130
<v Speaker 2>people and if I'm really trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>triage,</v>

907
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I will identify people in my circle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends are in my network who may not be</v>

908
00:48:49.751 --> 00:48:52.570
<v Speaker 2>specialists in the domain that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>

909
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.270
<v Speaker 2>whether that's a cancer research or</v>

910
00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:00.020
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a san francisco local politics.</v>

911
00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:00.943
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how to most effect change with a </v>

912
00:49:02.481 --> 00:49:04.610
<v Speaker 2>given proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be super specific.</v>

913
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:05.833
<v Speaker 2>I will reach out to two or three of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends who I think will have already </v>

914
00:49:08.361 --> 00:49:13.361
<v Speaker 2>tried to vet a good sources of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information or simply good thinking.</v>

915
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:18.110
<v Speaker 2>So it could be people who are good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpreting the information.</v>

916
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:23.180
<v Speaker 2>People were acting as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as human aggregators and filters.</v>

917
00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:24.853
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost go out immediately to those </v>

918
00:49:26.211 --> 00:49:27.050
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance.</v>

919
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I very frequently bump into people.</v>

920
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reasonably involved with,</v>

921
00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:37.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both current and former military.</v>

922
00:49:37.281 --> 00:49:38.114
<v Speaker 2>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spent time at the defense language </v>

923
00:49:39.861 --> 00:49:42.890
<v Speaker 2>institute in monterey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly have a lot of friends who were</v>

924
00:49:42.891 --> 00:49:43.724
<v Speaker 2>former military and you bump into a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of folks running around calling </v>

925
00:49:49.881 --> 00:49:54.170
<v Speaker 2>themselves navy seals and a lot of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>are</v>

926
00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.860
<v Speaker 2>exaggerating what they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some very,</v>

927
00:49:58.861 --> 00:49:59.694
<v Speaker 2>very legitimate folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there are a lot of people who </v>

928
00:50:01.561 --> 00:50:05.550
<v Speaker 2>drive the legitimate folks crazy because</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they actually did was passed buds,</v>

929
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:06.623
<v Speaker 2>were never deployed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're running around selling navy </v>

930
00:50:08.971 --> 00:50:11.160
<v Speaker 2>seal workout routines and getting book </v>
<v Speaker 2>deals.</v>

931
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if in a case like that,</v>

932
00:50:13.291 --> 00:50:14.124
<v Speaker 2>I will immediately go to two or three of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends were from that community and </v>

933
00:50:15.901 --> 00:50:16.291
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

934
00:50:16.291 --> 00:50:17.124
<v Speaker 2>sniff test zero to 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you recommend I talk to this </v>

935
00:50:19.351 --> 00:50:23.250
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very hands on process.</v>

936
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:26.990
<v Speaker 2>I start from effectively a place of </v>
<v Speaker 2>distrust with,</v>

937
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:32.260
<v Speaker 2>with any mass media because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentives are not aligned with truth at</v>

938
00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 2>all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just are not.</v>

939
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and unfortunately,</v>

940
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:41.294
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reality of the business </v>

941
00:50:43.011 --> 00:50:44.990
<v Speaker 2>models of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of many of these,</v>

942
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:46.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

943
00:50:46.131 --> 00:50:46.964
<v Speaker 2>So even the individual participants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however much they may want to represent </v>

944
00:50:51.981 --> 00:50:52.814
<v Speaker 2>difficult or to divulge and discuss </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult truths are disincentivized </v>

945
00:50:57.231 --> 00:50:58.064
<v Speaker 2>from doing so because it may be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuanced that only five percent of the </v>

946
00:51:01.941 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 2>target audience will take the time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it and discuss it.</v>

947
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:08.840
<v Speaker 2>But when you're trying to monetize on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cpm basis,</v>

948
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:14.280
<v Speaker 2>the number of slideshows you can put on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a website then a,</v>

949
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:17.750
<v Speaker 2>you run into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you run into a conflict very quickly.</v>

950
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

951
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's unfortunate challenge of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

952
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.281
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

953
00:51:22.281 --> 00:51:24.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to siphon news.</v>

954
00:51:24.531 --> 00:51:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Another thing that I'll use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've no affiliation with this,</v>

955
00:51:26.781 --> 00:51:27.614
<v Speaker 2>this is a program called nuzzel and use </v>
<v Speaker 2>these eel and what that will do is it </v>

956
00:51:32.031 --> 00:51:32.864
<v Speaker 2>will aggregate the most shared stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the people I follow on twitter and </v>

957
00:51:39.801 --> 00:51:40.634
<v Speaker 2>it creates a digest of say the top 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories that have been shared the most </v>

958
00:51:44.571 --> 00:51:49.571
<v Speaker 2>by the people I have already selected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow and I've found that very useful,</v>

959
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:51.284
<v Speaker 2>but it in at any point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance right now or near </v>

960
00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 2>presidential elections really within six</v>
<v Speaker 2>months on either side,</v>

961
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:04.510
<v Speaker 2>it's just 99 percent noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at other periods it can be a very,</v>

962
00:52:07.011 --> 00:52:07.844
<v Speaker 2>very useful source of pre-filtered </v>
<v Speaker 2>information from folks I've already </v>

963
00:52:12.681 --> 00:52:16.910
<v Speaker 2>handpicked to follow on say twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for pattern matching,</v>

964
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been,</v>

965
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.010
<v Speaker 2>that's been very helpful for me.</v>

966
00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:20.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because I expected and hoped </v>

967
00:52:22.321 --> 00:52:23.154
<v Speaker 1>that after the election we'd have like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a low with politics one </v>

968
00:52:26.311 --> 00:52:27.144
<v Speaker 1>way or another and it's almost like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything has just been ramped up even </v>

969
00:52:30.361 --> 00:52:32.220
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious when you talk about,</v>

970
00:52:32.221 --> 00:52:33.054
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picking some people that you trust and </v>

971
00:52:33.841 --> 00:52:35.100
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

972
00:52:35.101 --> 00:52:35.934
<v Speaker 1>you are also from long island and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned on the show a couple of times </v>

973
00:52:38.971 --> 00:52:43.140
<v Speaker 1>before that one of my great joys over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the course of the election is that I was</v>

974
00:52:43.141 --> 00:52:43.974
<v Speaker 1>involved in a group text with three of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my old childhood from middle school </v>

975
00:52:47.251 --> 00:52:50.730
<v Speaker 1>friends and we sort of reconnected over </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics arguing all the time.</v>

976
00:52:50.731 --> 00:52:53.820
<v Speaker 1>One of the guys was a huge trump guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was a huge bernie guy.</v>

977
00:52:53.821 --> 00:52:57.900
<v Speaker 1>One was somewhere in between and then me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought this,</v>

978
00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:00.780
<v Speaker 1>these are people I trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I knew them from childhood.</v>

979
00:53:00.781 --> 00:53:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I know where they come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew theIr family,</v>

980
00:53:03.421 --> 00:53:05.580
<v Speaker 1>celebrated holidays with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff.</v>

981
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you do have a couple of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life like that</v>

982
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:12.530
<v Speaker 2>who I have completely diverging </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions?</v>

983
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverging opinions,</v>

984
00:53:13.661 --> 00:53:16.780
<v Speaker 1>but also that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the long history from childhood</v>

985
00:53:16.781 --> 00:53:17.614
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe are outside of what you do </v>

986
00:53:19.001 --> 00:53:21.680
<v Speaker 1>normally that you can go to and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

987
00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:23.410
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

988
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.353
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

989
00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.590
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

990
00:53:25.591 --> 00:53:26.424
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just came back from a bachelor </v>
<v Speaker 2>party for one of my oldest friends I've </v>

991
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:30.474
<v Speaker 2>known since we were kids and a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>eclectic group of guys who got to know </v>

992
00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:43.281
<v Speaker 2>one another before anyone was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrenched in a given career or anything</v>

993
00:53:43.531 --> 00:53:47.130
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very refreshing to have a,</v>

994
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I think in healthy to have those friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>who really don't have,</v>

995
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.793
<v Speaker 2>there's no potential or at least i don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think so would these guys certainly not </v>

996
00:53:55.891 --> 00:53:59.340
<v Speaker 2>any type of ulterior motive or </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional motivation.</v>

997
00:53:59.341 --> 00:54:03.150
<v Speaker 2>There's just none of that bs and noise </v>
<v Speaker 2>and static and nonsense.</v>

998
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>

999
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do have those folks for sure.</v>

1000
00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:07.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you deal with that part of it </v>

1001
00:54:08.261 --> 00:54:13.261
<v Speaker 1>that because of the nature of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do and the public persona around you,</v>

1002
00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.640
<v Speaker 1>people want things from you all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1003
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1004
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:18.900
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1005
00:54:18.901 --> 00:54:23.901
<v Speaker 2>and it's a tax that I've accepted I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay and it,</v>

1006
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:26.243
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be unreasonable for me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to complain about it since it is a </v>

1007
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:34.230
<v Speaker 2>byproduct of public exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've opted into,</v>

1008
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:36.083
<v Speaker 2>but it can be frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are times when people will </v>

1009
00:54:39.451 --> 00:54:40.284
<v Speaker 2>approach me and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll try to butter me up for a </v>

1010
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:43.463
<v Speaker 2>few weeks and do me a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always a tip off when I start </v>

1011
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:50.961
<v Speaker 2>getting a lot of unsolicited favors from</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who doesn't want anything.</v>

1012
00:54:52.291 --> 00:54:53.124
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you're going to send me a book in </v>

1013
00:54:55.861 --> 00:54:56.694
<v Speaker 2>two weeks that I don't want to read with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the expectation that I'm going to give </v>

1014
00:54:58.441 --> 00:55:00.150
<v Speaker 2>you a blurb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that's what's going to happen.</v>

1015
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:03.060
<v Speaker 2>And lo and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what happens.</v>

1016
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:03.923
<v Speaker 2>So I've had to set policies that allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>me to turn off entire categories of </v>

1017
00:55:10.831 --> 00:55:11.490
<v Speaker 2>requests.</v>

1018
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't do book forwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do book blurbs.</v>

1019
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:17.363
<v Speaker 2>I don't do fill in the blank across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>board a hundred percent just don't do </v>

1020
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:21.510
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1021
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every once in a blue moon,</v>

1022
00:55:23.251 --> 00:55:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll make an exception for someone I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know really well,</v>

1023
00:55:24.961 --> 00:55:27.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rare,</v>

1024
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or for instance,</v>

1025
00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:30.180
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not doing startup investing.</v>

1026
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.133
<v Speaker 2>So if you think you're gonna come to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference and talk to me about two or </v>

1027
00:55:33.721 --> 00:55:34.554
<v Speaker 2>three things you found on my wikipedia </v>
<v Speaker 2>page to try to develop some rapport and </v>

1028
00:55:37.621 --> 00:55:39.150
<v Speaker 2>then pitch me or startup at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night.</v>

1029
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Not going to happen.</v>

1030
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to hit you up because,</v>

1031
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:44.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're growing pretty rapidly here,</v>

1032
00:55:44.851 --> 00:55:46.470
<v Speaker 1>but a little seed money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1033
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:50.150
<v Speaker 2>And that happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>

1034
00:55:50.151 --> 00:55:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

1035
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.630
<v Speaker 2>I've had people in san francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is very unique to the,</v>

1036
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:55.543
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat like asperger's romanticizing </v>

1037
00:55:58.851 --> 00:56:01.880
<v Speaker 2>niche nature of silicon valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1038
00:56:01.881 --> 00:56:02.714
<v Speaker 2>I've had people I'm sitting at a dinner </v>
<v Speaker 2>with say a girlfriend and they will </v>

1039
00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.770
<v Speaker 2>literally come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull up a chair,</v>

1040
00:56:09.771 --> 00:56:13.550
<v Speaker 2>sit down and just start pitching apropos</v>
<v Speaker 2>of nothing.</v>

1041
00:56:13.551 --> 00:56:14.630
<v Speaker 2>No intro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>

1042
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:17.850
<v Speaker 2>I had one guy at south by southwest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1043
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.340
<v Speaker 2>I've had at least 12 guys try to pitch </v>
<v Speaker 2>me while I'm standing at a urinal,</v>

1044
00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 2>which is the right time,</v>

1045
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:27.490
<v Speaker 1>not a good elevator pitch you at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1046
00:56:27.491 --> 00:56:28.324
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how</v>

1047
00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:33.300
<v Speaker 2>good your pitches and it goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say it's a text that,</v>

1048
00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.680
<v Speaker 2>that I've had to accept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1049
00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:36.830
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1050
00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:38.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1051
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more cautious about any open </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended invite to have a conversation or a</v>

1052
00:56:46.471 --> 00:56:48.090
<v Speaker 2>coffee or a dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if someone says,</v>

1053
00:56:48.091 --> 00:56:49.860
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I introduce you to my friend joe?</v>

1054
00:56:49.861 --> 00:56:53.670
<v Speaker 2>He wants to grab a cup of coffee or like</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd love to come to dinner with us.</v>

1055
00:56:53.671 --> 00:56:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1056
00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.900
<v Speaker 2>if joe wanted something from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it be?</v>

1057
00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:00.750
<v Speaker 2>What would you guess?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want to know in advance,</v>

1058
00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:01.584
<v Speaker 2>like it's okay to have a pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to know what it is </v>

1059
00:57:03.361 --> 00:57:04.450
<v Speaker 2>beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1061
00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.760
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I think of it these days.</v>

1062
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:09.810
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's,</v>

1063
00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:12.500
<v Speaker 1>let's finish up by actually talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your new book.</v>

1064
00:57:12.501 --> 00:57:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Are you willing to talk about your new </v>
<v Speaker 1>book?</v>

1065
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:16.270
<v Speaker 2>I am willing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know twist,</v>

1066
00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:17.870
<v Speaker 2>twist the arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll go for it.</v>

1067
00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:19.520
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see What we can do here.</v>

1068
00:57:19.521 --> 00:57:20.354
<v Speaker 1>so a tool to tighten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is basically the collection of </v>

1069
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:26.690
<v Speaker 1>the best ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best practices that some of the most</v>

1070
00:57:26.691 --> 00:57:27.524
<v Speaker 1>interesting people that you've talked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the past couple of years have put </v>

1071
00:57:30.621 --> 00:57:34.370
<v Speaker 1>into practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess the easiest question at first</v>

1072
00:57:34.371 --> 00:57:35.204
<v Speaker 1>would be is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there just the general theme with </v>

1073
00:57:37.281 --> 00:57:38.114
<v Speaker 1>these heavy hitters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these people who are doing it that </v>

1074
00:57:40.491 --> 00:57:44.240
<v Speaker 1>we all would want to emulate and be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>and learn from is what is the.</v>

1075
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:45.500
<v Speaker 1>What is the general theme?</v>

1076
00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1077
00:57:47.121 --> 00:57:47.954
<v Speaker 2>I'll answer that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say also that in tools of </v>

1078
00:57:49.711 --> 00:57:51.780
<v Speaker 2>titans is really never intended to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

1079
00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:54.690
<v Speaker 2>It was just a notebook that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>compiling for my own use,</v>

1080
00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:59.840
<v Speaker 2>so it was going back over my own notes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to grab the most actionable routines and</v>

1081
00:58:01.291 --> 00:58:02.400
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gadgets,</v>

1082
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:03.263
<v Speaker 2>anything that I could apply immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>and test from all of these different </v>

1083
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.073
<v Speaker 2>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the themes I would say that </v>

1084
00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:15.030
<v Speaker 2>that first it's split into three </v>
<v Speaker 2>sections,</v>

1085
00:58:15.031 --> 00:58:17.610
<v Speaker 2>and this is how a lot of these guests </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about their lives,</v>

1086
00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:18.541
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy,</v>

1087
00:58:18.541 --> 00:58:19.374
<v Speaker 2>and wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the healthiest first because the </v>

1088
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:23.723
<v Speaker 2>most prolific thinkers and creatives in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book have also come to highly </v>

1089
00:58:30.541 --> 00:58:35.460
<v Speaker 2>prioritize physical function and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that manifests in a lot of ways.</v>

1090
00:58:35.461 --> 00:58:36.600
<v Speaker 2>But for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rick rubin,</v>

1091
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:39.480
<v Speaker 2>one of the most legendary music </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditionalist of the last 50 years,</v>

1092
00:58:39.481 --> 00:58:41.190
<v Speaker 2>introduced me to something called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chilly pad,</v>

1093
00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:46.080
<v Speaker 2>which I won't get too far into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but allows you to very precisely set the</v>

1094
00:58:46.081 --> 00:58:48.660
<v Speaker 2>temperature of the sheet that you lay on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your bed.</v>

1095
00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:53.040
<v Speaker 2>And it's been a complete game changer </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me and many other people.</v>

1096
00:58:53.041 --> 00:58:55.380
<v Speaker 2>And that also came up with super </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>

1097
00:58:55.381 --> 00:58:59.700
<v Speaker 2>So you find a lot of commonalities in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top.</v>

1098
00:58:59.701 --> 00:59:02.460
<v Speaker 2>One percent have multiple fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1099
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.120
<v Speaker 2>they have more in common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it might be chess,</v>

1100
00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:09.300
<v Speaker 2>military strategist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black market chemists,</v>

1101
00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:10.410
<v Speaker 2>you name it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1102
00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:11.603
<v Speaker 2>the top one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of those fields have a lot in </v>

1103
00:59:13.051 --> 00:59:16.350
<v Speaker 2>common more so than they have in common </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the b players.</v>

1104
00:59:16.351 --> 00:59:17.184
<v Speaker 2>In their own fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was really cool to see all of </v>

1105
00:59:20.281 --> 00:59:21.114
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say are very good at asking </v>

1106
00:59:22.341 --> 00:59:24.950
<v Speaker 2>seemingly absurd questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1107
00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 2>so that that is a commonality across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>

1108
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:28.813
<v Speaker 2>the whole gang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would have say there are a bunch </v>

1109
00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:31.514
<v Speaker 2>of billionaires in the book like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reid hoffman's and peter teals and marc </v>

1110
00:59:33.741 --> 00:59:35.360
<v Speaker 2>andreessen's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of folks.</v>

1111
00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 2>A peter teal I think is a very good </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

1112
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:41.630
<v Speaker 2>So he asks questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm paraphrasing,</v>

1113
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 2>but why can't you accomplish your 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>year plan in the next six months?</v>

1114
00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1115
00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:48.100
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1116
00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:48.933
<v Speaker 2>that's a very bold question and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to think on that and as </v>

1117
00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:58.310
<v Speaker 2>many people in this book do journal on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and actually sit down and freehand on</v>

1118
00:59:58.311 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 2>that question for three pages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just say,</v>

1119
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:02.203
<v Speaker 2>then you have to temporarily put aside </v>
<v Speaker 2>the constraints and assumptions that </v>

1120
01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 2>have led you to where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if it's your 10 year plan,</v>

1121
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.273
<v Speaker 2>you've set a timeframe and sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>incremental approach that doesn't work </v>

1122
01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:18.770
<v Speaker 2>at all if you're trying to cram it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>six months.</v>

1123
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:22.130
<v Speaker 2>So all of a sudden you have to come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with these very,</v>

1124
01:00:22.131 --> 01:00:27.131
<v Speaker 2>very potentially outlandish and absurd </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconventional answers.</v>

1125
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.130
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1126
01:00:30.131 --> 01:00:34.520
<v Speaker 2>what I have found also in these two go </v>
<v Speaker 2>together is that a.</v>

1127
01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.353
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry Page co founder of google has </v>

1128
01:00:38.061 --> 01:00:39.350
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to paraphrase this,</v>

1129
01:00:39.351 --> 01:00:40.184
<v Speaker 2>but what people miss about really big </v>
<v Speaker 2>audacious goals is that it's hard to </v>

1130
01:00:46.341 --> 01:00:50.360
<v Speaker 2>fail completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'll very often fail above everyone</v>

1131
01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:54.930
<v Speaker 2>else's success even if it's only a </v>
<v Speaker 2>partial when I'm.</v>

1132
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.350
<v Speaker 2>So you find a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like peter diamandis,</v>

1133
01:00:57.351 --> 01:01:01.040
<v Speaker 2>chairman of the xprize is working on all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these different exponential technologies</v>

1134
01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.640
<v Speaker 2>and spends a lot of time with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like ray kurzweil,</v>

1135
01:01:04.641 --> 01:01:05.474
<v Speaker 2>James Cameron and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When entrepreneurs are pitching him to </v>

1136
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:11.240
<v Speaker 2>try to get investment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he will ask them,</v>

1137
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.133
<v Speaker 2>and I'm paraphrasing all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you had to 10 x the economics of </v>

1138
01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:18.170
<v Speaker 2>your business in the next three months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you do?</v>

1139
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.260
<v Speaker 2>And if their response is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's impossible.</v>

1140
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:24.680
<v Speaker 2>He responds with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't accept that answer.</v>

1141
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:27.500
<v Speaker 2>TrY again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1142
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.583
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to get unusual output and to find </v>

1143
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.980
<v Speaker 2>paths that are unique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are not well trodden,</v>

1144
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:41.000
<v Speaker 2>you have to ask better questions.</v>

1145
01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 2>So I'd saY that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very common.</v>

1146
01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.053
<v Speaker 2>More than 80 percent of the people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book also have some type of </v>

1147
01:01:45.801 --> 01:01:48.950
<v Speaker 2>mindfulness practice which could take </v>
<v Speaker 2>the form of meditation,</v>

1148
01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.550
<v Speaker 2>say using a guided meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one that came up a few times,</v>

1149
01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:54.170
<v Speaker 2>which is free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called the,</v>

1150
01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:59.300
<v Speaker 2>the 2010 summer smile meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is by tara brock.</v>

1151
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:00.163
<v Speaker 2>Super specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that one came up multiple times for </v>

1152
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:03.944
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or people using headspace in the </v>

1153
01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.573
<v Speaker 2>mornings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arnold schwartzenegger ended up using </v>

1154
01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:09.194
<v Speaker 2>transcendental meditation for a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>twice a day and then saw benefits for </v>

1155
01:02:12.021 --> 01:02:12.854
<v Speaker 2>decades afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really wild when you think </v>

1156
01:02:14.541 --> 01:02:15.520
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1157
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.530
<v Speaker 2>other commonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I asked almost all of the guests,</v>

1158
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.760
<v Speaker 2>what have you gifted most to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

1159
01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:21.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are certain books that popped up </v>

1160
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:25.110
<v Speaker 2>over and over again that are maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesser known,</v>

1161
01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:27.630
<v Speaker 2>like poor charlie's almanack by charlie </v>
<v Speaker 2>munger,</v>

1162
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:29.580
<v Speaker 2>who's warren buffet's right hand man.</v>

1163
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.850
<v Speaker 2>But who gets less of the media </v>
<v Speaker 2>spotlight?</v>

1164
01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Because I think he quite frankly hates </v>
<v Speaker 2>being in the spotlight.</v>

1165
01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:37.283
<v Speaker 2>He'S pretty cantankerous dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an Incredible book that came up </v>

1166
01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:42.870
<v Speaker 2>repeatedly with some of the wealthiest </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1167
01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:44.043
<v Speaker 2>A siddhartha by herman hesse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came up repeatedly by some of the best </v>

1168
01:02:48.901 --> 01:02:53.400
<v Speaker 2>musicians and investors go figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1169
01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:54.234
<v Speaker 2>So there are sapiens was another one </v>
<v Speaker 2>that came up across the board </v>

1170
01:02:58.170 --> 01:02:59.003
<v Speaker 2>repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are the types of things that </v>

1171
01:03:01.261 --> 01:03:03.060
<v Speaker 2>you spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some weird ones like,</v>

1172
01:03:03.061 --> 01:03:05.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>males over the age of say,</v>

1173
01:03:05.251 --> 01:03:09.420
<v Speaker 2>45,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very high percentage of them don't eat</v>

1174
01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:14.160
<v Speaker 2>breakfast at all or only eat one primary</v>
<v Speaker 2>meal per day,</v>

1175
01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.100
<v Speaker 2>usually early dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That came up a lot.</v>

1176
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.820
<v Speaker 2>So you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's totally conventional wisdom,</v>

1177
01:03:20.821 --> 01:03:21.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1178
01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:22.531
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1179
01:03:22.531 --> 01:03:23.364
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's for the most part runs completely </v>

1180
01:03:26.521 --> 01:03:27.354
<v Speaker 2>counter to conventional wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look into the scientific </v>

1181
01:03:29.521 --> 01:03:33.120
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've done a even for females,</v>

1182
01:03:33.121 --> 01:03:33.954
<v Speaker 2>it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it appears as though there's some data </v>

1183
01:03:36.121 --> 01:03:40.440
<v Speaker 2>to suggest that as you get older you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually consume protein,</v>

1184
01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:43.650
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better in a single large bolus,</v>

1185
01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:44.670
<v Speaker 2>a single large dose.</v>

1186
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:46.770
<v Speaker 2>So rather than having like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilder,</v>

1187
01:03:46.771 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 2>a meal every four hours or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1188
01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:51.660
<v Speaker 2>even three meals a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a 70 year old,</v>

1189
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.494
<v Speaker 2>80 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will actually consume your protein </v>

1190
01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:55.794
<v Speaker 2>more efficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the majority in one meal and go </v>

1191
01:03:59.521 --> 01:04:00.810
<v Speaker 2>figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems to,</v>

1192
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:01.673
<v Speaker 2>seems to correspond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a bunch of weird stuff like </v>

1193
01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:08.571
<v Speaker 2>that that pops up over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have any of these titans told,</v>

1194
01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:12.930
<v Speaker 2>knew something or given you some wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you tried to put into practice?</v>

1195
01:04:12.931 --> 01:04:14.190
<v Speaker 2>And then we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1196
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:17.790
<v Speaker 2>that does not work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1197
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:19.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1198
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.670
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

1199
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1200
01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:25.770
<v Speaker 2>and the good news is for every pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's someone who will let you off the</v>

1201
01:04:25.771 --> 01:04:26.530
<v Speaker 2>hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1202
01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the good news.</v>

1203
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:30.950
<v Speaker 2>So you can really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the objective is,</v>

1204
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:35.250
<v Speaker 2>is to create your own bespoke toolkit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1205
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:36.563
<v Speaker 2>And for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people who wake up </v>

1206
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:40.740
<v Speaker 2>very early.</v>

1207
01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.020
<v Speaker 2>You have people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amelia boone,</v>

1208
01:04:43.021 --> 01:04:45.480
<v Speaker 2>who is this incredible super athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jocko willink,</v>

1209
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:48.360
<v Speaker 2>a long list of folks who wake up at say </v>
<v Speaker 2>4:30</v>

1210
01:04:48.361 --> 01:04:51.180
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've tried that,</v>

1211
01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:54.030
<v Speaker 2>but I'm much better going to bed around </v>
<v Speaker 2>4:30</v>

1212
01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:57.930
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would lean more towards say,</v>

1213
01:04:57.931 --> 01:04:59.540
<v Speaker 2>the bj novak said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1214
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:04.610
<v Speaker 2>writers and comedians and so on who </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even really hit their groove until</v>

1215
01:05:05.221 --> 01:05:06.054
<v Speaker 2>11:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM.</v>

1216
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:07.770
<v Speaker 2>That's more my speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1217
01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:10.320
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the waking up with the amish,</v>

1218
01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:11.770
<v Speaker 2>not my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1219
01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really make that work for me.</v>

1220
01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not anytime soon.</v>

1221
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:18.430
<v Speaker 2>So do you think some of this is just how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hardwired</v>

1222
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>versus how you can actually learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>train yourself?</v>

1223
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Like something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would guess that knowing you,</v>

1224
01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>you could probably overcome that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put enough time into it.</v>

1225
01:05:28.631 --> 01:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>You may not feel that that's worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting time into,</v>

1226
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:32.703
<v Speaker 1>but how much is that battle between just</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you're hardwired in nature </v>

1227
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>versus the desire to change yourself?</v>

1228
01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you've,</v>

1229
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.013
<v Speaker 2>I think you can see the good news is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything in tools of titans is </v>

1230
01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:47.900
<v Speaker 2>intended to be a one day or one week </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment,</v>

1231
01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can try it.</v>

1232
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:52.430
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Bruce Lee said,</v>

1233
01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.810
<v Speaker 2>something along these lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1234
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:55.520
<v Speaker 2>except what is useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reject,</v>

1235
01:05:55.521 --> 01:05:57.410
<v Speaker 2>what is useless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>add what is uniquely your own.</v>

1236
01:05:57.411 --> 01:06:02.411
<v Speaker 2>So I've tried to do the morning thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just better,</v>

1237
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:05.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to bed late and waking up late and</v>

1238
01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:06.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1239
01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've accepted that.</v>

1240
01:06:08.451 --> 01:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't beat myself up over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1241
01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.170
<v Speaker 2>there is definitely a hard wiring </v>
<v Speaker 2>component.</v>

1242
01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.004
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people need only three hours of </v>

1243
01:06:17.661 --> 01:06:19.910
<v Speaker 2>sleep per night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a bunch of these mutants,</v>

1244
01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:21.253
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of people will do best</v>
<v Speaker 2>on say seven and a half to 10 hours of </v>

1245
01:06:24.711 --> 01:06:25.544
<v Speaker 2>sleep per night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say maybe 30 percent of the </v>

1246
01:06:28.941 --> 01:06:31.190
<v Speaker 2>people I've spoken to that I've talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>to about this,</v>

1247
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:36.430
<v Speaker 2>we'll try to get some type of short nap </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the say mid afternoon between 2:30</v>

1248
01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.260
<v Speaker 2>and 4:00.</v>

1249
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:40.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1250
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:43.750
<v Speaker 2>there are certain personalized elements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1251
01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:46.640
<v Speaker 2>that are dependent on your genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>makeup or at least,</v>

1252
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:49.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced by your genetic makeup.</v>

1253
01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:49.993
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in reality is more negotiable than I </v>

1254
01:06:51.771 --> 01:06:53.960
<v Speaker 2>think people realize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even that stuff,</v>

1255
01:06:53.961 --> 01:06:56.510
<v Speaker 2>you can override it if you want to for </v>
<v Speaker 2>periods of time,</v>

1256
01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:57.843
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use something like polyphasic </v>

1257
01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:02.970
<v Speaker 2>sleep and combine that with something </v>
<v Speaker 2>called exoticness ketones.</v>

1258
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:03.843
<v Speaker 2>IT's powdered form of alternate energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically you combine those two things </v>

1259
01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:08.334
<v Speaker 2>that you could probably do like two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two and half hours of sleep per day for </v>

1260
01:07:12.171 --> 01:07:16.430
<v Speaker 2>a few weeks at a time and I've done that</v>
<v Speaker 2>before in dire situations,</v>

1261
01:07:16.431 --> 01:07:19.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something you want to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sustain</v>

1262
01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.930
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1263
01:07:20.931 --> 01:07:21.764
<v Speaker 1>I should've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've talked to you about a month </v>

1264
01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.190
<v Speaker 1>ago because I couldn't use it with bud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1265
01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to end this with the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>softball question of all time.</v>

1266
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:33.560
<v Speaker 1>If you had one book that you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to go out and read right now,</v>

1267
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>go out and buy a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1268
01:07:36.231 --> 01:07:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Digital hard copy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

1269
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:40.220
<v Speaker 1>What book would that be?</v>

1270
01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to recommend not biased.</v>

1271
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:45.303
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to recommend tools of </v>

1272
01:07:46.221 --> 01:07:51.221
<v Speaker 2>titans because this is the first book I </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed writing and it is the first book</v>

1273
01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:58.720
<v Speaker 2>that I have since writing re-read </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple times because the,</v>

1274
01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:02.300
<v Speaker 2>the tools and tactics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommendations are not just mine.</v>

1275
01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:03.163
<v Speaker 2>It's not me listening to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the best practices of 200 world </v>

1276
01:08:06.741 --> 01:08:10.580
<v Speaker 2>class performance from every possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline you can imagine.</v>

1277
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:13.520
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as of right now on amazon,</v>

1278
01:08:13.521 --> 01:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>I think it has 410 reviews straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a five star average.</v>

1279
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:20.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like 87 percent have given it five </v>
<v Speaker 2>stars.</v>

1280
01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1281
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:23.460
<v Speaker 2>I know you're refreshing as we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

1282
01:08:23.461 --> 01:08:25.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm come on now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1283
01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:26.870
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the compulsive amazon check.</v>

1284
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>

1285
01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.660
<v Speaker 2>there's no author.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1286
01:08:29.661 --> 01:08:31.010
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say no other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no other.</v>

1287
01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I know who is immune to that during </v>
<v Speaker 2>launch week for sure.</v>

1288
01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:36.470
<v Speaker 2>You having that level of peace yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1289
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.620
<v Speaker 2>have high level nothing yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1290
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.060
<v Speaker 2>During launch week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1291
01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Every author is just like a rat with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine pellet dispenser checking amazon</v>

1292
01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.590
<v Speaker 2>if we're being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1293
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.290
<v Speaker 2>tools of titans is what I'd recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1294
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:49.183

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1295
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:53.390

1297
01:08:57.321 --> 01:09:01.010
<v Speaker 2>and it's really intended so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit down with a cup of tea or coffee and</v>

1298
01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 2>get a chapter in that period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the time you finished that cub.</v>

1299
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:09.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
