00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is an author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the editorial director of the American </v>

2
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Institute for Economic Research as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a senior fellow at the Austrian </v>

3
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>economic center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Tucker.</v>

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Good to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost wore the same bow tie my </v>

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I should've brought one extra for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been working on this.</v>

8
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton I want to talk to you.</v>

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sort of a one of these people </v>

10
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.001
<v Speaker 1>that are right around all of the topics </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm talking about from freedom and </v>

11
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.661
<v Speaker 1>liberty and free speech and the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the left and the right and all </v>

12
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:44.191
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your new book and I want to get the </v>

13
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>title absolutely correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right wing collectivism.</v>

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>The other threat to liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that would be the spot for us </v>

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.580
<v Speaker 1>to kick this off because most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people watching this show know that I've</v>

16
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>mostly focused on the left.</v>

17
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

18
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Was My home or was it progressive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've woken up to it.</v>

19
00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real liberalism is obviously,</v>

20
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>and that has nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern left,</v>

21
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

22
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't critique the right enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's dive in.</v>

23
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that so often the left and the right </v>

24
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>are not as distinguishable as they seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be for,</v>

25
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

27
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>this trade stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth Warren and Donald trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically agreed.</v>

29
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>How do you account for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now we use all the celebration of </v>

30
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the working classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>the trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian Wright a green with a Bernie Sanders</v>

33
00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that,</v>

34
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left is evermore trending </v>

35
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>nationalist and its immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>

36
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't use to be the case.</v>

37
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>So how is the left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Bernie Sanders complained that free</v>

39
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>free immigration is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a coke or coke industries plot </v>

40
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.080
<v Speaker 1>basically to provide the capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>class cheaper workers for example,</v>

41
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>now that you would have never found </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody on the left 20 years ago saying </v>

42
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

43
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>but now you know what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

45
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

46
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.690
<v Speaker 1>the hatred of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

47
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>of commerce.</v>

48
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the merchant class is so intense now</v>

49
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>that if a luxury resort in in Florida </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to hire some,</v>

50
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 1>some immigrants to work for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the left is saying,</v>

51
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.490
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

52
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.180
<v Speaker 1>this is terrible because his capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism at work.</v>

53
00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>So he was trying to see the strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>blending.</v>

54
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>The left and the right have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural pitches,</v>

55
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.610
<v Speaker 1>a different appeals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different constituencies,</v>

56
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.460
<v Speaker 1>but they both have this agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

57
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.590
<v Speaker 1>That boils down to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the use of power.</v>

58
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Is this a little bit of just what people</v>
<v Speaker 1>refer to as the horseshoe theory,</v>

59
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>that the more that the sides had become </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of extreme,</v>

60
00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:44.590
<v Speaker 1>that they're oddly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've heard this,</v>

61
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:49.591
<v Speaker 1>this horseshoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to think that's a little bit </v>

62
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:51.421
<v Speaker 1>superficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I look at it a little bit more </v>

63
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.011
<v Speaker 1>historically and you see since since </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism was born in the world in the </v>

64
00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 1>18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really high middle ages,</v>

65
00:02:55.601 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>but when the revolt against liberalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>began the early 19th century,</v>

66
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Too much change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much wealth.</v>

68
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>The wrong people are getting rich and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough control.</v>

69
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>What are we gonna do about our religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our language,</v>

70
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>our rates?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:14.911
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolt began to grow from about the </v>

72
00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:17.101
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 isn't and intensified and spread to </v>

73
00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:21.721
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain really began to take root and </v>

74
00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:22.910
<v Speaker 1>continental Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There took two forms.</v>

75
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>There was a left forearm and a right </v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

76
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>and in each country they took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took on different generations,</v>

77
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>different names he knows so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Britain you had the Tories,</v>

78
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:37.381
<v Speaker 1>then you had the Labor Labor Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both wanted to use the state for </v>

79
00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:40.471
<v Speaker 1>their own purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you always had the opposition </v>

80
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:40.471
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the liberals,</v>

81
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:41.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

82
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>and that's the way it's fleshed out </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

83
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>In country after country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Liberal Party has always been.</v>

84
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>The people said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just let society be,</v>

85
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 1>let people live their lives.</v>

86
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Let them choose a religion of their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have their own choice.</v>

87
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>If they don't hurt anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a problem.</v>

88
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Let's have free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This have a universal rights as have </v>

89
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>rights for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of slavery.</v>

90
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:07.321
<v Speaker 1>Let's have rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The acknowledged the existence of </v>

91
00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>women's rights or equality of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>for everybody.</v>

92
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Leave everybody alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the liberal position.</v>

93
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty good position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>

94
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful position and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's what I favorites,</v>

95
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:21.811
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's what built civilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of the religious wars of the </v>

96
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>high middle ages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We discovered this idea of freedom.</v>

97
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>We tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it worked,</v>

98
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>but there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's always been a revolt brewing</v>

99
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a resentment,</v>

100
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 1>resentment against it or get resentment </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the commercial class.</v>

101
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Too much change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much wealth,</v>

102
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People getting wealthy.</v>

103
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>We're not controlling demographics well </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

104
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the thing is,</v>

105
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.970
<v Speaker 1>it takes different forms in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries and in different times in </v>

106
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 1>different places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately the right and the left or</v>

107
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.080
<v Speaker 1>ideologies of control and power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism has always been the </v>

108
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>alternative to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

109
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>So we keep having to rediscover this </v>
<v Speaker 1>again and again and every generation.</v>

110
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

111
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.620
<v Speaker 2>well that's why now I'm so happy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

112
00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:07.170
<v Speaker 2>as you said to me right before we </v>
<v Speaker 2>started the phrase,</v>

113
00:05:07.171 --> 00:05:10.680
<v Speaker 2>classical liberalism is coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

114
00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:15.681
<v Speaker 2>You hear it on tv every now and again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to think that maybe I had a </v>

115
00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 2>little something to do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.230
<v Speaker 2>and to me it is the only current </v>
<v Speaker 2>antidote to the problems that we have,</v>

117
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:28.701
<v Speaker 2>either the the more state power that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic socialist want as they've </v>

118
00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:33.081
<v Speaker 2>sort of ransacked their own party and </v>
<v Speaker 2>purged all of the Liberals and it's also</v>

119
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:38.271
<v Speaker 2>the antidote for all of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think trump is all of the </v>

120
00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:38.340
<v Speaker 2>horrible things that people say about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them all the time,</v>

121
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.550
<v Speaker 2>what's the antidote?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The antidote isn't to get somebody else </v>

122
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.011
<v Speaker 2>and then more power to power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The antidote obviously is to take power </v>

123
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 2>away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what liberalism,</v>

124
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>my hope is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are the good people left the </v>

125
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.331
<v Speaker 1>center of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're looking at the emergence of </v>

126
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:58.151
<v Speaker 1>the trump problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll reconsider a the uses of power and</v>

127
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:04.661
<v Speaker 1>the executive state and why did we build</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gigantic machinery of the total </v>

128
00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 1>state if it's so vulnerable to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>captured by our enemies.</v>

129
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

130
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the real question that we're at </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

131
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:16.421
<v Speaker 1>If you believe this thing has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>captured by the Russians or whatever it </v>

132
00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:16.421
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

133
00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:17.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

134
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of answering your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

135
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.040
<v Speaker 1>I hope that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can rekindle a kind of a new </v>

136
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>resurgence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do have to credit you and Jordan </v>

137
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Peterson for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

138
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.181
<v Speaker 1>I've been working at it for about 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years to try to bring back to the,</v>

139
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.880
<v Speaker 1>not just the term liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the concept of liberalism to,</v>

140
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 1>to public life and a bit.</v>

141
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>It's been difficult because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

142
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>because we do have the state that </v>
<v Speaker 1>creates a kind of moral and intellectual</v>

143
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 1>and ideological hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebodies got to control it.</v>

144
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 1>And now that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we built it over the last hundred years,</v>

145
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.030
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

146
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>this total state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive taxes,</v>

147
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interventions,</v>

148
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running people's lives.</v>

149
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's trying to get hold of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab it and beat up their enemies.</v>

150
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious problem.</v>

151
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:12.731
<v Speaker 1>So when people say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've discussed this on the show a </v>

152
00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:14.951
<v Speaker 1>bunch of times before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've addressed this in several </v>

153
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:14.951
<v Speaker 1>forums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people say to me,</v>

154
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:14.951
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

155
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>when you say you're a classical liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>in youtube about laissez faire economics</v>

156
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>and getting the government out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and all those things,</v>

157
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.740
<v Speaker 1>really this is just a repackaged </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism or you're just afraid to </v>

158
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.391
<v Speaker 1>say that you're a conservative because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still not cool or something like </v>

159
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:28.391
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

160
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>How would you define the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

161
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:32.160
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a classical liberal and a libertarian?</v>

162
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about that because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

163
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.810
<v Speaker 1>because after World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.190
<v Speaker 1>these new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these new terms came along,</v>

165
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one was conservatism.</v>

166
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:44.710
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really used before the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 fifties,</v>

167
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Russell Kirk's book called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

168
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.750
<v Speaker 1>the mindset of a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply like the conservative mind,</v>

169
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it was what it was called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Libertarianism was again a first </v>

170
00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:01.020
<v Speaker 1>used it about 1957.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

171
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 1>by the translator of the works of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Basquiat.</v>

172
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:10.390
<v Speaker 1>The problem was the term liberal had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been captured by the new dealers as </v>

173
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:15.701
<v Speaker 1>early as 1933.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they acquiesced to the idea of the </v>

174
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:19.100
<v Speaker 1>corporate of estate and we're blaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great depression on capitalism,</v>

175
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that became a problem for liberalism </v>

176
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.821
<v Speaker 1>that kept the term liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were no longer liberal because </v>

177
00:08:27.821 --> 00:08:31.900
<v Speaker 1>they were suddenly for big government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were four big government and even </v>

178
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:31.900
<v Speaker 1>worse the corporate state.</v>

179
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.500
<v Speaker 1>And actually we can just be more blunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and say that back in the 1930,</v>

180
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:37.030
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

181
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.370
<v Speaker 1>this ideology had a name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The name is fascist.</v>

182
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

183
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 1>so the caved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

184
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the New York Times in 1933,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times magazine was </v>

185
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.081
<v Speaker 1>celebrating the great prep professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mussolini and how he and FDR shared a </v>

186
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>vision for the planned economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the world we're living in back</v>

187
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:57.770
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

188
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 1>we lost the term liberal after World War</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>

189
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:04.590
<v Speaker 1>There was an attempt to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just speak a language,</v>

190
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:10.070
<v Speaker 1>to describe who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on one hand you had this new thing </v>

191
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.280
<v Speaker 1>called conservatism and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

192
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 1>they kind of sampled some of this Tori </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tori,</v>

193
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:19.551
<v Speaker 1>like nostalgia for the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of revanchist let's </v>

194
00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:20.530
<v Speaker 1>recapture what we've lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you,</v>

195
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.540
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had the genuine liberals and they </v>

196
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.000
<v Speaker 1>coined the term libertarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had been sitting on the shelf </v>

197
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 1>since the late 19th century.</v>

198
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Now most of the people who call </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves libertarians in the late 19th</v>

199
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America and England were anarchists,</v>

200
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:40.161
<v Speaker 1>socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody had bothered with the term </v>

201
00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 1>for decades and decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Dean Russell said,</v>

202
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's using that word.</v>

203
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we use it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was closer to the truth of what</v>

204
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>they were in effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.940
<v Speaker 1>what was interesting about that is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>dean rustled described it in his 1957 </v>

206
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:58.161
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a synonym for what was once </v>

207
00:09:58.161 --> 00:10:01.761
<v Speaker 1>called liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't think it was a tweak or an </v>

208
00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:05.301
<v Speaker 1>improvement or a distillation or </v>
<v Speaker 1>refinement or a new dogmatic way of </v>

209
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>describing liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was liberalism.</v>

210
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.930
<v Speaker 1>So I need to read that because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I feel.</v>

211
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone sends me,</v>

212
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a libertarian.</v>

213
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we need labels,</v>

214
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind that late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind the idea.</v>

215
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can split the difference on how much </v>

216
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:23.770
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

217
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.840
<v Speaker 1>she'd be the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think libertarianism as a number,</v>

218
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 1>as a term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a number of problems.</v>

219
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:31.281
<v Speaker 1>One is it's a little clinical sounding </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has too many syllables and it </v>

220
00:10:31.281 --> 00:10:34.581
<v Speaker 1>makes you sound a little bit awkward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds maybe a little too canonical.</v>

221
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>

222
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.820
<v Speaker 1>we have a list of things you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe,</v>

223
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

224
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

225
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>it's all rooted in this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reductionist.</v>

226
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.960
<v Speaker 1>A more commonly these days is rooted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of in a reductionist,</v>

227
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:52.970
<v Speaker 1>nonaggression principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a fine principles or rule of </v>

228
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.970
<v Speaker 1>thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a good.</v>

229
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't describe the whole of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other problem is that </v>

230
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.410
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a new term,</v>

231
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't have a deep history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can't look back and say,</v>

232
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 1>oh look.</v>

233
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:09.530
<v Speaker 1>The Libertarians freed the slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the libertarians a acknowledged to the </v>

234
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 1>rights of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Libertarians gave us,</v>

235
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:16.551
<v Speaker 1>the commercial society that built the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class and brought dignity to the </v>

236
00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.480
<v Speaker 1>average person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they had existed as a party,</v>

237
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:20.170
<v Speaker 1>they would have done those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would have done this.</v>

238
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means the liberals,</v>

239
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's deliberate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We changed our name so now we can like,</v>

240
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.380
<v Speaker 1>feel a sense of pride in our past so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a past.</v>

241
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're at.</v>

242
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians tend to be detached from </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own history for that reason.</v>

243
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.810
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a word problem.</v>

244
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:42.110
<v Speaker 1>The second problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism doesn't have a universal </v>

245
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 1>of usage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whereas liberalism does,</v>

246
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 1>you can go to Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe yourself and liberal Brazil.</v>

247
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:48.630
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's liberals in Germany,</v>

248
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:53.631
<v Speaker 1>there's liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a word for liberalism and every </v>

249
00:11:53.631 --> 00:11:56.661
<v Speaker 1>language and it more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less means the same thing except in the </v>

250
00:11:56.661 --> 00:11:56.661
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

251
00:11:56.661 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

252
00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

253
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we acquiesced to this term </v>

254
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.000
<v Speaker 1>libertarian and just wipe out our </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal history,</v>

255
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.310
<v Speaker 1>we're cutting off cells off both from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and from our own history.</v>

256
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because you've just said </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in a far better way than I think I've</v>

257
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 1>ever really laid it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people will say to me,</v>

258
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop saying you're a liberal and I don't</v>

259
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 1>want to stop saying I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fighting an uphill battle right now.</v>

260
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

261
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm a salmon swimming upstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be tough,</v>

262
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to deny what is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth just because,</v>

263
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 1>because it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's who you are and you want to,</v>

264
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 1>you want to have an ancestry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

265
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 1>you want to look back and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see,</v>

266
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

267
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:41.290
<v Speaker 1>the champions are the medic cheese in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 15th century,</v>

268
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Florence and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know those people.</v>

269
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Those are my people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

270
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.980
<v Speaker 1>the people who long for a world without </v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>

271
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the early 19th century,</v>

272
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 1>the people who wanted free trading </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought hard for it.</v>

273
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Those are our people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our history.</v>

274
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

275
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.440
<v Speaker 1>we were born as part of a long stream of</v>
<v Speaker 1>emancipation that's been taking place </v>

276
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 1>for 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our movement,</v>

277
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 1>our people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our history.</v>

278
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Let's embrace it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with your brother.</v>

279
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

280
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.150
<v Speaker 1>So are there any of those liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of the Democratic Party anymore?</v>

281
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Do those people exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's strange?</v>

282
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Things are happening on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strange thing.</v>

283
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I should pause you for one </v>
<v Speaker 2>sec.</v>

284
00:13:24.651 --> 00:13:27.110
<v Speaker 2>I my original question here because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do the deep dive on that.</v>

285
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to get.</v>

286
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:29.470
<v Speaker 2>We will get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

287
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I promise you we're going to get to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>topic.</v>

288
00:13:31.951 --> 00:13:36.951
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deep dive of the far right gets us </v>

289
00:13:36.951 --> 00:13:36.951
<v Speaker 2>into a very dark place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

290
00:13:36.951 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Speaker 2>well maybe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

291
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.780
<v Speaker 2>so maybe the whole second half will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that,</v>

292
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.180
<v Speaker 2>but we just put that out there right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

293
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:45.181
<v Speaker 2>That's what we'll do for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just now getting out of my </v>

294
00:13:45.181 --> 00:13:45.181
<v Speaker 2>depression having been a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>

295
00:13:45.181 --> 00:13:49.940
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so our whole second half is going to be </v>

296
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:49.940
<v Speaker 2>what my first question was about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just keep going.</v>

297
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

298
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would for now.</v>

299
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:55.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so strange things have happened to the </v>

300
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.140
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

301
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just mention that the phrase </v>

302
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.540
<v Speaker 1>cultural appropriation for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when,</v>

303
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.840
<v Speaker 1>when did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the approbation of this idea of cultural</v>

304
00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:05.640
<v Speaker 1>appropriation can put two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years ago,</v>

305
00:14:05.641 --> 00:14:06.150
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

306
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:06.930
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

307
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.060
<v Speaker 1>academia is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may have been brewing for 10 years,</v>

308
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.780
<v Speaker 1>but when I first heard about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that is the craziest bunch of </v>

309
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.950
<v Speaker 1>nonsense I've ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

310
00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:20.180
<v Speaker 1>civilization is nothing but cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriation.</v>

311
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.750
<v Speaker 1>We've been doing this since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the 19th century.</v>

312
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

313
00:14:25.321 --> 00:14:30.321
<v Speaker 1>at the height of the competency and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain where Judaism and Islam and </v>

314
00:14:31.021 --> 00:14:36.021
<v Speaker 1>Christianity came together in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful melting pot where we all learn</v>

315
00:14:36.331 --> 00:14:41.331
<v Speaker 1>from each other and the cultures began </v>
<v Speaker 1>to blend and our religions began to </v>

316
00:14:41.331 --> 00:14:41.331
<v Speaker 1>change at our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

317
00:14:41.331 --> 00:14:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll look on life began to because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned from each other.</v>

318
00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:46.020
<v Speaker 1>If we stay isolated in our little </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes,</v>

319
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.320
<v Speaker 1>we're never going to progress and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that,</v>

320
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if it was inadvertent </v>
<v Speaker 1>or what happened,</v>

321
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.330
<v Speaker 1>but we can talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

322
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.470
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when suddenly you're told you cannot </v>

323
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.291
<v Speaker 1>have affection for another culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take what you find valuable and,</v>

324
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:07.350
<v Speaker 1>and learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn for yourself and live a better </v>

325
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.350
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

326
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.570
<v Speaker 1>That is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to think it's cultural </v>

327
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 1>annihilation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not cultural appropriation,</v>

328
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they seem to be.</v>

329
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.970
<v Speaker 1>This is something that will lead to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction of that culture when in fact</v>

330
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 1>it actually spreads the ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

331
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:22.250
<v Speaker 1>the foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing,</v>

332
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

333
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.910
<v Speaker 1>the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just creating culture as a scarce </v>

334
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 1>good like it's a property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the magic of culture,</v>

335
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.500
<v Speaker 1>which is the same magic of ideas is </v>
<v Speaker 1>resides in its infinite reproducibility </v>

336
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.980
<v Speaker 1>and its malleability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that the world of </v>

337
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:42.710
<v Speaker 1>ideas can do that the physical world </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot do,</v>

338
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 1>and if we don't make that distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get very confused.</v>

339
00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emily?</v>

340
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Cultures Spread and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're infinite and they can constantly</v>

341
00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:57.660
<v Speaker 1>change and that's the magic and beauty </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

342
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.440
<v Speaker 1>of culture and we can't get that out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this glass of water,</v>

343
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:01.900
<v Speaker 1>this table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

344
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:02.240
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

345
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.580
<v Speaker 1>they're bound by the constraints of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scarcity.</v>

346
00:16:04.581 --> 00:16:06.920
<v Speaker 1>But the world of ideas is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's magical.</v>

347
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:08.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like a constant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant,</v>

348
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.740
<v Speaker 1>infinite sandstorm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

349
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.350
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm constantly changing and we can,</v>

350
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:20.650
<v Speaker 1>we can take a culture for ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>without taking it from somebody else.</v>

351
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

352
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.460
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

353
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 1>it's reproductive reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's infinite reproduction.</v>

354
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:31.121
<v Speaker 1>So loaves and the fishes isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the beauty to that America has </v>

355
00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 1>done this better than anyone perhaps in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of the world.</v>

356
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.170
<v Speaker 1>You just referenced some other points in</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

357
00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:41.150
<v Speaker 1>but that we have taken in more cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you said the phrase melting pot.</v>

358
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we designed and set up here,</v>

359
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.660
<v Speaker 1>the most beautiful melting pot ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in New York City for most of my </v>

360
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.480
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my adult life at least,</v>

361
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.630
<v Speaker 1>and would be on subway cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you are on that car with absolutely </v>

362
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.510
<v Speaker 1>everyone with have white guys with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreadlocks and the whole thing.</v>

363
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:05.410
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not like everybody and you may </v>

364
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:05.410
<v Speaker 1>not like the way this guy smells and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person may be doing this,</v>

365
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.780
<v Speaker 1>but we're all there living together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's magic.</v>

366
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

367
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

368
00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:17.081
<v Speaker 1>it's commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because this country elevated the </v>

369
00:17:17.081 --> 00:17:20.450
<v Speaker 1>commercial ethos to be the highest thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that great and no bling factor of,</v>

370
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.200
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

371
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.280
<v Speaker 1>of human life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's commerce that brings people </v>

372
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:26.280
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we experienced that every day.</v>

373
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:26.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

374
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.710
<v Speaker 1>in a commercial setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

375
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.980
<v Speaker 1>people aren't fighting each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting along.</v>

376
00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find I'm with you.</v>

377
00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to a restaurant and I get served by</v>

378
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.230
<v Speaker 1>some guy from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from uh,</v>

379
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a chance to meet somebody new.</v>

380
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:46.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a chance to engage somebody and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a personal relationship with </v>

381
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's serving you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>serving them.</v>

382
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And you experienced this magic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange.</v>

383
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.510
<v Speaker 1>A Benjamin consultant used to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and the and the 18 thirties,</v>

384
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

385
00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:01.140
<v Speaker 1>how commerce brought to the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>new understanding of freedom and a new </v>

386
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for us to find value in each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

387
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.650
<v Speaker 1>in service of each other and see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And America just flourished in commerce.</v>

388
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have,</v>

389
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diversity and the end.</v>

390
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:19.320
<v Speaker 1>This melting pot they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this rich cultural life.</v>

391
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny because I'm so keenly </v>

392
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.161
<v Speaker 2>aware of it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only because of the conversations </v>

393
00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm having and because people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming about this stuff all the time,</v>

394
00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.040
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on this tour with Jordan Peterson </v>

395
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.040
<v Speaker 2>and when I go to every airport that I go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

396
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.620
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 percent of the time,</v>

397
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 2>unless someone's had a car for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take an uber and I just happened </v>

398
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.730
<v Speaker 2>whatever rubric and there is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is every single type of person </v>

399
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.530
<v Speaker 2>that looks every which way color every </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality.</v>

400
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 2>And usually I talk a little bit to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them it's,</v>

401
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

402
00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:50.470
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are just people,</v>

403
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm maybe for the same way,</v>

404
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in Atlanta,</v>

405
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:56.650
<v Speaker 2>which is just a gigantic really diverse </v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

406
00:18:56.651 --> 00:19:01.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everywhere you go you're bumping </v>

407
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:01.651
<v Speaker 2>into people who are different from you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

408
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:02.860
<v Speaker 2>and hang around and crypto circles in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlanta.</v>

409
00:19:02.861 --> 00:19:06.190
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to you and that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about a melting pot.</v>

410
00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're all together and there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all consider each other are people,</v>

411
00:19:09.971 --> 00:19:14.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because we all love crypto and it </v>

412
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:14.971
<v Speaker 2>has nothing to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with race.</v>

413
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:16.490
<v Speaker 2>You can appreciate racial differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

414
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.770
<v Speaker 1>but also see value in everybody and hope</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can see value in you.</v>

415
00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:27.111
<v Speaker 1>You can come together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that we have to be </v>

416
00:19:27.111 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or denied differences.</v>

417
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:33.000
<v Speaker 1>It means that we find strength and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>heterogeneity and,</v>

418
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes for a beautiful and exciting </v>

419
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the strangest things that's </v>

420
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.671
<v Speaker 1>happening now with the rise of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outright in response to the failures and</v>

421
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.910
<v Speaker 1>strange and so the left is this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebration of homogeneity as if,</v>

422
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:54.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to live in a unitary racial </v>

423
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.110
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

424
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.830
<v Speaker 1>where we all speak the same language are</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the same religion.</v>

425
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.640
<v Speaker 1>So that strikes me as this theoretically</v>
<v Speaker 1>very boring and I don't,</v>

426
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't even recognize what that world </v>
<v Speaker 1>would look like and feel like and it </v>

427
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Speaker 1>doesn't appeal to me in the slightest </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

428
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My nerdy.</v>

429
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.960
<v Speaker 1>It was built out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the diversity that grows out of </v>

430
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.900
<v Speaker 1>commerce and the commerce is the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what helps us invest in </v>

431
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.620
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

432
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Adam Smith said this about the division </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Labor,</v>

433
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what causes wealth?</v>

434
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.890
<v Speaker 1>The division of Labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big can that be?</v>

435
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:26.220
<v Speaker 1>It should be as big as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wider the division of Labor,</v>

436
00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:31.221
<v Speaker 1>the more people you include in the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>project of of building commercial life </v>

437
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:37.070
<v Speaker 1>and production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wealthier we're all going to be </v>

438
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.980
<v Speaker 1>together and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that vision.</v>

439
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:38.970
<v Speaker 1>So when</v>

440
00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:40.910
<v Speaker 2>we talk about capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

441
00:20:40.911 --> 00:20:45.911
<v Speaker 2>they show I'll every now and again I </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped in the comment section or I see </v>

442
00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:45.911
<v Speaker 2>what people say on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I have,</v>

443
00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:50.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the Iran on or just some of the </v>

444
00:20:50.581 --> 00:20:50.581
<v Speaker 2>people</v>

445
00:20:50.581 --> 00:20:52.980
<v Speaker 1>that are not for regulation at all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just let the economy go and see what </v>

446
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.821
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a certain amount of </v>

447
00:20:56.821 --> 00:20:56.821
<v Speaker 1>people that say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

448
00:20:56.821 --> 00:20:59.311
<v Speaker 1>that all sounds well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the rich keep getting richer </v>

449
00:20:59.311 --> 00:21:00.940
<v Speaker 1>and the poor keep getting poorer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos shouldn't have,</v>

450
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$20,000,000,000,000</v>

451
00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 1>or whatever he has right now are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of it.</v>

452
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.020
<v Speaker 1>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the boiler plate answer to why </v>

453
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:10.630
<v Speaker 1>you eventually end up with those kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliche.</v>

454
00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:15.631
<v Speaker 1>It's because they've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been around for 150 years and </v>

455
00:21:15.631 --> 00:21:18.061
<v Speaker 1>they've never been true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that they weren't true and </v>

456
00:21:18.061 --> 00:21:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Marxists time and everybody quickly </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that going to by the late 19th</v>

457
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.820
<v Speaker 1>century in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

458
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.480
<v Speaker 1>we had built the most prosperous economy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world by far,</v>

459
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:28.330
<v Speaker 1>by far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by far growing incomes,</v>

460
00:21:28.331 --> 00:21:30.430
<v Speaker 1>longer lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthier people,</v>

461
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 1>more opportunities for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are moving to the cities.</v>

462
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's benefiting from capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been going on for such a long </v>

463
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.181
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet here we are in 2018 and we're still </v>

464
00:21:42.181 --> 00:21:43.630
<v Speaker 1>recycling these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these Victorian era cliche.</v>

465
00:21:43.631 --> 00:21:45.570
<v Speaker 1>It's about capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

466
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:50.670
<v Speaker 1>What do you think capitalism then </v>
<v Speaker 1>screwed up if if only just a marketing </v>

467
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.840
<v Speaker 1>piece of it or something where right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sent and I believe that it will not </v>

468
00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:00.020
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It somehow doesn't seem cool to be for </v>

469
00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:00.100
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least with the.</v>

470
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.880
<v Speaker 1>He does seem to be the the change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's in the name and I.</v>

471
00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have a problem not using </v>
<v Speaker 1>the word capitalism.</v>

472
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean I will probably have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>view towards this.</v>

473
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:15.571
<v Speaker 1>I will speak the language that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and if I want to rebrand </v>

474
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.610
<v Speaker 1>capitalism as liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it probably should be actually </v>

475
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:20.610
<v Speaker 1>liberal liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm,</v>

476
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same time.</v>

477
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I kinda liked the term capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem with capital because,</v>

478
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.660
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really does underscore really </v>

479
00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.610
<v Speaker 1>important point that without private </v>
<v Speaker 1>property and the in the and ownership of</v>

480
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:38.611
<v Speaker 1>the means of production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have a complex production </v>

481
00:22:38.611 --> 00:22:40.090
<v Speaker 1>structures and you can't hire more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

482
00:22:40.091 --> 00:22:42.550
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't build great things.</v>

483
00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 1>You can have great cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't improve people's lives.</v>

484
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.740
<v Speaker 1>So what are the things that you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>government should do?</v>

485
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of lots of clans rules that we </v>

486
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 1>should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

487
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.570
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a fan of governments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

488
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 1>If there was some way that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

489
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old fashioned the state,</v>

490
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was really minded,</v>

491
00:23:06.371 --> 00:23:11.371
<v Speaker 1>his own business and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept kept civil war from happening,</v>

492
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

493
00:23:13.301 --> 00:23:15.760
<v Speaker 1>kept conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of mass conflict.</v>

494
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that would be a probably a good,</v>

495
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.780
<v Speaker 1>a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

496
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 1>state is not very good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

497
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:23.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

498
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've got,</v>

499
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I've got the mind of an addict because </v>
<v Speaker 1>to essentially I trust,</v>

500
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I trust the chaos of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of spontaneous human action much more </v>

501
00:23:34.961 --> 00:23:36.580
<v Speaker 1>than any kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

502
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.520
<v Speaker 1>of imposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

503
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.060
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm at same time,</v>

504
00:23:40.061 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I do like the writings of the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals,</v>

505
00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:42.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

506
00:23:42.391 --> 00:23:47.391
<v Speaker 1>they imagine that the state should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to keep something like order </v>

507
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:49.800
<v Speaker 1>in life to keep civil war from </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

508
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.590
<v Speaker 1>to keep people from killing each other.</v>

509
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.040
<v Speaker 1>A terrible things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But beyond that state should just,</v>

510
00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.400
<v Speaker 1>it should be a laissez faire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should just allow commerce to </v>

511
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 1>flourish and allow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow problems to work themselves out.</v>

512
00:24:01.851 --> 00:24:06.851
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't have confidence in that </v>

513
00:24:06.851 --> 00:24:06.851
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not because of any failure,</v>

514
00:24:06.851 --> 00:24:11.771
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like the ideology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power has become a kind of a modern </v>

515
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:17.111
<v Speaker 1>cancer that affects a flicks everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we need to do something </v>

516
00:24:17.111 --> 00:24:17.130
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

517
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.860
<v Speaker 1>can you explain that a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

518
00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:23.861
<v Speaker 1>it's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you believe that you can control </v>

519
00:24:23.861 --> 00:24:26.480
<v Speaker 1>the path of history and you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>endpoint in mind,</v>

520
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.690
<v Speaker 1>society should look like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you want to use every kind of tool </v>

521
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 1>to hammer it in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what I called right and left</v>

522
00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:37.410
<v Speaker 1>wing who galleon agonism essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

523
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a grave temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we built this,</v>

524
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.700
<v Speaker 1>like we said at the outset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we built this gigantic machinery we </v>

525
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.520
<v Speaker 1>call the state this total state and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

526
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.750
<v Speaker 1>So much wealth and so much power and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much rests with,</v>

527
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:51.550
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

528
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.010
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

529
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:58.060
<v Speaker 1>gaining access to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it just a kind of a constant moral </v>

530
00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:58.700
<v Speaker 1>hazard for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

531
00:24:58.701 --> 00:25:03.701
<v Speaker 1>give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me that state and I'll make it do </v>

532
00:25:03.701 --> 00:25:05.741
<v Speaker 1>the right things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the people that are on either </v>

533
00:25:05.741 --> 00:25:05.741
<v Speaker 1>side of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're on the left and,</v>

534
00:25:05.741 --> 00:25:10.330
<v Speaker 1>and you want to help those that you deem</v>
<v Speaker 1>have pressed more people with less when </v>

535
00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I believe their intentions to be good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if their methodology I think </v>

536
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.281
<v Speaker 1>generally is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or your people on the right that want </v>

537
00:25:18.281 --> 00:25:18.281
<v Speaker 1>less of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

538
00:25:18.281 --> 00:25:18.410
<v Speaker 1>you're just on either side of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

539
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.890
<v Speaker 1>How much do you think the system itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>can move without breaking?</v>

540
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Because what I think I'm noticing now is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a certain amount of people </v>

541
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.041
<v Speaker 1>that really just want to trash the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and I do see this certainly more </v>

542
00:25:33.041 --> 00:25:37.481
<v Speaker 1>on the left right now because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not empower that there's this growing </v>

543
00:25:37.481 --> 00:25:39.200
<v Speaker 1>thing and this is why they're so into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxism and all this stuff now.</v>

544
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like let's just trash the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking thing and forget all the </v>

545
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.021
<v Speaker 1>goodness that this is done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're doing it from their iphones </v>

546
00:25:47.021 --> 00:25:47.930
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sense of irony is not great,</v>

547
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.240
<v Speaker 1>but is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>

548
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:55.360
<v Speaker 1>is there just a certain amount that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system that's basically good can move </v>

549
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.020
<v Speaker 1>before it snaps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

550
00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I would suspect that that's not much </v>
<v Speaker 1>either way really.</v>

551
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean the commercial structure?</v>

552
00:26:02.871 --> 00:26:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Right now our lives are capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>

553
00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

554
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:12.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I see actually happening is the </v>

555
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:12.370
<v Speaker 1>innovation has taken place so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually out running.</v>

556
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.840
<v Speaker 1>They have the capacity of government to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control it.</v>

557
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.870
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really exciting if I was going to</v>

558
00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:22.871
<v Speaker 1>look at one point of hope in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and set the market and the </v>

559
00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:27.941
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial innovative sectors of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life from the APP economy to the Gig </v>

560
00:26:27.941 --> 00:26:31.391
<v Speaker 1>economy to now with blockchain </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and everything is moving so </v>

561
00:26:31.391 --> 00:26:34.220
<v Speaker 1>quickly that states can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't even keep up.</v>

562
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm there with you on that because </v>

563
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Gloria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very happy about that.</v>

564
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it's like how are people listening</v>

565
00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>to all of these conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these podcasts that are out there</v>

566
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 2>and communicating about them so quickly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like the government can't.</v>

567
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep up with all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The change can't because people are </v>

568
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.420
<v Speaker 2>lighting up all the time now in a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster way.</v>

569
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:59.570
<v Speaker 2>And I think we're changing in a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more rapid way and I think that's </v>

570
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.931
<v Speaker 2>actually really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a danger to it because we could </v>

571
00:27:02.931 --> 00:27:02.931
<v Speaker 2>just spin out of control and do all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of awful things.</v>

572
00:27:02.931 --> 00:27:04.270
<v Speaker 2>But what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

573
00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:09.340
<v Speaker 2>what did you say before about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>general inertia of people or something </v>

574
00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 2>that the general left to their own ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>of figuring things out?</v>

575
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:13.280
<v Speaker 2>I figured it out.</v>

576
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:19.240
<v Speaker 1>The reason why our politics seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactionary on the left and the right.</v>

577
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's trying to bring back </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

578
00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:27.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a nostalgia on the left and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish a on the right and they're </v>

579
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:31.141
<v Speaker 1>trying to use the state to hold us back </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in and whatever.</v>

580
00:27:31.211 --> 00:27:33.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a vision of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the sixties?</v>

581
00:27:33.401 --> 00:27:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it the seventies?</v>

582
00:27:35.381 --> 00:27:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Is it preindustrial revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

583
00:27:38.231 --> 00:27:43.231
<v Speaker 1>is at some risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he and fantasy of perfect equality </v>

584
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:43.400
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left might imagine,</v>

585
00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.460
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

586
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:45.760
<v Speaker 1>or the ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

587
00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.080
<v Speaker 1>thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

588
00:27:47.081 --> 00:27:51.320
<v Speaker 1>a world of high tariffs of the 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties or nineties are.</v>

589
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.760
<v Speaker 1>But everyone's looking back to something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they want to create and there's a </v>

590
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.150
<v Speaker 1>real fear of the future and the left and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>

591
00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:03.360
<v Speaker 1>And as a future without control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a future where we're able to </v>

592
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.390
<v Speaker 1>travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we want to download the apps.</v>

593
00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:07.450
<v Speaker 1>We want to invent what we want to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>by ourselves,</v>

594
00:28:07.451 --> 00:28:11.050
<v Speaker 1>live where we want to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be digital nomads,</v>

595
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel around,</v>

596
00:28:12.611 --> 00:28:14.440
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want this,</v>

597
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.780
<v Speaker 2>this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what people should be.</v>

598
00:28:17.781 --> 00:28:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Fewer people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should be going,</v>

599
00:28:19.451 --> 00:28:21.880
<v Speaker 2>holy cow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the free is coolest thing ever.</v>

600
00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.130
<v Speaker 2>That's the world I want to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to live.</v>

601
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:29.280
<v Speaker 2>That obviously is why you're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted to bitcoin and crypto in </v>

602
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.160
<v Speaker 2>general because you're sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>backbone.</v>

603
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Well out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you think about it,</v>

604
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've waited our whole lives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually generations of great </v>

605
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.780
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals have lived and lived and </v>
<v Speaker 1>died for so long,</v>

606
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:43.040
<v Speaker 1>wanting something like a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency that,</v>

607
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:48.550
<v Speaker 1>that emerged privately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that operates without financial </v>

608
00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.611
<v Speaker 1>intermediaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the government is not controlling </v>

609
00:28:51.611 --> 00:28:51.611
<v Speaker 1>that it's global.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't.</v>

610
00:28:51.611 --> 00:28:55.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not restrained by currency zones </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anyone could have access to.</v>

611
00:28:55.730 --> 00:29:00.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a true democratic technology like </v>

612
00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:01.970
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin or any cryptocurrency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is just a dream come true.</v>

613
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.790
<v Speaker 1>That is Gloria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I write about it all the time</v>

614
00:29:04.791 --> 00:29:06.350
<v Speaker 1>and talk about it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

615
00:29:06.351 --> 00:29:08.750
<v Speaker 1>it is the outright killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the alt left killer.</v>

616
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:14.030
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that's going to </v>

617
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:14.030
<v Speaker 1>ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

618
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.380
<v Speaker 1>protect us from these wicked ideologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are constantly trying to control </v>

619
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:17.380
<v Speaker 1>their lives</v>

620
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:22.070
<v Speaker 2>because basically at some point one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideologies is gonna get too much </v>

621
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.250
<v Speaker 2>control of the state forever.</v>

622
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

623
00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:30.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sometimes when you get depressed </v>

624
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 1>about the divisions in our public life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way people are tearing,</v>

625
00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.450
<v Speaker 1>tearing each other apart and the way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>opened up the newspaper and this,</v>

626
00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.900
<v Speaker 1>you can barely even read it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

627
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

628
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

629
00:29:39.671 --> 00:29:41.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's like Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You then just like,</v>

630
00:29:41.691 --> 00:29:42.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put trump,</v>

631
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:43.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just,</v>

632
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.680
<v Speaker 1>it's just this forever debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one thing that I think maybe we </v>

633
00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:51.460
<v Speaker 1>should not be entirely unhappy about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

634
00:29:51.461 --> 00:29:53.140
<v Speaker 1>As you look back at history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

635
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.780
<v Speaker 1>when freedom emerges out of the high </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle ages,</v>

636
00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:01.050
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't because any one great </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual or anyone great state or </v>

637
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.200
<v Speaker 1>anyone great power said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

638
00:30:02.201 --> 00:30:07.201
<v Speaker 1>let's let everybody be free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was because there's so many </v>

639
00:30:07.201 --> 00:30:07.630
<v Speaker 1>competitors for power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They nobody could,</v>

640
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:12.010
<v Speaker 1>could gain the monopoly was the church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the,</v>

641
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:17.100
<v Speaker 1>the nation state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the localities and monarchical </v>

642
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

643
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the landed aristocracy,</v>

644
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

645
00:30:20.521 --> 00:30:22.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise of the merchant class,</v>

646
00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are all these independent power</v>

647
00:30:25.091 --> 00:30:28.390
<v Speaker 1>centers strewn throughout European </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and nobody could get,</v>

648
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.190
<v Speaker 1>get access to the finals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single singular control,</v>

649
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.810
<v Speaker 1>no unitary power.</v>

650
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And that fight that took place amongst </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many disparate powers to actually </v>

651
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.770
<v Speaker 1>lead to a kind of flourishing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

652
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:47.190
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense the fight between the left </v>

653
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.190
<v Speaker 1>and the right today is not the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

654
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.750
<v Speaker 1>If they just keep fighting and leave the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of us alone.</v>

655
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lucky,</v>

656
00:30:53.171 --> 00:30:55.630
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so before we spend the whole second half</v>

657
00:30:55.631 --> 00:31:00.631
<v Speaker 1>on the question that I started this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing with the people who want </v>

658
00:31:00.631 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 1>freedom basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a light touch of government,</v>

659
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:07.020
<v Speaker 1>are they always at a disadvantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's another set of people </v>

660
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.370
<v Speaker 1>who will always use the apparatus </v>
<v Speaker 1>against them where if they're being true</v>

661
00:31:09.371 --> 00:31:12.820
<v Speaker 1>to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't use the power to stifle other</v>

662
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:14.350
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were all sorts of other things,</v>

663
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.120
<v Speaker 1>so in an odd way our ideas are at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantage,</v>

664
00:31:17.121 --> 00:31:17.860
<v Speaker 1>always have been.</v>

665
00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.830
<v Speaker 1>We've always been a kind of minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even again,</v>

666
00:31:20.831 --> 00:31:25.831
<v Speaker 1>over the last two or 300 years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political history have always been the </v>

667
00:31:25.831 --> 00:31:26.980
<v Speaker 1>third way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine,</v>

668
00:31:26.981 --> 00:31:27.970
<v Speaker 1>man already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we had,</v>

669
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:30.400
<v Speaker 1>we had rare victories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but big ones,</v>

670
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the end of slavery,</v>

671
00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

672
00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:38.460
<v Speaker 1>was just glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the protection of the great </v>

673
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.490
<v Speaker 1>banking empires of Europe from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the populace rabble,</v>

674
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

675
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.550
<v Speaker 1>from the preachers who wanted to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

676
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.940
<v Speaker 1>There were these great victories of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory of free trade,</v>

677
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

678
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:51.570
<v Speaker 1>but we've won every once in a while and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it always changed the world because once</v>

679
00:31:51.571 --> 00:31:53.980
<v Speaker 1>we have a little bit of freedom just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

680
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.310
<v Speaker 1>it just blows up and it becomes awesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's amazing and it.</v>

681
00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.670
<v Speaker 1>And it kills power because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and so wonderful.</v>

682
00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:02.140
<v Speaker 1>But it's worth fighting for.</v>

683
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And we've always fought mainly through </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

684
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.830
<v Speaker 1>not through armies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not through through guns and controlling</v>

685
00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:13.831
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been the philosophical </v>

686
00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:16.210
<v Speaker 1>awesomeness of this position has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>the celebration of the common man,</v>

687
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:17.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

688
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.450
<v Speaker 1>the celebration of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wealth,</v>

689
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.480
<v Speaker 1>of the love of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of consumerism and commercial life for </v>

690
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.760
<v Speaker 1>the coming together of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the noble meant of people that the right</v>

691
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.900
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of travel,</v>

692
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.440
<v Speaker 1>the right of association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to do what you want to have as many </v>

693
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.700
<v Speaker 1>children as you want to educate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids the way you want to,</v>

694
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:40.710
<v Speaker 1>that these kinds of principles are </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling and they've always lead to </v>

695
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:45.491
<v Speaker 1>victory for liberals despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure from the other two sides.</v>

696
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.200
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be our future.</v>

697
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's shift.</v>

698
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

699
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do this and we adapted.</v>

700
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 1>We did the happy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to plunge to look.</v>

701
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:57.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

702
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.920
<v Speaker 1>when I began to research this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably ended up reading about 200 </v>

703
00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.420
<v Speaker 1>books on this topic when the end and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a happy guy.</v>

704
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I like happy things like technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an optimistic guy,</v>

705
00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:12.140
<v Speaker 1>but this really put me in a dark place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a digging through this history,</v>

706
00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

707
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.010
<v Speaker 1>from Hagle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially up to Julius Caesar,</v>

708
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:21.011
<v Speaker 1>Eveleigh and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the post were Nazi movement and </v>

709
00:33:21.011 --> 00:33:24.371
<v Speaker 1>realizing that there is an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>strain that stretched over all of these </v>

710
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back 200 years.</v>

711
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go back 200 years when you talk</v>

712
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:32.360
<v Speaker 1>about right wing collectivism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

713
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Because I think most of my audience now </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands what left wing collectivism </v>

714
00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:38.050
<v Speaker 1>is because that's what we've got right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

715
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Very in a very strong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to me about right wing </v>

716
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:43.270
<v Speaker 1>collectivism.</v>

717
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

718
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

719
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Ludovico muses.</v>

720
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

721
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:55.120
<v Speaker 1>And I thought I'd read all of his works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in there is a transcript of a </v>

722
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.741
<v Speaker 1>lecture he gave in 1956 at the San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco Public Library and he had </v>

723
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:05.081
<v Speaker 1>about three sentences in there that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked me over it and I couldn't </v>

724
00:34:05.081 --> 00:34:09.521
<v Speaker 1>believe it because it explained so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says something like this and he's </v>

725
00:34:09.521 --> 00:34:10.570
<v Speaker 1>speaking casually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

726
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hagle ruined German philosophy for a </v>

727
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.000
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

728
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.330
<v Speaker 1>his original followers became a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

729
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:25.390
<v Speaker 1>believed that all of history would end </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Prussian state and the Prussian </v>

730
00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:27.400
<v Speaker 1>church having all power and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individualism,</v>

731
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.440
<v Speaker 1>individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they became the right hit galleons that </v>

732
00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.520
<v Speaker 1>became the Nazis is the dissonance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

733
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:35.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the writer.</v>

734
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Galleons became the left to galleons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted a universal transformation </v>

735
00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.651
<v Speaker 1>of humanity and a historical drive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something other than the commercial </v>

736
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:45.350
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

737
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.760
<v Speaker 1>They became the Marxists and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

738
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:51.980
<v Speaker 1>and the communists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that that's it's left,</v>

739
00:34:51.981 --> 00:34:55.370
<v Speaker 1>right Galleon ism and that explains </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much all the political history.</v>

740
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And I closed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that explains more than </v>

741
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:03.410
<v Speaker 1>practically any other book I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

742
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.470
<v Speaker 1>And so I began to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to explore this.</v>

743
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I understood the left together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understood Marxism.</v>

744
00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:11.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those were,</v>

745
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.160
<v Speaker 1>those were our professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

746
00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're annoying.</v>

747
00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I did not understand was the </v>

748
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:21.710
<v Speaker 1>right who galleon ism and what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that tradition looks like.</v>

749
00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:24.610
<v Speaker 1>It's the throne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And alter this,</v>

750
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.700
<v Speaker 1>this historic view that the nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>should constitute its own unit of </v>

751
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.870
<v Speaker 1>profound integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

752
00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.960
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is more important than the,</v>

753
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:41.020
<v Speaker 1>than the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that commercial society was too </v>

754
00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:41.020
<v Speaker 1>chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>

755
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was leading us,</v>

756
00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:47.340
<v Speaker 1>giving us the wrong kind of progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was flattening out the </v>

757
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.280
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies that we need to have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly life,</v>

758
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:50.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

759
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.760
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the right who galleon pitch that</v>

760
00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:57.780
<v Speaker 1>ultimately by mid 20th century becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>this very dangerous,</v>

761
00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 1>dangerous movement in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

762
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became catastrophic,</v>

763
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gradually emerged from all the </v>

764
00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:09.600
<v Speaker 1>way from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Hagle because,</v>

765
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is at the end of the endless,</v>

766
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.040
<v Speaker 1>seemingly endless Franco pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>awards.</v>

767
00:36:15.041 --> 00:36:16.980
<v Speaker 1>There's this battle of the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jenna that,</v>

768
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:22.550
<v Speaker 1>that Germany lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the explanation for that was that </v>

769
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:23.560
<v Speaker 1>was a temporary setback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That history,</v>

770
00:36:23.561 --> 00:36:27.480
<v Speaker 1>it was going to determine that Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>would rise just despite,</v>

771
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.620
<v Speaker 1>despite the choices and individual's </v>
<v Speaker 1>history has got its wind.</v>

772
00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Meta narrative that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

773
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:39.200
<v Speaker 1>that was going to override everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hegel himself was a theologian by the </v>

774
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:39.200
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

775
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so this,</v>

776
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.970
<v Speaker 1>this view began to kind of spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout German academia and it was,</v>

777
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.450
<v Speaker 1>it ended up being important to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States through,</v>

778
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.180
<v Speaker 1>through circuitous means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

779
00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.610
<v Speaker 1>but one of the great theorists of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the team forties,</v>

780
00:36:54.611 --> 00:36:59.611
<v Speaker 1>who am 18 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who brought the suit to the United </v>

781
00:36:59.611 --> 00:37:02.210
<v Speaker 1>States was Frederick List,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the first economist to </v>

782
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.740
<v Speaker 1>repudiate the free trade tradition of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

783
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.390
<v Speaker 1>of the Smithian a Manchester Rights.</v>

784
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And now we're celebrating the nation as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

785
00:37:08.641 --> 00:37:10.980
<v Speaker 1>as a unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a productive power,</v>

786
00:37:10.981 --> 00:37:12.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

787
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and believed in tariff walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

788
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:17.370
<v Speaker 1>which was strange and I've read his </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

789
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

790
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:24.080
<v Speaker 1>and that had a huge influence over </v>
<v Speaker 1>American trade policy is actually the </v>

791
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.290
<v Speaker 1>late 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

792
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:26.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

793
00:37:26.941 --> 00:37:29.250
<v Speaker 1>it began to flow out from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Thomas,</v>

794
00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Carlyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

795
00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:35.610
<v Speaker 1>and in Britain now begins to celebrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great man theory of history.</v>

796
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And really we're nothing without </v>
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon,</v>

797
00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:44.691
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without gigantic figures that we can </v>

798
00:37:44.691 --> 00:37:47.751
<v Speaker 1>worship at Meijer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And individuality should be subsumed </v>

799
00:37:47.751 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 1>within them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They act for us,</v>

800
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.280
<v Speaker 1>God like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

801
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.390
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

802
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 1>and it was Thomas Carlyle who first </v>
<v Speaker 1>coined the phrase,</v>

803
00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm a coined the phrase to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics as being the dismal science.</v>

804
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.270
<v Speaker 1>And the reason he said that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every economist,</v>

805
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 1>team new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined a world without slavery,</v>

806
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.100
<v Speaker 1>and he said you to have a website </v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>

807
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:15.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a dreadful world without slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have masters,</v>

808
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

809
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.110
<v Speaker 1>And we need a world with masters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves so we can,</v>

810
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.470
<v Speaker 1>we can have a vision of hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatness without that,</v>

811
00:38:22.471 --> 00:38:25.560
<v Speaker 1>we don't have greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we began to see this building of this</v>

812
00:38:25.561 --> 00:38:28.330
<v Speaker 1>intellectual apparatus that was not left</v>
<v Speaker 1>to galleon.</v>

813
00:38:28.331 --> 00:38:31.560
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anti Marxist in a strange way,</v>

814
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.810
<v Speaker 1>but as an alternative form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivism,</v>

815
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:34.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

816
00:38:34.891 --> 00:38:39.891
<v Speaker 1>it began with a kind of historicism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a celebration on nationalism with a </v>

817
00:38:39.891 --> 00:38:40.570
<v Speaker 1>German stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to grow with this,</v>

818
00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.760
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this alternative theory of trade that we</v>

819
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:44.380
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should build up tariff walls.</v>

820
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.160
<v Speaker 1>And Carlisle with his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his great man theory of history.</v>

821
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.480
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

822
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rueskin and Britain with his haste hate </v>

823
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 1>hatred of Commercial Society because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they believed that somehow a commerce </v>

824
00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.531
<v Speaker 1>which ruined in quality and culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>was giving us mass production and by we </v>

825
00:39:01.531 --> 00:39:03.810
<v Speaker 1>all need to be really doing this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

826
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in guilds and making our own </v>

827
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

828
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.060
<v Speaker 1>because we're going to destroy English </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and English country life.</v>

829
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:13.210
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a full scale reactionary trend on the</v>

830
00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:18.211
<v Speaker 1>right began to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was always a racial element to </v>

831
00:39:18.211 --> 00:39:20.180
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what's interesting.</v>

832
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad you asked that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes about,</v>

833
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:23.130
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

834
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:27.460
<v Speaker 1>through nationalism now and the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early 18,</v>

835
00:39:27.461 --> 00:39:28.560
<v Speaker 1>20,018</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties,</v>

836
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.960
<v Speaker 1>this celebration of nationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to ask yourself,</v>

837
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:36.250
<v Speaker 1>what is a nation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we mean when we say nation?</v>

838
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.550
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm taking this,</v>

839
00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:43.300
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a,</v>

840
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:48.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an essay gave it given to 1882 by Aaron </v>

841
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:49.850
<v Speaker 1>ran in a great French historian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

842
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:55.140
<v Speaker 1>looking back at the rise of nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's only five ways you can </v>

843
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.160
<v Speaker 1>consider nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You consider,</v>

844
00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the geographic definition,</v>

845
00:39:57.791 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Speaker 1>so we're just living in this space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a dynastic element.</v>

846
00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:04.990
<v Speaker 1>We can all trace our lineage back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great founders of our nation.</v>

847
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.730
<v Speaker 1>There is a language theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism.</v>

848
00:40:06.731 --> 00:40:11.731
<v Speaker 1>We all speak the same language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a religious theory of </v>

849
00:40:11.731 --> 00:40:12.520
<v Speaker 1>nationalism all worship a god and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely the same way.</v>

850
00:40:12.521 --> 00:40:17.521
<v Speaker 1>I believe in transubstantiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe in consubstantiation we </v>

851
00:40:17.521 --> 00:40:17.521
<v Speaker 1>can't be part of the same nation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gates.</v>

852
00:40:17.521 --> 00:40:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>

853
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 1>and probably most insidiously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a racial,</v>

854
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:26.930
<v Speaker 1>the racial view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that came along and essentially the </v>

855
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:31.321
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties and seventies with a </v>

856
00:40:31.321 --> 00:40:33.820
<v Speaker 1>misapplication of Darwinian theory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific racism came along.</v>

857
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's wet through academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the United States,</v>

858
00:40:37.811 --> 00:40:42.811
<v Speaker 1>like nothing you've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was absolutely astonishing how much </v>

859
00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:47.250
<v Speaker 1>racism with Orthodoxy and American </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia in the 1890 [inaudible],</v>

860
00:40:47.251 --> 00:40:52.251
<v Speaker 1>some of the very first monograph </v>
<v Speaker 1>published by the American Economic </v>

861
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Economic Association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black Gay man,</v>

862
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.440
<v Speaker 1>I think his name is Andre Hoffman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was called race traits of the American </v>

863
00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Negro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first chapter dress goes all in.</v>

864
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

865
00:41:01.661 --> 00:41:04.630
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the horror of the black people that</v>

866
00:41:04.631 --> 00:41:06.030
<v Speaker 1>don't have the right values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can't,</v>

867
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.050
<v Speaker 1>can't save money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just terrible.</v>

868
00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:12.410
<v Speaker 1>A shiftless and lazy and ghastly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncivilized,</v>

869
00:41:12.411 --> 00:41:13.420
<v Speaker 1>double.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now chapter two,</v>

870
00:41:13.421 --> 00:41:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

871
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.650
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they've got this crazy</v>

872
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.650
<v Speaker 1>out of control commercial ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't stop hoarding money.</v>

873
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.030
<v Speaker 1>They really went for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

874
00:41:25.031 --> 00:41:27.730
<v Speaker 1>And then the third chapter three is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>slots and so on.</v>

875
00:41:27.731 --> 00:41:29.620
<v Speaker 1>And so the American Economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Association,</v>

876
00:41:29.621 --> 00:41:31.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

877
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was essentially no,</v>

878
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.510
<v Speaker 1>what do you think was happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world there?</v>

879
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:37.220
<v Speaker 1>That it was taking a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was happening,</v>

880
00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:42.240
<v Speaker 1>David Laissez faire had transformed </v>
<v Speaker 1>society so dramatically that the </v>

881
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:49.450
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals felt that they had lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and now you might think that </v>

882
00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.951
<v Speaker 1>when the world becomes massively </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperous and we suddenly have cities </v>

883
00:41:53.951 --> 00:41:57.911
<v Speaker 1>rising up and we've got steel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transversing large bodies of water and </v>

884
00:41:57.911 --> 00:42:00.280
<v Speaker 1>we're developing the telephone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>indoor electricity and,</v>

885
00:42:00.281 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 1>and people are living longer lives and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so much wealth is being created that</v>

886
00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:05.950
<v Speaker 1>everybody was data per say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hooray.</v>

887
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:11.100
<v Speaker 1>We found the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the gatekeepers who had controlled </v>

888
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.321
<v Speaker 1>everything for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's so interesting because of </v>

889
00:42:14.321 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 1>revolt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of what it feels like now </v>

890
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gatekeepers,</v>

891
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.320
<v Speaker 1>we've had so much success.</v>

892
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:23.320
<v Speaker 1>There's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many reasons right now to </v>

893
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 1>understand how great everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That book right there by Steven Pinker,</v>

894
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:30.040
<v Speaker 1>enlightened misery is all about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>great things are and how grateful we </v>

895
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.280
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is less violence now and all sorts</v>

896
00:42:32.281 --> 00:42:37.281
<v Speaker 1>of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the revolt you always have to be </v>

897
00:42:37.281 --> 00:42:39.791
<v Speaker 1>on like the gatekeepers are having when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the narrative intellectuals or what </v>

898
00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Deirdre mccloskey calls the clerisy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

899
00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:46.901
<v Speaker 1>So it's the high end intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the power elite bureaucrats and the</v>

900
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.480
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the permanent peace keepers of our civic</v>

901
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:51.230
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

902
00:42:51.231 --> 00:42:53.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the political class.</v>

903
00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.780
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is sorta what for,</v>

904
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.440
<v Speaker 1>for my audience that maybe not follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

905
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.230
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of what the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 1>is sort of like.</v>

906
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I shouldn't have said it.</v>

907
00:43:02.931 --> 00:43:05.210
<v Speaker 1>So obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like that's kind of what it is.</v>

908
00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Like that class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ruling class,</v>

909
00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 1>the ruling class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were in full scale revolted.</v>

910
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.790
<v Speaker 1>They did not like what was happening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and the 18,</v>

911
00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:15.950
<v Speaker 1>eighties and nineties because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss of control.</v>

912
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:21.310
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific racism came along to add </v>

913
00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:24.371
<v Speaker 1>to the celebration of dictatorship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the and the and protectionism and the </v>

914
00:43:24.471 --> 00:43:29.471
<v Speaker 1>new nationalism to add a very insidious </v>
<v Speaker 1>element which culminated in eugenics </v>

915
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:33.770
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when it gets very strange.</v>

916
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:38.771
<v Speaker 1>And this is where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where the reading gets very </v>

917
00:43:38.771 --> 00:43:38.960
<v Speaker 1>difficult because now you're reading all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way into a,</v>

918
00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

919
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:44.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19th tens with the works of Oswald </v>

920
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Spangler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

921
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right who galleon German theorist </v>

922
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.430
<v Speaker 1>that enraptured every American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

923
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:49.610
<v Speaker 1>they're all reading his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

924
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:55.030
<v Speaker 1>the decline of the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We better reconstitute ourselves as the </v>

925
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.420
<v Speaker 1>tribe or we're going to be eaten alive </v>
<v Speaker 1>by another four.</v>

926
00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.020
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a strain of that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>still going on right now.</v>

927
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.540
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

928
00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:03.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

929
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:04.090
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

930
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:09.100
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this very funny book called the passing </v>

931
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.561
<v Speaker 1>of the great race by Madison grant that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on every coffee table in the late 19</v>

932
00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:16.580
<v Speaker 1>teens and early 19th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th,</v>

933
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:17.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

934
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.740
<v Speaker 1>was forecasting doom for the white race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

935
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.100
<v Speaker 1>when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a fascinating figure because,</v>

936
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

937
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:25.940
<v Speaker 1>of course I've read his book as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it everybody did.</v>

938
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Everybody a great gatsby makes a passing</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference to it.</v>

939
00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:31.010
<v Speaker 1>It was that popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that popular.</v>

940
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:35.190
<v Speaker 1>And I tell you there's not a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>outright racist alive today who hasn't,</v>

941
00:44:35.191 --> 00:44:38.010
<v Speaker 1>is not repeating those cliches that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>written by Madison.</v>

942
00:44:38.011 --> 00:44:43.011
<v Speaker 1>Grant is all pseudoscience is all just </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense and it's just ridiculous and </v>

943
00:44:43.011 --> 00:44:43.011
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

944
00:44:43.011 --> 00:44:45.330
<v Speaker 1>but it keeps being resurrected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's what's interesting,</v>

945
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:50.570
<v Speaker 1>he was a thoroughgoing a Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she recall that Darwin had two </v>

946
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.790
<v Speaker 1>great books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>origin these pieces.</v>

947
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:58.790
<v Speaker 1>The other was called the descent of man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the descent of man had the very </v>

948
00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:00.240
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate paragraph in there where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gret regrets,</v>

949
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:03.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the invention of mass,</v>

950
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.660
<v Speaker 1>a disease killing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

951
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:11.020
<v Speaker 1>a juror's essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if we keep curing people and </v>

952
00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.411
<v Speaker 1>we keep feeding a inferior people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>curing disease than then our genetic </v>

953
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.880
<v Speaker 1>stocks going to go down and down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

954
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:20.430
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they are all kind of playing off this</v>

955
00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.300
<v Speaker 1>little passage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Madison grant was,</v>

956
00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:27.450
<v Speaker 1>was not an unusual by American x to </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic standards at all.</v>

957
00:45:27.451 --> 00:45:28.050
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

958
00:45:28.051 --> 00:45:29.950
<v Speaker 1>This was orthodox in the 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

959
00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:33.090
<v Speaker 1>19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What made Madison Grant Interesting?</v>

960
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:35.760
<v Speaker 1>You can look up his wikipedia entry </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

961
00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look it up,</v>

962
00:45:37.111 --> 00:45:38.820
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll celebrate him as the,</v>

963
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 1>as the father of the National Park </v>
<v Speaker 1>Service.</v>

964
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the course of my research,</v>

965
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I wondered to know what is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection between Madison's grants,</v>

966
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:54.080
<v Speaker 1>hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eugenics based racism and its </v>

967
00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.220
<v Speaker 1>environmental design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the relationship there?</v>

968
00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just two people.</v>

969
00:45:57.661 --> 00:46:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Usually people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have it figured out in their own head.</v>

970
00:46:00.341 --> 00:46:02.280
<v Speaker 1>So I went through and read some of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>works on,</v>

971
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:07.360
<v Speaker 1>on the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that he had a master race </v>

972
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.001
<v Speaker 1>theory of nature and he went to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>California redwoods and he looked at </v>

973
00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:14.601
<v Speaker 1>these glorious mighty trees and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrified to see they're being cut down </v>

974
00:46:14.601 --> 00:46:14.601
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

975
00:46:14.601 --> 00:46:19.490
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for making coffee tables and boats and </v>

976
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:22.101
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you thought it was this gigantic to </v>

977
00:46:22.101 --> 00:46:22.200
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he wanted the master race,</v>

978
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the California redwoods to,</v>

979
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:26.940
<v Speaker 1>to be protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's that.</v>

980
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's why he started the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>park service.</v>

981
00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:34.340
<v Speaker 1>And now the left heroism is as great as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a great visionary environmentalist.</v>

982
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:38.950
<v Speaker 1>But actually he was like a tree Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how else you want to go.</v>

983
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:45.230
<v Speaker 1>It's very creepy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have enough Nazi labels being </v>

984
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.230
<v Speaker 1>thrown around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to have tree nuts.</v>

985
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that already was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

986
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:52.730
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just march through the history </v>

987
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:52.730
<v Speaker 1>and it gets worse and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to me,</v>

988
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

989
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.650
<v Speaker 1>it'll culminates in the works of Carl </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schmidt,</v>

990
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

991
00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:02.330
<v Speaker 1>from the late 19 thirties and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his amazing book called the concept </v>

992
00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:06.291
<v Speaker 1>of the political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you'll give me just one quick </v>

993
00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:07.830
<v Speaker 1>second to explain this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because because you as a liberal need to</v>

994
00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:11.220
<v Speaker 1>read this book because it's the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate,</v>

995
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an even competent attack on liberalism </v>

996
00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Britain in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

997
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Carl Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a jurist?</v>

998
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:20.670
<v Speaker 1>A brilliant man and a philosopher and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore Nazi.</v>

999
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't tried at Nuremberg.</v>

1000
00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:25.860
<v Speaker 1>He escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm merely an intellectual.</v>

1001
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1002
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:31.560
<v Speaker 1>His book concept of the political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with liberalism?</v>

1003
00:47:31.561 --> 00:47:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dull.</v>

1004
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing dramatic.</v>

1005
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:39.070
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just requires no courage whatsoever.</v>

1006
00:47:39.071 --> 00:47:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Liberalism is a life in which we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit from each other's presence.</v>

1007
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 1>We all just trade with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of life is that?</v>

1008
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Where we all just are kind of the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like each other and help backyard </v>

1009
00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.481
<v Speaker 1>barbecues and baseball games and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>get richer and live longer lives and </v>

1010
00:47:54.481 --> 00:47:54.700
<v Speaker 1>send their kid to college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is terrible.</v>

1011
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.430
<v Speaker 1>We need to live big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic,</v>

1012
00:47:58.210 --> 00:47:59.770
<v Speaker 1>mighty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bold,</v>

1013
00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Speaker 1>courageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformative lives,</v>

1014
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:04.120
<v Speaker 1>and live in times that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1015
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:04.800
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1016
00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.070
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are shocking,</v>

1017
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.200
<v Speaker 1>that are amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make our lives worth living.</v>

1018
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:13.710
<v Speaker 1>That requires above all else politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberalism imagines a world without </v>

1019
00:48:14.081 --> 00:48:16.060
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrifying world.</v>

1020
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:21.060
<v Speaker 1>What we need is a world of politics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he continues to lay it out chapter </v>

1021
00:48:21.191 --> 00:48:26.191
<v Speaker 1>by chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we have to destroy liberalism and </v>

1022
00:48:26.191 --> 00:48:30.001
<v Speaker 1>celebrate the concept of the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for him that means having friends </v>

1023
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:35.970
<v Speaker 1>and having enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defeating your enemies and rallying </v>

1024
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:39.451
<v Speaker 1>around your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now who are your friends and who your </v>

1025
00:48:39.451 --> 00:48:40.630
<v Speaker 1>enemies and mode says at some level it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>

1026
00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.650
<v Speaker 1>What matters is that they exist and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>

1027
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.170
<v Speaker 1>the powerful men will choose them for </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1028
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.270
<v Speaker 1>They will decide who our friends and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies are.</v>

1029
00:48:49.271 --> 00:48:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Now let's be clear what we mean by </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>

1030
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't stop me in somebody you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1031
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean the willingness to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be the presence of real </v>

1032
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.650
<v Speaker 1>bloodshed in your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For you to have a sufficiently prescient</v>

1033
00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.660
<v Speaker 1>sense of enemies so that you'll feel the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense desire to rally around your fin </v>

1034
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.730
<v Speaker 1>for your friends and experienced that.</v>

1035
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.200
<v Speaker 1>That the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1036
00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:17.230
<v Speaker 1>the awesomeness that only comes with </v>
<v Speaker 1>belonging to a group.</v>

1037
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:19.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he says,</v>

1038
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:20.280
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end,</v>

1039
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:24.030
<v Speaker 1>the end feeling there is that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve what,</v>

1040
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:27.020
<v Speaker 1>what the real purpose of a humanist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>

1041
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:32.160
<v Speaker 1>that you can experience whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highs of belongingness essentially </v>

1042
00:49:33.561 --> 00:49:38.561
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the life of drama that a big </v>

1043
00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:38.630
<v Speaker 1>important life without being part of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a,</v>

1044
00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.010
<v Speaker 1>a group on the move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slaughtering of center.</v>

1045
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 1>And so we have to have the presence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodshed.</v>

1046
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So it really is the opposite of live and</v>
<v Speaker 1>let live it is.</v>

1047
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 1>It's so through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

1048
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:49.780
<v Speaker 1>through bloodshed comes life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

1049
00:49:49.781 --> 00:49:52.600
<v Speaker 1>without bloodshed and death and violence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and politics,</v>

1050
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.750
<v Speaker 1>then you're just gonna live at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant life and we can't have that.</v>

1051
00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.500
<v Speaker 1>So he was in many ways of philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>architect of the Holocaust.</v>

1052
00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a leftist,</v>

1053
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 1>not a Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he dabbled in it.</v>

1054
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:08.610
<v Speaker 1>You find that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from a lot of these right </v>

1055
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:08.610
<v Speaker 1>collectivists the writer galleons that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they dabbled,</v>

1056
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:09.750
<v Speaker 1>guys like verner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sambar writings,</v>

1057
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.860
<v Speaker 1>wants a communist who later became a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi.</v>

1058
00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Carl Schmitt dabbled in and leftism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then went full,</v>

1059
00:50:15.281 --> 00:50:16.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1060
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:21.750
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in many ways the culmination to </v>

1061
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.750
<v Speaker 1>the right hand galleon ideology and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>encroachment.</v>

1062
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:23.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's a book worth reading and </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplating.</v>

1063
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.680
<v Speaker 1>And I would say to anybody who rejects </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism,</v>

1064
00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:33.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be honest about where you're going with </v>

1065
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:33.560
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the opposite of liberalism,</v>

1066
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.950
<v Speaker 1>the celebration of death and the quirks </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Schmidt,</v>

1067
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:41.000
<v Speaker 1>very powerful thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly regarded even today worth reading</v>

1068
00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:43.700
<v Speaker 1>and worth reflecting on what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>world do want to live in.</v>

1069
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Want to live in peace with others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you want to slaughter your </v>

1070
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:53.381
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughter your enemies and rally with </v>

1071
00:50:53.381 --> 00:50:55.001
<v Speaker 1>your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So move me from that point 19 thirties </v>

1072
00:50:55.001 --> 00:50:56.080
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1073
00:50:56.081 --> 00:50:59.170
<v Speaker 1>obviously into Nazi Germany and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

1074
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:00.760
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1075
00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1076
00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:04.120
<v Speaker 1>my book really does end in 1958.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily,</v>

1077
00:51:04.121 --> 00:51:05.180
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1078
00:51:05.181 --> 00:51:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I started to get really queasy about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened after World War Two.</v>

1079
00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:11.860
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the writer galleon movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>went underground,</v>

1080
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1081
00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:18.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and became a kind of a quiet neo Nazi </v>

1082
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:20.830
<v Speaker 1>movement that never really had access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>

1083
00:51:20.831 --> 00:51:23.770
<v Speaker 1>They clearly weren't in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

1084
00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.640
<v Speaker 1>And but the ideology never entirely went</v>
<v Speaker 1>away and,</v>

1085
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:29.530
<v Speaker 1>and it was just lying in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1086
00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:34.620
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the failure of the left and </v>

1087
00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.531
<v Speaker 1>for the resentment of the population </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the left to rise up and receive </v>

1088
00:51:37.531 --> 00:51:41.980
<v Speaker 1>a fevered enough pitch that it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would then come on full force.</v>

1089
00:51:41.981 --> 00:51:44.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

1090
00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

1091
00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.390
<v Speaker 1>it's an alternative form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivism,</v>

1092
00:51:49.391 --> 00:51:54.391
<v Speaker 1>has got a different flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different orientation at different </v>

1093
00:51:54.391 --> 00:51:58.111
<v Speaker 1>kinds of resentments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still drags in this gigantic </v>

1094
00:51:58.111 --> 00:51:59.770
<v Speaker 1>history of writing Ghillean ideology.</v>

1095
00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:03.130
<v Speaker 1>That celebration of that Dick Great man </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictated the protectionism,</v>

1096
00:52:03.131 --> 00:52:05.330
<v Speaker 1>the anti-immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nativism,</v>

1097
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the nationalism that could take any one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of five forms including the racism.</v>

1098
00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you make about how now?</v>

1099
00:52:12.461 --> 00:52:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And it's obviously largely because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>

1100
00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:17.650
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be happening in so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>places at once.</v>

1101
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:22.830
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing this unholy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an oddly unholy alliance between </v>

1102
00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:23.710
<v Speaker 1>the collectivist left and then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives,</v>

1103
00:52:23.711 --> 00:52:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly what you're saying.</v>

1104
00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got this other data that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just waiting there for these guys to go </v>

1105
00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:29.940
<v Speaker 1>to bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1106
00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:30.430
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got all these answers.</v>

1107
00:52:30.431 --> 00:52:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the liberals and everyone,</v>

1108
00:52:32.881 --> 00:52:37.881
<v Speaker 1>all the decent 80 percent of us that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to live in that part of it really</v>

1109
00:52:38.231 --> 00:52:41.650
<v Speaker 1>comes down to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a weird sociological,</v>

1110
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:45.640
<v Speaker 1>cultural contradiction at the heart of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social democratic leftist ideology.</v>

1111
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:50.880
<v Speaker 1>On one hand they they wanted to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic institutions that are </v>

1112
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.081
<v Speaker 1>redistributed Tori and we're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat each other like a big family and </v>

1113
00:52:55.081 --> 00:52:59.401
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to have this homogeneous </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation state and the other hand they're </v>

1114
00:52:59.401 --> 00:53:02.501
<v Speaker 1>celebrating diversity and encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass immigration and heterogeneous </v>

1115
00:53:02.501 --> 00:53:04.540
<v Speaker 1>populations and guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those don't really work together.</v>

1116
00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:09.590
<v Speaker 1>So you build gigantic institute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic states that presumed sort of.</v>

1117
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.510
<v Speaker 1>We're all one family and then you throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

1118
00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:15.400
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this diverse set of people,</v>

1119
00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:20.401
<v Speaker 1>especially with the refugee crisis in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and immigration in the United </v>

1120
00:53:20.401 --> 00:53:20.401
<v Speaker 1>States and people are looking around </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down,</v>

1121
00:53:20.401 --> 00:53:25.330
<v Speaker 1>these people are my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like these and yet I'm </v>

1122
00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:26.820
<v Speaker 1>paying for them and that is A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that that blows up.</v>

1123
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a disaster.</v>

1124
00:53:27.721 --> 00:53:32.721
<v Speaker 1>It's a powder keg and so is the left and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this core contradiction that </v>

1125
00:53:32.721 --> 00:53:36.550
<v Speaker 1>they have between on a welfare state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On one hand and their celebration,</v>

1126
00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Hetero heterogeneous populations on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other welfare state and diversity,</v>

1127
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:42.540
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't work.</v>

1128
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:45.360
<v Speaker 1>And that basically puts us where Germany</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of is at right now,</v>

1129
00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:46.410
<v Speaker 1>right where they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1130
00:53:46.411 --> 00:53:51.411
<v Speaker 1>3 million people come on in now all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are going to have to pay </v>

1131
00:53:51.411 --> 00:53:51.411
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

1132
00:53:51.411 --> 00:53:51.411
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to integrate you </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

1133
00:53:51.411 --> 00:53:56.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is not only to identitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements rising up in Germany and in </v>

1134
00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Hungary and of course in Russia and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course the US,</v>

1135
00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it all just kind of follows.</v>

1136
00:54:00.781 --> 00:54:01.800
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inevitable.</v>

1137
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 1>The left created this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>

1138
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:08.900
<v Speaker 1>if after World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had just embraced liberalism by we </v>

1139
00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:08.900
<v Speaker 1>should have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should have,</v>

1140
00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:13.341
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be where we are today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have another chance and that's </v>

1141
00:54:13.341 --> 00:54:13.341
<v Speaker 1>why you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I'm here.</v>

1142
00:54:13.341 --> 00:54:17.781
<v Speaker 1>We have another chance now to re embrace</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal liberal theory and to end to </v>

1143
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:19.460
<v Speaker 1>reject the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1144
00:54:19.461 --> 00:54:22.470
<v Speaker 1>And don't feel yourself just because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy of your enemy is,</v>

1145
00:54:22.471 --> 00:54:27.471
<v Speaker 1>is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean to ask to be your </v>

1146
00:54:27.471 --> 00:54:27.471
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1147
00:54:27.471 --> 00:54:29.900
<v Speaker 1>we really do need to think of ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>as kind of a distance from a political </v>

1148
00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:34.731
<v Speaker 1>culture that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rally around freedom and human </v>

1149
00:54:35.371 --> 00:54:39.780
<v Speaker 1>rights and universal human rights and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the enablement of humanity,</v>

1150
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:42.460
<v Speaker 1>the champion of the common person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1151
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.020
<v Speaker 1>the rights of everyone to live freely </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other,</v>

1152
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:51.021
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to gain value from each other and to </v>

1153
00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:52.941
<v Speaker 1>live in peace and stop thinking of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our fellow human beings as possible </v>

1154
00:54:52.941 --> 00:54:52.941
<v Speaker 1>enemies.</v>

1155
00:54:52.941 --> 00:54:56.940
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to get drafted into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>political world that Carl Schmitt.</v>

1156
00:54:56.941 --> 00:54:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Imagine for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I was describing crossfit you,</v>

1157
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.870
<v Speaker 1>you see it happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1158
00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:06.240
<v Speaker 1>That Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian View to slice and dice the </v>

1159
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:06.240
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you like?</v>

1160
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you hate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1161
00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are your people?</v>

1162
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a good life.</v>

1163
00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we feel it chopping away at both </v>

1164
00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:15.940
<v Speaker 1>sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1165
00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>

1166
00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:15.940
<v Speaker 1>We feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't,</v>

1167
00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I just don't feel like we have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it as best we can.</v>

1168
00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find things we love,</v>

1169
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:24.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go places we love me with people who</v>

1170
00:55:24.211 --> 00:55:27.380
<v Speaker 1>love of all different backgrounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all different kinds of cultures,</v>

1171
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:31.560
<v Speaker 1>learn about alternative religions or </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn about new ways to do things.</v>

1172
00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Travel right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the age of liberalism.</v>

1173
00:55:34.591 --> 00:55:36.540
<v Speaker 1>There were no such things as passports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1174
00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:38.520
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>

1175
00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:43.840
<v Speaker 1>let's spend the last portion here on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on just these last five years really </v>

1176
00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.520
<v Speaker 1>here in America because I remember just </v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

1177
00:55:45.521 --> 00:55:46.710
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be the last five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1178
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:51.060
<v Speaker 1>but let's say even three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just it's sort of the emergence of trump</v>

1179
00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:54.240
<v Speaker 1>as a candidate when people started </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying the phrase,</v>

1180
00:55:54.241 --> 00:55:55.050
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

1181
00:55:55.090 --> 00:56:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I did a bunch of videos on it where </v>

1182
00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:03.171
<v Speaker 1>I was basically saying I see two strains</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this thing and people are now using </v>

1183
00:56:03.171 --> 00:56:06.540
<v Speaker 1>this video against me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I saw was there was the sort of</v>

1184
00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:11.070
<v Speaker 1>fun me makers and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know all of the people who were having</v>

1185
00:56:11.071 --> 00:56:15.470
<v Speaker 1>fun online doing often doing awful </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and Nazi imagery just to,</v>

1186
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:17.880
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to upset people in power and whatever.</v>

1187
00:56:17.881 --> 00:56:20.130
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes it's very fun things too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And funny things,</v>

1188
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 1>but I saw it like just the real sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit posters they're known in the</v>

1189
00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.380
<v Speaker 2>gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole idea was we could get,</v>

1190
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:31.500
<v Speaker 2>we can start sending a frog to some like</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual and they're going to think </v>

1191
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:31.980
<v Speaker 2>that's a racist thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they would,</v>

1192
00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.530
<v Speaker 2>they would say I'm being under attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>from racist.</v>

1193
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.920
<v Speaker 2>They would actually give them exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they wanted.</v>

1194
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:42.150
<v Speaker 2>So I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of fun shit posting whatever </v>

1195
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:45.181
<v Speaker 2>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to say it didn't have elements I </v>

1196
00:56:45.181 --> 00:56:45.181
<v Speaker 2>didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were,</v>

1197
00:56:45.181 --> 00:56:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I saw that as the bulk of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then alongside of that was this,</v>

1198
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:50.120
<v Speaker 2>that you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>identitarian part,</v>

1199
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:55.140
<v Speaker 2>the true racist part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the part that had been sort of </v>

1200
00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:58.741
<v Speaker 2>underground for a long time and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of social media now is finding </v>

1201
00:56:58.741 --> 00:57:01.540
<v Speaker 2>that it could actually influence people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and beat it up.</v>

1202
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1203
00:57:01.871 --> 00:57:03.820
<v Speaker 2>So those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now and you know,</v>

1204
00:57:03.821 --> 00:57:08.821
<v Speaker 2>and I think the media really fueled both</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those things because basically when </v>

1205
00:57:08.821 --> 00:57:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Hillary said that deplorables comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

1206
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.570
<v Speaker 2>she just lumped the whole damn thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1207
00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:18.690
<v Speaker 2>And I think if she had not said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very possible she be </v>

1208
00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:21.961
<v Speaker 2>president anyhow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she helped the country almost made </v>

1209
00:57:21.961 --> 00:57:22.990
<v Speaker 2>they'll write exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was what my question really is.</v>

1210
00:57:22.991 --> 00:57:25.150
<v Speaker 2>How would you just define the alt right </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat out,</v>

1211
00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:30.151
<v Speaker 2>if I asked you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think the definition has </v>

1212
00:57:30.151 --> 00:57:32.761
<v Speaker 2>changed and has it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I asked you right now in the </v>

1213
00:57:32.761 --> 00:57:33.540
<v Speaker 2>summer of 2018 to definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

1214
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:34.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1215
00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:35.320
<v Speaker 2>the phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1216
00:57:35.321 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 2>comes about what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago,</v>

1217
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:38.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it was coined by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Paul God prayed,</v>

1218
00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:40.750
<v Speaker 2>who himself as a follower of Carl </v>
<v Speaker 2>Schmidt,</v>

1219
00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:42.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1220
00:57:42.381 --> 00:57:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I would rather look at this as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1221
00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 2>as a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Galleon collectivist movement,</v>

1222
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in general,</v>

1223
00:57:49.601 --> 00:57:54.601
<v Speaker 2>that stretches from the early 19th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century all the way up to the present </v>

1224
00:57:54.601 --> 00:57:55.560
<v Speaker 2>that's characterized by love of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictatorship.</v>

1225
00:57:55.561 --> 00:57:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I love of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protectionist trade policy,</v>

1226
00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:01.540
<v Speaker 2>nativist immigration policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an,</v>

1227
00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.580
<v Speaker 2>and a resentment against commercial </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1228
00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Because it's because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1229
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:08.050
<v Speaker 2>it's too heterogeneous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intuit and noble enough humanity.</v>

1230
00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:08.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1231
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:12.820
<v Speaker 2>to me the alt right is one species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say one flavoring,</v>

1232
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.830
<v Speaker 2>one instanciation</v>

1233
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.900
<v Speaker 1>have a much larger problem that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretches way back,</v>

1234
00:58:17.901 --> 00:58:22.370
<v Speaker 1>which isn't in liberal theory of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life in illiberal theory of,</v>

1235
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:23.150
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1236
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:24.350
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1237
00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.120
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1238
00:58:26.121 --> 00:58:31.121
<v Speaker 1>I think the right way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first time I heard trump speak was </v>

1239
00:58:31.121 --> 00:58:34.810
<v Speaker 1>July 2015 and I don't even think we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>using the term right at the time,</v>

1240
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:39.170
<v Speaker 1>but he opened his speech with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1241
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:40.790
<v Speaker 1>immigrants are a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

1242
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:45.910
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there was protection of their </v>

1243
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.910
<v Speaker 1>foreign goods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protectionist when do protection,</v>

1244
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:50.551
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was third big point was I can fix </v>

1245
00:58:50.551 --> 00:58:53.201
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all sounding strangely familiar </v>

1246
00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:53.201
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1247
00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:57.970
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the three pillars of a </v>

1248
00:58:57.970 --> 00:58:58.280
<v Speaker 1>writer Galleon ideology essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1249
00:58:58.610 --> 00:59:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I realized we had a problem and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1250
00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I do where people had a high regard for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1251
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 1>He was going to save us from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the problems that Obama had </v>

1252
00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>

1253
00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:12.950
<v Speaker 1>And God knows those problems and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left has gotten just bonkers,</v>

1254
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:14.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need,</v>

1255
00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:19.960
<v Speaker 1>we need protection from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he introduced his own form of </v>

1256
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.570
<v Speaker 1>problems in the unleashed it's own form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1257
00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:25.620
<v Speaker 1>of dangerous and and potential punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially despotic arrangements of </v>

1258
00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:30.731
<v Speaker 1>power and in some ways are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>insidious because they appealed to </v>

1259
00:59:30.731 --> 00:59:34.270
<v Speaker 1>bourgeoisie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The left has always been a little bit </v>

1260
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:35.900
<v Speaker 1>culturally estranged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1261
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.180
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the mainstream of American life.</v>

1262
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Whereas trump connects very closely with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1263
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.440
<v Speaker 1>This is why fascist movements have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes much more successful than the</v>

1264
00:59:45.441 --> 00:59:46.730
<v Speaker 1>left socialist once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1265
00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:49.400
<v Speaker 1>I gotta I gotta get this because I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have thought the opposite.</v>

1266
00:59:49.401 --> 00:59:54.401
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you would have asked me before you </v>

1267
00:59:54.401 --> 00:59:56.141
<v Speaker 1>said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the left is the one that is </v>

1268
00:59:56.141 --> 00:59:57.971
<v Speaker 1>understood the culture part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the American piece of they </v>

1269
00:59:58.161 --> 01:00:01.700
<v Speaker 1>certainly academia and culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you could and couldn't joke about.</v>

1270
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The left is as high.</v>

1271
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:10.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist ideology never came from </v>

1272
01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:10.330
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was never working.</v>

1273
01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Man's philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was always a mental.</v>

1274
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I was always the intellectuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a top down rule was always the </v>

1275
01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>ruling class that hatched associates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist ideology that never would have</v>

1276
01:00:17.871 --> 01:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>been communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>

1277
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:21.530
<v Speaker 1>all those things without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual class.</v>

1278
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>But fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'll allow me to use that term,</v>

1279
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>a kind of flip scenario to have a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1280
01:00:27.381 --> 01:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>It's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much more of a from below it.</v>

1281
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>You can keep your religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can keep your nationhood,</v>

1282
01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:34.550
<v Speaker 1>your identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your race,</v>

1283
01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>your language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rally around your friends,</v>

1284
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.240
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1285
01:00:38.241 --> 01:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>all the things that you believe are </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

1286
01:00:40.251 --> 01:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>You and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1287
01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1288
01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and within me as a person,</v>

1289
01:00:44.631 --> 01:00:45.530
<v Speaker 1>as a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>

1290
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I will embody all your values and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and collected by as us in a way that </v>

1291
01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.650
<v Speaker 1>that means something important that </v>
<v Speaker 1>connects with who you are.</v>

1292
01:00:55.010 --> 01:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very effective way of being </v>

1293
01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>illiberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright?</v>

1294
01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>So all that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is our way out of this precarious </v>

1295
01:01:07.401 --> 01:01:12.401
<v Speaker 1>position?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I get where I get the theme of </v>

1296
01:01:12.401 --> 01:01:15.851
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing here is we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep fighting for what we've been </v>

1297
01:01:15.851 --> 01:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>thinking better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1298
01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:18.500
<v Speaker 1>so dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to rethink who we are.</v>

1299
01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:23.501
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to deepen and enrich our</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of who we are and what </v>

1300
01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:26.870
<v Speaker 1>we're here to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it goes back centuries.</v>

1301
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:32.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was the liberalism that dog is</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of feudalism that ended the guilds </v>

1302
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>that brought us free trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ended slavery,</v>

1303
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:40.331
<v Speaker 1>that really gave birth to the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and we need to learn to take </v>

1304
01:01:40.331 --> 01:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>credit for that and make that ethos our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethos.</v>

1305
01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Go back and read the works of Adam Smith</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Great Scottish,</v>

1306
01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Scottish enlightenment thinkers.</v>

1307
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1308
01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.420
<v Speaker 1>and understand our history so we </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand ourselves better.</v>

1309
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I think this is important because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to stop thinking of ourselves even </v>

1310
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.750
<v Speaker 1>though we are radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you are.</v>

1311
01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:02.951
<v Speaker 1>I think I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost believe that we should stop </v>

1312
01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>thinking of ourselves that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should think of ourselves as normal.</v>

1313
01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.220
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a radical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the phrase radical,</v>

1314
01:02:07.221 --> 01:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely not as cool as it used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

1315
01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1316
01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm open to these ideas and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess being,</v>

1317
01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>being open right now and being really </v>
<v Speaker 1>living up to the ideals that you said </v>

1318
01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:18.880
<v Speaker 1>fourth year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1319
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:24.380
<v Speaker 1>these days it kind of is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe liberalism has always been a </v>

1320
01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>radical creed because it opposes power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always had been opposed to power.</v>

1321
01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>That's where we have to do now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also have to celebrate regular </v>

1322
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1323
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>we have to.</v>

1324
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>We have to celebrate the good life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful things and the things we </v>

1325
01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.711
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people we love and the choices that </v>

1326
01:02:39.711 --> 01:02:39.711
<v Speaker 1>we can make in the technologies that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can use it.</v>

1327
01:02:39.711 --> 01:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I fall in love with the new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single day I came over,</v>

1328
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I came over to see you with this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny pillow that I bought for $10 on </v>

1329
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Amazon and it allows me to sleep sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and I'm been raptured.</v>

1330
01:02:49.201 --> 01:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the way to happiness and</v>

1331
01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately is the path to </v>
<v Speaker 1>political victory for us to to be,</v>

1332
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>to be more hopeful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more cheerful,</v>

1333
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:03.600
<v Speaker 1>to be more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to celebrate life and celebrate love and</v>

1334
01:03:03.601 --> 01:03:05.120
<v Speaker 1>celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1335
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.280
<v Speaker 1>In a way in which neither left or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right or doing right now.</v>

1336
01:03:08.281 --> 01:03:13.281
<v Speaker 1>It gives us as an opening to be awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to emancipate the world.</v>

1337
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:19.460
<v Speaker 1>We can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing better to do for more </v>

1338
01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:19.460
<v Speaker 1>ride.</v>
