<v Speaker 1>for a guest,</v>

8
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ready to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

11
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>So we have to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Rogan had allowed muskeg last </v>

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last week,</v>

13
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>and they smoked a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you want me to put the joint on </v>

14
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>the table right now or how are we doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

15
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

16
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>my number one rule is never to compete </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the.</v>

17
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I would never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never bet against Ilan.</v>

19
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

20
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.110
<v Speaker 1>it's been like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a close partner of visit paypal in</v>

22
00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>in the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early two thousands and uh,</v>

24
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after pay pal,</v>

25
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elon set out to start these two,</v>

26
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>both the rocket company and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric car company,</v>

28
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:08.200
<v Speaker 1>space x and Tesla.</v>

29
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think the conventional wisdom on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ilan was these were both completely </v>

30
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.401
<v Speaker 1>harebrained projects and if one of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>had succeeded that you have to sort of </v>

31
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>question it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when both of them succeeded,</v>

32
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.350
<v Speaker 1>it's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 1>he knows something people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people don't.</v>

34
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.240
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well on that can be a matter of luck.</v>

35
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep the joint right here for now </v>

36
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>so I can compete with you on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

37
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.051
<v Speaker 1>But let that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good place to start because </v>

38
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:34.051
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:35.710
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because we've gotten to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know each other a little bit in the last</v>

40
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.920
<v Speaker 1>couple of years and it seems to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person that I know privately is sort</v>

41
00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>of different than the way the way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media portrays you.</v>

42
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.890
<v Speaker 1>So I thought maybe at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just do a little history about you</v>

43
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:49.891
<v Speaker 1>and then we can get to some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversies in some of the ideas that </v>

44
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:49.891
<v Speaker 1>you're really interested and things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

45
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:52.390
<v Speaker 1>So let's start with paypal since you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned it already.</v>

46
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Where did the idea of paypal first come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>

47
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's when,</v>

49
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.370
<v Speaker 1>when you start one of these companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's typically not the case that you get</v>

51
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea fully formed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.600
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We certainly,</v>

53
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this incredible internet boom </v>

54
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.090
<v Speaker 1>going on in silicon valley in the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

55
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 1>It felt that there was sort of this open</v>
<v Speaker 1>frontier,</v>

56
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>open gold rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the natural things to look at </v>

57
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.880
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was finance.</v>

58
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I was sort of very interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrency.</v>

59
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Could there be new forms of money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's always something super,</v>

60
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mysterious,</v>

61
00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>important about money.</v>

62
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:32.710
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

63
00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:34.570
<v Speaker 1>it was the way that this was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

64
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:39.571
<v Speaker 1>So we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we had this general idea to do </v>

65
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 1>something with security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with money,</v>

66
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 1>with payments from very early on of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>founding of the company,</v>

67
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and then you iterate a lot on how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get the idea out and the,</v>

68
00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:54.181
<v Speaker 1>the critical question for any consumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet product is always not what the </v>

69
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:55.780
<v Speaker 1>idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do you get it out?</v>

70
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.480
<v Speaker 1>How do you get the distribution out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we spent,</v>

71
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.950
<v Speaker 1>there've been a of payments companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet payments companies that have,</v>

72
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>that are already started and failed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>1998.</v>

73
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.740
<v Speaker 1>There was one called one called a was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cyber cash through or you know,</v>

74
00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

75
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of a variety of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ones that have tried to create</v>

76
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>these comprehensive currency schemes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>and they would work if everybody used </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

78
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>but you can never get even the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>person to start at sort of the challenge</v>

79
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:29.581
<v Speaker 1>was how to make it viral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get something to work where </v>

80
00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:32.700
<v Speaker 1>it's good for the first person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the 10th person to the hundredth </v>

81
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.700
<v Speaker 1>person in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we have millions of people,</v>

82
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you have a network of network effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was sort of the chicken and egg</v>

83
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:41.581
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you guys overcome that hurdle </v>

84
00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:44.370
<v Speaker 1>where we eventually stumbled on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of linking money with email because</v>

85
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>there were ready 300 million people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

86
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:51.361
<v Speaker 1>99 that had email accounts and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you could send money to an </v>

87
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:57.181
<v Speaker 1>email address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send it to your email and then you get </v>

88
00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:00.961
<v Speaker 1>an email saying you've received cash and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd obviously click on the links </v>

89
00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>and do the work necessary to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money out.</v>

90
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.320
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.580
<v Speaker 1>and so you didn't need both counterpart </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a transaction to be part of the </v>

92
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>paypal network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only the sender could be part of it.</v>

93
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>And then the recipient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recipient would sign up as they took</v>

94
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>the money out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

95
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>and then we started with the 24 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our office.</v>

96
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Those were the first 24 customers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they sent money to friends and to other </v>

97
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gave these referral bonuses.</v>

98
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>We gave you $10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You signed up and $10.</v>

99
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>She got someone to sign up and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew exponentially when we were,</v>

100
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:36.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it grew about seven to 10 percent </v>

101
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>compounding daily and if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.990
<v Speaker 1>an image to start with a small number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get seven to 10 percent daily </v>

103
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.961
<v Speaker 1>compounding and after about a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>year to thousand people by those mid </v>

104
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 1>November of 99 by end of December of </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 99,</v>

105
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>it was a $12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>by February third,</v>

106
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>2000.</v>

107
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 1>It was at 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>by mid April,</v>

108
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>2000 goes up to a million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

109
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.770
<v Speaker 1>So what did you do in terms of getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to understand the way you could </v>

110
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.140
<v Speaker 1>work with money differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I actually remember the first </v>

111
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.261
<v Speaker 1>time I used paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in 2001 I was a </v>

112
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>struggling comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had moved into a roommates,</v>

113
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>a little apartment because I didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>much money and I,</v>

114
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>but I had to pay him a couple of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks or something a month for a for </v>

115
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>rent and he was going to give him a </v>
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>

116
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey pal,</v>

117
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>me and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the idea that I was somehow linking</v>

118
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 1>my bank account to something on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

119
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm not mistaken.</v>

120
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I think I was still using dialup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know that we,</v>

121
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

122
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.230
<v Speaker 1>had wifi or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's about an idea that this can </v>

123
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.230
<v Speaker 1>even happen.</v>

124
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>How did you train people to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

125
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>it's always something that's real and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always on.</v>

126
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.510
<v Speaker 1>You normally serve to get people start </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something like that.</v>

127
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>It has to be something where there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense need and um,</v>

128
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.360
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's not too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the know one of the natural </v>

129
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.881
<v Speaker 1>places that started was on the Ebay </v>
<v Speaker 1>auction site where small dollar </v>

130
00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>transactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe $40 with the typical amount.</v>

131
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>And if you send chuck across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

132
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.350
<v Speaker 1>that's like a seven to 10 delay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 day delay.</v>

133
00:06:04.351 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>It's slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

134
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.660
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people aren't set up to process </v>

135
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.821
<v Speaker 1>credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You roommate probably couldn't process </v>

136
00:06:12.821 --> 00:06:12.821
<v Speaker 1>credit cards and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

137
00:06:12.821 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 1>and so unit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But since you could make paypal payments</v>

138
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:19.451
<v Speaker 1>with a credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could in fact send a credit card </v>

139
00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:19.960
<v Speaker 1>payment to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

140
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.090
<v Speaker 1>300 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas they're only something like </v>

141
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.881
<v Speaker 1>three or 4 million that are set up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>process a 150 million people with emails</v>

142
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:33.431
<v Speaker 1>in theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s at the time and there may be $3 </v>

143
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:33.431
<v Speaker 1>million that were set up to process </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit cards,</v>

144
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 1>small businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

145
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.830
<v Speaker 1>So we expanded it by 147 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what it felt like as it </v>

146
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>started compounding the way you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about?</v>

147
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Like what was that like as it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing and you realize like,</v>

148
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really have this.</v>

149
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are at the forefront of some sort of</v>

150
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.040
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

151
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly exciting and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly scary.</v>

152
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:58.871
<v Speaker 1>And it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was going to take over the world are </v>

153
00:06:58.871 --> 00:06:58.871
<v Speaker 1>all going to die and move several times </v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

154
00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>you know that those two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several times a day.</v>

155
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Was there any bizarre pushback from </v>
<v Speaker 1>banks or any anyone that was doing </v>

156
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 1>financial transactions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Traditionally,</v>

157
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 1>there were certainly like more than more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than our share of challenges.</v>

158
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:17.261
<v Speaker 1>You had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had an enormous problem of fraud </v>

159
00:07:17.261 --> 00:07:19.571
<v Speaker 1>where people just figured out ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hack the system and steal money and </v>

160
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:19.571
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

161
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 1>and you can't simply get rid of fraud </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you always get flooded and make </v>

162
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 1>it cumbersome.</v>

163
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.480
<v Speaker 1>If it's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's also easy to defraud your </v>

164
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.110
<v Speaker 1>challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get it to be easy to use but </v>

165
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.110
<v Speaker 1>hard to defraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that took,</v>

166
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.800
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took some time there.</v>

167
00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly a banks didn't like it,</v>

168
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role of the incumbent players that,</v>

169
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:42.010
<v Speaker 1>that didn't like something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course it was sort of in </v>

170
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.010
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

171
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.001
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange regulatory zone where it was a </v>

172
00:07:46.001 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 1>new form of payments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new form of moving money.</v>

173
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.370
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

174
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.490
<v Speaker 1>the way I often thought of it at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time was that we were in a race between </v>

175
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 1>technology and politics and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the politicians didn't like us,</v>

176
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 1>but if we got the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paypal network to be big enough,</v>

177
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:04.210
<v Speaker 1>it would sort of overwhelm the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulators and they'd have to accept </v>

178
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:04.210
<v Speaker 1>that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a fait accompli.</v>

179
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.680
<v Speaker 1>So the Libertarian Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must have love that concept,</v>

180
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:11.681
<v Speaker 1>like you were actually doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that libertarians are supposed to do </v>

181
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:11.681
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

182
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:13.410
<v Speaker 1>There was a early 2000 conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

183
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

184
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.480
<v Speaker 1>one of the execs that paypal said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:18.770
<v Speaker 1>we need to hire a whole bunch of lawyers</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>

186
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.710
<v Speaker 1>We what we can do or can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

187
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>we're not gonna hire them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell us we can't do.</v>

188
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 1>So we have to just go ahead and not hire</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lawyers and just just do it.</v>

189
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 1>the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

191
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

192
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I do not know if a company like paypal </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been started even two,</v>

193
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>three years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

194
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

195
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:40.210
<v Speaker 1>in the aftermath of nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got the Patriot Act in the US and </v>

196
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:40.210
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

197
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 1>that attached,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>much more regulatory scrutiny to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

199
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 1>to financial transactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to payments,</v>

200
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.200
<v Speaker 1>the know your customer rules became </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

201
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>much trickier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

202
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:55.091
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I do think that there's a weird way </v>

203
00:08:55.091 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 1>in which there was an opening to start a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business like paypal in 1999 slash 2000,</v>

204
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 1>even three years later.</v>

205
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it might not have been possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's so cool to me just knowing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of your ideology and the libertarian</v>

207
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:10.071
<v Speaker 1>ideas you care about and just going </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead and building what you want to </v>

208
00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 1>build instead of waiting for other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to do it.</v>

209
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually did it and that's a pretty.</v>

210
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

211
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

212
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of the sense that,</v>

213
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were going to change the world.</v>

214
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 1>give people more control over their </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

216
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 1>We had all these ideas about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

217
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.630
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of central banks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating a new currency.</v>

218
00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 1>We never quite got to the bitcoin stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

219
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

220
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>but certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

221
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.190
<v Speaker 1>certainly these ideas were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 1>were incredibly motivational and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

223
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>And it is always a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrast from,</v>

224
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always have this view on politics </v>

225
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.771
<v Speaker 1>where it's both incredibly important and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then in many ways incredibly frustrating</v>

226
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.280
<v Speaker 1>because it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

227
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like the air we breathe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>permeates our whole system and then it's</v>

228
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 1>also so hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ever change,</v>

229
00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:57.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

230
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 1>as a college student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started you this,</v>

231
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 1>a conservative Libertarian newspaper in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanford,</v>

232
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 1>the Stanford Review and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a lot,</v>

233
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:09.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to have debates to </v>

234
00:10:09.561 --> 00:10:09.561
<v Speaker 1>discuss things and then it's often so </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to,</v>

235
00:10:09.561 --> 00:10:11.790
<v Speaker 1>to change things in the paypal hack was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>

236
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were going to sign the world.</v>

237
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.710
<v Speaker 1>We're going to ask for permission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just tech technology over </v>

238
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.710
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

239
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.790
<v Speaker 1>speaking of changing the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's flash forward a couple of years.</v>

240
00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:25.791
<v Speaker 1>So we're just doing some business </v>
<v Speaker 1>background first before we get to a lot </v>

241
00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:25.791
<v Speaker 1>of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideas of the day.</v>

242
00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.650
<v Speaker 1>You were the first outside investor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

243
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:33.651
<v Speaker 1>500 grand to the Zuckerberg guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know him well before that?</v>

244
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Had you guys communicated a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did that even come to pass?</v>

245
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the sort of actually literally the </v>

246
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.170
<v Speaker 1>first day we met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked for an hour,</v>

247
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 1>we came back and we gave him the term </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheet about an hour later.</v>

248
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:45.680
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how was a,</v>

249
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.750
<v Speaker 1>it was a fast decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.880
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people always have this sort of </v>

251
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.370
<v Speaker 1>shark tank image of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some sort of super sophisticated </v>

252
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.930
<v Speaker 1>pitch and you say just the right things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what works.</v>

253
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 1>And it was nothing of the sort and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was uh,</v>

254
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.020
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.470
<v Speaker 1>kind of introverted 19 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sophomore between sophomore and junior</v>

256
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>summer,</v>

257
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.800
<v Speaker 1>summer of 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

258
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.630
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

259
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:17.631
<v Speaker 1>the main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main thing I had going for it was </v>

260
00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:20.541
<v Speaker 1>just growing fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were something like 20 college </v>

261
00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:20.541
<v Speaker 1>campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had about 100,000</v>

262
00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:25.461
<v Speaker 1>people on the network and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed more money for computers because </v>

263
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:29.691
<v Speaker 1>there was such demand for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the product as they were going to </v>

264
00:11:29.691 --> 00:11:32.001
<v Speaker 1>launch at more colleges in the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that what appealed to you more </v>

265
00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:33.310
<v Speaker 1>than the product itself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that you saw engagement.</v>

266
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.040
<v Speaker 1>It was already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was already working.</v>

267
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

268
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.010
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say the other,</v>

269
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 1>the other part of it was that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a prehistory to it.</v>

270
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:46.041
<v Speaker 1>So one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my good friends from paypal back </v>

271
00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 1>from Stanford guy named Reid Hoffman who</v>
<v Speaker 1>started linkedin later years,</v>

272
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:53.811
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he worked with me at paypal in the </v>

273
00:11:53.811 --> 00:11:53.811
<v Speaker 1>late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early two thousands.</v>

274
00:11:53.811 --> 00:11:57.800
<v Speaker 1>But before that he had started a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>networking company back in 1997,</v>

275
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 1>seven years before facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had,</v>

276
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.520
<v Speaker 1>they already had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

277
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had social net was the name of the </v>

278
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:07.740
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that social networking in the name of</v>

279
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.121
<v Speaker 1>the company seven years before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were all these things that </v>

280
00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:13.540
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had thought about doing.</v>

281
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.740
<v Speaker 1>it was going to be your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the 19 nineties version of social </v>

283
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.101
<v Speaker 1>networking was going to have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>avatars and cyberspace and I might be a </v>

284
00:12:23.101 --> 00:12:24.990
<v Speaker 1>cat and you might be a dog and I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual cat.</v>

285
00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:27.580
<v Speaker 1>You're a virtual dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have to figure out how we relate.</v>

286
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't really interested in that.</v>

287
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 1>They weren't really interested in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of fictional online persona.</v>

288
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 1>It was much more about real identity.</v>

289
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.760
<v Speaker 1>And somehow facebook was the first one </v>
<v Speaker 1>to crack the problem of real identity </v>

290
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.020
<v Speaker 1>where even though it's always a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit curated,</v>

291
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 1>certainly for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on facebook are who they say they</v>

292
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:54.070
<v Speaker 1>are for the most part at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So am I mistaken,</v>

293
00:12:54.071 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 1>you're the only person who's been on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>board of facebook the entire way out,</v>

294
00:12:56.981 --> 00:12:57.930
<v Speaker 1>except for mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

295
00:12:57.931 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

296
00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Since the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

297
00:12:59.151 --> 00:12:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

298
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:05.070
<v Speaker 1>what can I ask you about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that facebook won't get too angry about </v>

299
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 1>if I asked you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

300
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:11.311
<v Speaker 1>it just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the experience like of being a </v>

301
00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:13.270
<v Speaker 1>part of a board from the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>really the thing of the Internet,</v>

302
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 1>what seems to drive conversation the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most on the Internet?</v>

303
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's um,</v>

304
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

305
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's been sort of like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible trajectory,</v>

306
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

307
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.930
<v Speaker 1>where it's gotten probably much bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than I would have thought possible at </v>

308
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:27.930
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

309
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Even though I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was incredibly optimistic and bullish </v>

310
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly back in back in 2004,</v>

311
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 1>2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

312
00:13:35.411 --> 00:13:38.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that one,</v>

313
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.200
<v Speaker 1>one kind of perspective for a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world class entrepreneurs is,</v>

314
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.730
<v Speaker 1>they're not specialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

315
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.010
<v Speaker 1>there's something close to poly maths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

316
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

317
00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:51.580
<v Speaker 1>if you have a conversation with Mark </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg,</v>

318
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.790
<v Speaker 1>he'd be able to speak with a surprising </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of understanding about a lot of </v>

319
00:13:57.551 --> 00:14:02.551
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could speak about the details of the </v>

320
00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:02.551
<v Speaker 1>facebook product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could talk about,</v>

321
00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:02.551
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

322
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 1>the way people think about social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychology,</v>

323
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.350
<v Speaker 1>the way the culture is shifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the management of the company,</v>

324
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.390
<v Speaker 1>his ideas on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ideas on,</v>

325
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:18.391
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then how this fits into the bigger </v>

326
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:20.251
<v Speaker 1>history of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a sort of an academic view </v>

327
00:14:20.251 --> 00:14:25.080
<v Speaker 1>is often that you're like sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow expert on one thing and that's </v>

328
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.801
<v Speaker 1>what you do and what it is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more a sort of polymath like </v>

329
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.800
<v Speaker 1>intellect to understand all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

330
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And the kinds of board conversations </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had over the last 13,</v>

331
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Speaker 1>14 years have just been this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>

332
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be particularly interesting for </v>

333
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.861
<v Speaker 1>you though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as sort of the outsider in silicon </v>

334
00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:49.861
<v Speaker 1>valley and we're going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

335
00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 1>why you moved down to La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff</v>

336
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 2>that you've been there the whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not,</v>

337
00:14:55.191 --> 00:15:00.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't for all the reasons that </v>

338
00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:00.191
<v Speaker 2>silicon valley may be what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You weren't ever booted off the board or</v>

339
00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:01.160
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>

340
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.260
<v Speaker 2>they've let you be the contrarian guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>there so that,</v>

341
00:15:04.261 --> 00:15:09.261
<v Speaker 2>that actually must,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing about silicon </v>

342
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:09.261
<v Speaker 2>valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

343
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 2>or at least within the little microcosm </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you sit in,</v>

344
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:10.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

345
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:11.680
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

346
00:15:11.681 --> 00:15:12.430
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

347
00:15:12.431 --> 00:15:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

348
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.740
<v Speaker 3>a great deal of hostility to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally know people,</v>

349
00:15:17.741 --> 00:15:18.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

350
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.440
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

351
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:21.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

352
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.120
<v Speaker 3>you always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

353
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

354
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of manifests in all sorts of </v>

355
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.961
<v Speaker 3>other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I do think Silicon Valley at this </v>

356
00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:32.971
<v Speaker 3>point has a bit of a conformity problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a bit of a way in which people </v>

357
00:15:33.461 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

358
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.510
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much all thinking the same way.</v>

359
00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:42.540
<v Speaker 3>It's just like the apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw this meme on the Internet the </v>

360
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.330
<v Speaker 3>other day where it was sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Silicon Valley in 1997 colon.</v>

361
00:15:46.331 --> 00:15:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Think different in silicon valley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand 18 colon think the same.</v>

362
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.050
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so there is something that's uh,</v>

363
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:58.190
<v Speaker 3>that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's gone a bit wrong even though I'm </v>

364
00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:58.280
<v Speaker 3>hard pressed to cite things where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

365
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.190
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really affected me personally.</v>

366
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

367
00:16:00.831 --> 00:16:02.950
<v Speaker 2>well I was actually going to push that </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a little bit later,</v>

368
00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:04.450
<v Speaker 2>but let's just stay with that for now </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

369
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see some markers along the way </v>

370
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.261
<v Speaker 2>where you realized some of this group </v>
<v Speaker 2>think was affecting the actual products?</v>

371
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Where were the actual ability to create </v>
<v Speaker 2>new technologies or new products where </v>

372
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.971
<v Speaker 2>that was actually causing stagnation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I sent them,</v>

373
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:29.340
<v Speaker 2>I sent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been sort of a long road to get </v>

374
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.081
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have sort of been talking about </v>

375
00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:33.691
<v Speaker 2>this for awhile now and I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a direct connection to the diversity </v>

376
00:16:33.691 --> 00:16:36.841
<v Speaker 2>myths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we'll also talk about what you </v>

377
00:16:36.841 --> 00:16:36.841
<v Speaker 2>wrote 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

378
00:16:36.841 --> 00:16:36.841
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

379
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.460
<v Speaker 3>I do think Silicon Valley has shifted a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot over over the years.</v>

380
00:16:41.461 --> 00:16:44.610
<v Speaker 3>So when I was an undergraduate at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Stanford in the late 19 eighties,</v>

381
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Stanford was sort of a very liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>politically correct place.</v>

382
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.110
<v Speaker 3>But these silicon valley surrounding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

383
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.380
<v Speaker 3>not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was vaguely libertarian.</v>

384
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

385
00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.300
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a moderate Republican </v>

386
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.961
<v Speaker 3>congressional district and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then sort of by the late nineties I </v>

387
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:04.950
<v Speaker 3>would say to shifted to being sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate,</v>

388
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate Democrat,</v>

389
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.470
<v Speaker 3>which is around the time I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>paypal.</v>

390
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.890
<v Speaker 3>Then if you fast forward another 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

391
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.330
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

392
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.790
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of a pretty hard left.</v>

393
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what there,</v>

394
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:22.530
<v Speaker 2>because it seems to me that if I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking the people that I wanted to be </v>

395
00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:22.750
<v Speaker 2>the most creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most outside of the box,</v>

396
00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:27.751
<v Speaker 2>the most to look at the system and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we fix the system from the </v>

397
00:17:27.751 --> 00:17:30.301
<v Speaker 2>outside?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd want a lot of libertarian </v>

398
00:17:30.301 --> 00:17:32.431
<v Speaker 2>thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way I would at least look at </v>

399
00:17:32.431 --> 00:17:34.591
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd think that everyone in silicon </v>

400
00:17:34.591 --> 00:17:34.900
<v Speaker 2>valley would be pretty libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to do things on their own.</v>

401
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 2>And yet somehow in those 20 years it </v>
<v Speaker 2>became the opposite.</v>

402
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like you only ask the question to </v>
<v Speaker 2>why</v>

403
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it so so loved when I think these</v>

404
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:43.800
<v Speaker 3>things are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

405
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.230
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're somewhat over determined.</v>

406
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.350
<v Speaker 3>So I would say a part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

407
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.370
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

408
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.380
<v Speaker 3>it's probably the most educated part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country in terms of how much time </v>

409
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.431
<v Speaker 3>people spent in college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the downsides of too </v>

410
00:17:58.431 --> 00:17:59.220
<v Speaker 3>much education is that you get the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>brainwashed.</v>

411
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.180
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

412
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 3>it's the most educated can also mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it is,</v>

413
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.890
<v Speaker 3>it is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the most brainwashed,</v>

414
00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

415
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is also true of the founders,</v>

416
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 3>but certainly have many of the rank and </v>
<v Speaker 3>file people who are,</v>

417
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're sort of like a really good </v>

418
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.400
<v Speaker 3>engineer or I'm really good at some </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific thing,</v>

419
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.080
<v Speaker 3>your education typically does not </v>
<v Speaker 3>involve you thinking that much about,</v>

420
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.320
<v Speaker 3>about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not necessarily from deep </v>

421
00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:29.610
<v Speaker 3>ideological conviction.</v>

422
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 3>It's often more as a fashion statement </v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

423
00:18:32.401 --> 00:18:34.110
<v Speaker 3>as a question of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of power.</v>

424
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

425
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:40.090
<v Speaker 3>so one of the things that's always a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit hard to score is that even </v>

426
00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:40.090
<v Speaker 3>though if you took a survey in silicon </v>
<v Speaker 3>valley,</v>

427
00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:40.500
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

428
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 3>it comes out as quite far to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

429
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.720
<v Speaker 3>weirdly uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're sort of group think it's a super </v>

430
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.790
<v Speaker 3>hard to know where the people really </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe this,</v>

431
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.340
<v Speaker 3>whether they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're just going along.</v>

432
00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.730
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's pretty liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

433
00:18:56.731 --> 00:19:01.731
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of course not as liberal as it </v>

434
00:19:01.731 --> 00:19:03.591
<v Speaker 3>looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's way worse because it means </v>

435
00:19:03.591 --> 00:19:04.260
<v Speaker 3>people are too scared to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to articulate things.</v>

436
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.560
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a dinner I had at my house a </v>

437
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560
<v Speaker 3>week before the 2016 election with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group of sort of center,</v>

438
00:19:10.561 --> 00:19:12.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silicon Valley people.</v>

439
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:17.810
<v Speaker 3>One of them was a very prominent angel </v>
<v Speaker 3>investor in Silicon Valley and he said,</v>

440
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm voting for trump in a week,</v>

441
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.570
<v Speaker 3>but because I live in silicon valley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm lying about it.</v>

442
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.940
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

443
00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.520
<v Speaker 3>so are you saying this to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like 12,</v>

444
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.930
<v Speaker 3>12 people up there and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the guy that just the convention,</v>

445
00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 3>he was honest about lying is unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a little bit unusual?</v>

446
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.230
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the way I is,</v>

447
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.130
<v Speaker 3>I tell people I'm voting for Gary </v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnson,</v>

448
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.480
<v Speaker 3>the libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he couldn't,</v>

449
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:47.481
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't quite get away telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that it was voting for Hillary </v>

450
00:19:47.481 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 3>Clinton because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your facial muscles wouldn't work.</v>

451
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.730
<v Speaker 3>And your alignment so small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

452
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Gary Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was sort of what you,</v>

453
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:57.440
<v Speaker 3>what you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think if you sort of looked at </v>

454
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Speaker 3>what happened in the weeks before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>election,</v>

455
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Speaker 3>Gary Johnson support sort of collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all went to trump and the,</v>

456
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:09.201
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question you have to ask is whether </v>

457
00:20:09.201 --> 00:20:12.930
<v Speaker 3>those people just change their minds the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last minute or were they lying all along</v>

458
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.140
<v Speaker 3>or were they wanting to themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think the sort of political </v>

459
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 3>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always bad for thought,</v>

460
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:26.090
<v Speaker 3>but it always makes things appear more </v>
<v Speaker 3>uniform than they are even in Silicon </v>

461
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.090
<v Speaker 3>Valley.</v>

462
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

463
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

464
00:20:26.441 --> 00:20:31.441
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I was going to vote for Gary </v>

465
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:31.441
<v Speaker 2>Johnson and I did vote for Gary Johnson </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as I always say,</v>

466
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I should be judged accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here we are.</v>

467
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:38.350
<v Speaker 2>So this is actually a perfect segue then</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the diversity myth because 20 years </v>

468
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.461
<v Speaker 2>ago you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at Stanford and you saw a lot of </v>

469
00:20:42.461 --> 00:20:44.870
<v Speaker 2>the problems that we are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

470
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you a months ago,</v>

471
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.210
<v Speaker 1>I was listening on Cspan two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a talk you gave about the diversity myth</v>

472
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's from about,</v>

473
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I think at that point it was like 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago or something and I was </v>

474
00:20:58.890 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 1>listening to it and David walked into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the room and he said,</v>

475
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 1>who is that talking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was all true and it was,</v>

476
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.760
<v Speaker 1>he thought it was somebody that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I was listening to the news of </v>

477
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.041
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like somebody's laying out what's going </v>

478
00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:11.041
<v Speaker 1>on today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you saw this,</v>

479
00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:13.540
<v Speaker 1>this issue with multiculturalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fau diversity,</v>

480
00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:17.740
<v Speaker 1>the focus on equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not opportunity.</v>

481
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:21.490
<v Speaker 1>You saw this way before seemingly anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

482
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did that come to be?</v>

483
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

484
00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was certainly.</v>

485
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite a wave of the stuff in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late eighties,</v>

486
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 1>early nineties on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

487
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.120
<v Speaker 1>a number of college campuses and for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons,</v>

488
00:21:34.121 --> 00:21:35.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:36.790
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it crystallized at Stanford.</v>

490
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.780
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this,</v>

491
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.320
<v Speaker 1>there was this super intense debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a western culture which was both a</v>

492
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.570
<v Speaker 1>freshman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one year long freshmen sort of general </v>

493
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:48.970
<v Speaker 1>humanities course where you learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

494
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>western culture history,</v>

495
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then it was a course and the,</v>

496
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:59.330
<v Speaker 1>and the research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesse Jackson showed up to campus one </v>

497
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.330
<v Speaker 1>day and sort of blood this chant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

498
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.630
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ho,</v>

499
00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Ho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>western culture has got to go.</v>

500
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.870
<v Speaker 1>And people were talking about both the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course and of course,</v>

501
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the whole society and culture that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented by that and,</v>

502
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:09.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

503
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

504
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there were a lot of these </v>

505
00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.610
<v Speaker 1>different debates that got a got sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown up.</v>

506
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So is concerned about discriminate </v>
<v Speaker 1>racial discrimination,</v>

507
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:20.580
<v Speaker 1>gender discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

508
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.690
<v Speaker 1>other kinds of people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>victimized.</v>

509
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

510
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:29.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in many cases it felt like it </v>

511
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.891
<v Speaker 1>was this incredible overreach where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were in some sense using their </v>

512
00:22:31.891 --> 00:22:35.461
<v Speaker 1>victim status as a stick with which to </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat other people up or something like </v>

513
00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:35.461
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

514
00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Or we're going to victimize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>victimizers and it's going to be sort of</v>

515
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

516
00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:41.640
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

517
00:22:41.641 --> 00:22:46.641
<v Speaker 1>and so multiculturalism and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness where somehow I'm very </v>

518
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:52.190
<v Speaker 1>linked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The multiculturalism part was we're </v>

519
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.880
<v Speaker 1>gonna give special privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

520
00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to disadvantaged people are in,</v>

521
00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:01.350
<v Speaker 1>some are correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These injustices of the past and the </v>

522
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.351
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intolerant politically correct part </v>

523
00:23:04.351 --> 00:23:07.470
<v Speaker 1>was we were going to go after their </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressors whether they were real or </v>

524
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.930
<v Speaker 1>imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

525
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:09.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in many ways it felt like,</v>

526
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible overreach.</v>

527
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.110
<v Speaker 1>You ended up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

528
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:16.120
<v Speaker 1>with these draconian speech codes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>campus,</v>

529
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

530
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.720
<v Speaker 1>and with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with sort of the humanities in a sense </v>

531
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.420
<v Speaker 1>effectively got gutted in the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties at Stanford though,</v>

532
00:23:23.421 --> 00:23:25.570
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took many years for that to,</v>

533
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fully play out.</v>

534
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.670
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

535
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:33.030
<v Speaker 1>and then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the buzzwords then as now was </v>

536
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:33.030
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

537
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

538
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:35.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

539
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.060
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

540
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I think diversity is a good thing.</v>

541
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I think especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:41.600
<v Speaker 1>diversity of ideas is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

543
00:23:41.601 --> 00:23:43.000
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to be valued,</v>

544
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:48.210
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have real diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have a group of people who </v>

545
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 1>looked different and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and think alike.</v>

546
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.050
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

547
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:53.680
<v Speaker 1>it has to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be more than just a,</v>

548
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just,</v>

549
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:56.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having the extras from the space cantina</v>

550
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:58.910
<v Speaker 1>scene worse or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

551
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

552
00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.280
<v Speaker 1>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's always,</v>

553
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:06.490
<v Speaker 1>that's always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's always like an internal </v>

554
00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.931
<v Speaker 1>critique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The diversity method is that it's not </v>

555
00:24:07.931 --> 00:24:07.931
<v Speaker 1>about diversity at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

556
00:24:07.931 --> 00:24:12.700
<v Speaker 1>it's about conformity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the first time that you had </v>

557
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 1>really staked out what is seemingly an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpopular position?</v>

558
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Although I think actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in 2018 is,</v>

559
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.510
<v Speaker 1>is quite a popular position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's thought of as,</v>

560
00:24:21.511 --> 00:24:24.260
<v Speaker 1>as out there was that the first time you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would publicly,</v>

561
00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:29.261
<v Speaker 1>because nobody wants to be the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>says this stuff and then immediately is </v>

562
00:24:29.261 --> 00:24:29.940
<v Speaker 1>going to be called a racist and a bigot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a homophobia.</v>

563
00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.940
<v Speaker 1>All those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had you ever done anything like that </v>

564
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:34.940
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

565
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

566
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably,</v>

567
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:38.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

568
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to know how far to go back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the autobiographical history or how good</v>

569
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I am at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

570
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.370
<v Speaker 1>but probably already in a junior high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

571
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:47.540
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

572
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

573
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:54.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would take the positions that I </v>

574
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.961
<v Speaker 1>believed in and they wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't necessarily be the </v>

575
00:24:55.961 --> 00:24:56.420
<v Speaker 1>majority of positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was,</v>

576
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

577
00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in junior high school I was totally </v>

578
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 1>against struggle legalization of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort and that was a minority.</v>

579
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 1>That was a minority view or A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I supported Reagan in 1980.</v>

580
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.250
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

581
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:16.470
<v Speaker 1>we were sort of in a relatively liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>area and that was against sort of a </v>

582
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.470
<v Speaker 1>minority view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

583
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.480
<v Speaker 1>so I think I would have had a w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say like extreme outlier </v>

584
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

585
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:22.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

586
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:27.191
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought that it was </v>

587
00:25:27.191 --> 00:25:27.191
<v Speaker 1>important to think for yourself.</v>

588
00:25:27.191 --> 00:25:28.940
<v Speaker 1>So when you wrote the book and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>started talking about these issues,</v>

589
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:33.941
<v Speaker 1>what kind of pushback did you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that I think is the core issue </v>

590
00:25:33.941 --> 00:25:36.320
<v Speaker 1>that most of my viewers are identifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these days,</v>

591
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:38.420
<v Speaker 1>that they're taking positions that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

592
00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:41.390
<v Speaker 1>that don't mean that they're racist or </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigots or homophobes,</v>

593
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.720
<v Speaker 1>but that they mean they care about more </v>
<v Speaker 1>about diversity of ideas then diversity </v>

594
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 1>of skin color or those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

595
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:52.100
<v Speaker 1>and they're scared to say those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet you were doing it a long time </v>

596
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:52.880
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

597
00:25:52.881 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

598
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always,</v>

599
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:57.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always a very tricky thing.</v>

600
00:25:57.231 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

601
00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:58.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

602
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:04.210
<v Speaker 1>on some level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on some level the way we've just </v>

603
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.780
<v Speaker 1>been talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't that many people who will,</v>

604
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.640
<v Speaker 1>who will go out of their way to disagree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with us.</v>

605
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.170
<v Speaker 1>So people know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want people.</v>

606
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some people,</v>

607
00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:12.950
<v Speaker 1>but most people would say find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No we don't,</v>

608
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want any different views are,</v>

609
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to suppress views.</v>

610
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:17.990
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people say that,</v>

611
00:26:17.991 --> 00:26:19.460
<v Speaker 1>but not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really that many.</v>

612
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mask it in other ways,</v>

613
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:22.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to outright say then.</v>

614
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.490
<v Speaker 1>But then in practice you end up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

615
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>

616
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this incredible conformity,</v>

617
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.320
<v Speaker 1>even though that's not in theory with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

618
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Would people want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>

619
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:37.220
<v Speaker 1>one of the professors I studied under </v>
<v Speaker 1>stanford is Rene Girard,</v>

620
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:42.221
<v Speaker 1>is for a cultural critic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philosopher a literary theorist is </v>

621
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:47.530
<v Speaker 1>really brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he sort of always had this theory </v>

622
00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:48.510
<v Speaker 1>that people imitate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They copy each other,</v>

623
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:53.511
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're much more prone to fashion and </v>

624
00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:53.511
<v Speaker 1>things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

625
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 1>one of them he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was from France.</v>

626
00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.800
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the metaphors he had for a lot of</v>

627
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:03.801
<v Speaker 1>the sort of more politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors at Stanford was that they all</v>

628
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:06.780
<v Speaker 1>thought they were in the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance,</v>

629
00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they had lived in vichy France,</v>

630
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:12.380
<v Speaker 1>they would have all been collaborators </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

631
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the,</v>

632
00:27:13.581 --> 00:27:18.581
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self understanding people have is </v>

633
00:27:18.581 --> 00:27:20.931
<v Speaker 1>that they're super courageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent thinkers and that's why they</v>

634
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.900
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that they would have been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the resistance in France.</v>

635
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.140
<v Speaker 1>But then in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ask them what the views are that </v>

636
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.591
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same as everybody else around </v>

637
00:27:33.591 --> 00:27:33.591
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

638
00:27:33.591 --> 00:27:33.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

639
00:27:33.591 --> 00:27:34.620
<v Speaker 1>And you have to always ask if everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the same views.</v>

640
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:39.770
<v Speaker 1>It can mean one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can mean that you've reached the </v>

641
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:40.740
<v Speaker 1>absolute truth or it can mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

642
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.830
<v Speaker 1>that you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this sort of incredible </v>

643
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.830
<v Speaker 1>conformity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

644
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting</v>

645
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:50.270
<v Speaker 2>because he was talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance in France and now we have a </v>

646
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.270
<v Speaker 2>group of people in America that think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're part of the resistance.</v>

647
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.850
<v Speaker 2>And I suspect that if they were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

648
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:59.180
<v Speaker 2>they would be treating the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were the resistance of them much worse </v>

649
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 2>than they're being treated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

650
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

651
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

652
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I've thought that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reward critique could also apply to </v>

653
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:06.420
<v Speaker 1>them that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

654
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:06.420
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

655
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by identifying yourself as part of some </v>

656
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:15.440
<v Speaker 1>mob like resistance movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're suggesting the exact opposite.</v>

657
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:16.960
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

658
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it counts,</v>

659
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political views,</v>

660
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect,</v>

661
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

662
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I think there are people can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>sincere views even if they're in the </v>

663
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:29.270
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

664
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.230
<v Speaker 1>it's impressive if you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority.</v>

665
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.920
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're speaking out against president</v>

666
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:39.921
<v Speaker 1>trump in your small town in Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to think that if you're,</v>

667
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.730
<v Speaker 1>if you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in San Francisco or Manhattan,</v>

668
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

669
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.750
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're part of the resistance,</v>

670
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.280
<v Speaker 1>I suspect something very different is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

671
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.440
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a different way of getting at this </v>

672
00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:56.900
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

673
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.910
<v Speaker 1>in a democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always think the majority is right.</v>

674
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's 51,</v>
<v Speaker 1>49,</v>

675
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.790
<v Speaker 1>51 probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

676
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.620
<v Speaker 1>If it's a big majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even more,</v>

677
00:29:04.621 --> 00:29:07.410
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 70 slash 30 even even more,</v>

678
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:09.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's 100 to zero,</v>

679
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.870
<v Speaker 1>99 to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>

680
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.710
<v Speaker 1>that's where we start to suspect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not a democracy,</v>

681
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:21.711
<v Speaker 1>but we're in North Korea or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something's gone wrong with them voting </v>

682
00:29:21.711 --> 00:29:24.801
<v Speaker 1>machine or something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when we have these sort of </v>

683
00:29:24.801 --> 00:29:27.870
<v Speaker 1>hothouse environments at places like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanford or,</v>

684
00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:32.871
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or silicon valley where you have this </v>

685
00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:36.390
<v Speaker 1>complete uniformity of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing you have to suspect,</v>

686
00:29:36.391 --> 00:29:39.030
<v Speaker 1>this is not the wisdom of crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that everyone's figured out the</v>

687
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:40.980
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a madness of crowds.</v>

688
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 1>It some psychosocial insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

689
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:47.500
<v Speaker 1>And this seems to be directly linked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on on our campuses today,</v>

690
00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:48.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

691
00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:53.011
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if 20 years ago you had been thinking </v>

692
00:29:53.011 --> 00:29:55.051
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think your prediction would have </v>

693
00:29:55.051 --> 00:29:55.051
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

694
00:29:55.051 --> 00:29:55.800
<v Speaker 1>we'll be able to break these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that the,</v>

695
00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:01.190
<v Speaker 1>the class of teachers and professors may</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be so addicted to it seems to have </v>

696
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:06.250
<v Speaker 1>come back with a vengeance on oncology </v>
<v Speaker 1>or even even,</v>

697
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radicalized further.</v>

698
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:08.800
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

699
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:09.350
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

700
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.870
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

701
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of like,</v>

702
00:30:12.131 --> 00:30:12.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

703
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:13.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

704
00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't want always psychologize </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you disagree with,</v>

705
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:22.051
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question when you look at what's </v>

706
00:30:22.051 --> 00:30:23.020
<v Speaker 1>happening on campuses or in various </v>
<v Speaker 1>places is always,</v>

707
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.900
<v Speaker 1>is this really what people think or is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

708
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 1>are they just under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

709
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:29.070
<v Speaker 1>incredible peer pressure to fit in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

710
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that as a bizarre direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to the way many other </v>

711
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.240
<v Speaker 1>institutions seem to be crumbling now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way people don't trust the media the</v>

712
00:30:37.241 --> 00:30:40.420
<v Speaker 1>way they used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that we're just seeing sort of a</v>

713
00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

714
00:30:41.021 --> 00:30:46.021
<v Speaker 1>alon on Rogan last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting here today the way that </v>

715
00:30:46.021 --> 00:30:49.291
<v Speaker 1>people want different conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to sit here for as long as </v>

716
00:30:49.291 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 1>it takes to do all the people can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

717
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.150
<v Speaker 1>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can see through,</v>

718
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manufactured consent.</v>

719
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:56.350
<v Speaker 1>They can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

720
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

721
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have conformity and it,</v>

722
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 1>and it looks real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's powerful.</v>

723
00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:04.840
<v Speaker 1>If it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's conformity and people sense that</v>

724
00:31:04.841 --> 00:31:06.310
<v Speaker 1>it's forced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

725
00:31:06.311 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot shakier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

726
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.340
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

727
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:10.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what the right metaphor is,</v>

728
00:31:10.961 --> 00:31:15.961
<v Speaker 1>but it's like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's like the wizard of Oz where </v>

729
00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:19.291
<v Speaker 1>you have the man behind the curtain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at the man behind the </v>

730
00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:22.291
<v Speaker 1>curtain on the Internet and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it doesn't quite work and you </v>

731
00:31:22.291 --> 00:31:22.291
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

732
00:31:22.291 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I think our sort of media political </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine,</v>

733
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:29.610
<v Speaker 1>maybe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it always worked when people </v>

734
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:31.261
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you sort of see what's going </v>

735
00:31:31.261 --> 00:31:31.930
<v Speaker 1>on in sausage making factory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.210
<v Speaker 1>you might not want to eat as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>sausage anymore.</v>

737
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

738
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>well this is clearly going to be a theme</v>
<v Speaker 1>to almost everything else we talk about.</v>

739
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:42.751
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's sort of catch up to where you are </v>

740
00:31:42.751 --> 00:31:42.751
<v Speaker 1>today and then we're going to go back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that stuff.</v>

741
00:31:42.751 --> 00:31:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a little bit about pallet here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

742
00:31:44.351 --> 00:31:46.510
<v Speaker 1>this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was another company I started,</v>

743
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

744
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2004.</v>

745
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

746
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the big picture,</v>

747
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.080
<v Speaker 1>the big picture of pay pal was sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionized money and payments,</v>

748
00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.560
<v Speaker 1>the big picture for pound Chins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like in the wake of nine slash </v>

749
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.181
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few years after that was could one do </v>

750
00:32:06.181 --> 00:32:10.801
<v Speaker 1>something from a libertarian or civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberties point of view that would still</v>

751
00:32:11.651 --> 00:32:14.900
<v Speaker 1>be tough on terrorism and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

752
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.960
<v Speaker 1>and things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

753
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.500
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of a sort of sense I had was </v>

754
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:22.500
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

755
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.640
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we were going with just,</v>

756
00:32:24.641 --> 00:32:29.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous airport security checks and </v>

757
00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:31.660
<v Speaker 1>super intrusive surveillance all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

758
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:36.870
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really making us safer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was sort of your answer to the </v>

759
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Patriot Act in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way this was sort of like,</v>

760
00:32:38.221 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had the ridiculous</v>

761
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.270
<v Speaker 3>lines at airports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd been through all the ways that,</v>

762
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

763
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:46.250
<v Speaker 3>the response,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

764
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

765
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 3>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was a question,</v>

766
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:51.470
<v Speaker 3>was there some way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was there some technological fix?</v>

767
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:51.760
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

768
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways I often think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology is that it's a way to do more</v>

769
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:58.730
<v Speaker 3>with less and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

770
00:32:58.731 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

771
00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get,</v>

772
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

773
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:06.551
<v Speaker 3>you can get more energy for less money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like an energy innovation or </v>

774
00:33:06.551 --> 00:33:10.120
<v Speaker 3>cleaner energy for less pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

775
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:15.580
<v Speaker 3>more energy that pollutes less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be like a technical or </v>

776
00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:16.850
<v Speaker 3>technology innovation and clean energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the security space,</v>

777
00:33:16.851 --> 00:33:19.340
<v Speaker 3>the doing more with less is something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

778
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is something like more security with </v>

779
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:25.850
<v Speaker 3>less intrusion on people's civil </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberties.</v>

780
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.940
<v Speaker 3>And that's kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of the tradeoff that you </v>

781
00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.391
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that the non non-technological </v>

782
00:33:34.391 --> 00:33:37.301
<v Speaker 3>debate that we had in the U,</v>
<v Speaker 3>s and 2004 in any ways that we still </v>

783
00:33:37.301 --> 00:33:39.320
<v Speaker 3>have in 2018 is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is always,</v>

784
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always,</v>

785
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.540
<v Speaker 3>you do more with more versus less with </v>
<v Speaker 3>less.</v>

786
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.710
<v Speaker 3>And so you can have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

787
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 3>the neo-con I'm Cheney version,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

788
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:52.140
<v Speaker 3>would be that we're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

789
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.870
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have more security with </v>
<v Speaker 3>more civil liberties violations.</v>

790
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.720
<v Speaker 3>And then you can sort of say that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>equally,</v>

791
00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:04.721
<v Speaker 3>luddite a clu would say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have fewer civil </v>

792
00:34:06.681 --> 00:34:08.930
<v Speaker 3>liberties violations and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have less security.</v>

793
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

794
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:15.290
<v Speaker 3>and that's kind of the way the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological debate gets framed.</v>

795
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Now I am sympathetic to the Hclu on </v>
<v Speaker 3>civil liberties,</v>

796
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 3>but I think they will always lose that </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate because,</v>

797
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:26.351
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you preserve civil liberties is </v>

798
00:34:26.351 --> 00:34:26.351
<v Speaker 3>not to have terrorist attacks because </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get a terrorist attack,</v>

799
00:34:26.351 --> 00:34:28.750
<v Speaker 3>you get the Patriot Act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

800
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:33.870
<v Speaker 3>if the World Trade Center would erode </v>
<v Speaker 3>civil liberties as much as it did in </v>

801
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:38.141
<v Speaker 3>2001,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even want to think what would </v>

802
00:34:38.141 --> 00:34:38.141
<v Speaker 3>happen if you had another terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 3>attack.</v>

803
00:34:38.141 --> 00:34:39.810
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to prevent it to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

804
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.600
<v Speaker 3>to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop erosion.</v>

805
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.610
<v Speaker 3>What pound here does is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

806
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:45.890
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

807
00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:46.630
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

808
00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.010
<v Speaker 3>it sort of is a way for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

809
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:50.600
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

810
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:56.470
<v Speaker 3>for know patterns and data to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>visualized through a combination of </v>

811
00:34:56.841 --> 00:34:59.540
<v Speaker 3>computers and human analysts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

812
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:00.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

813
00:35:00.951 --> 00:35:05.951
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then in a way that doesn't simply </v>

814
00:35:05.951 --> 00:35:07.310
<v Speaker 3>scour the planet and get all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that everybody.</v>

815
00:35:07.311 --> 00:35:12.311
<v Speaker 3>So it's just if there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspicious then you look some more and </v>

816
00:35:12.311 --> 00:35:15.950
<v Speaker 3>so there's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a natural product you build </v>

817
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.300
<v Speaker 3>before you investigate people and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sense it's,</v>

818
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:22.440
<v Speaker 3>it's way less intrusive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this a tough position to hold just </v>

819
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 3>because people theme all too eager to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give up their civil liberties.</v>

820
00:35:24.681 --> 00:35:29.681
<v Speaker 3>Like we always want easy answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I think the Patriot Act </v>

821
00:35:29.681 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 3>passed with two dissenting votes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not mistaken,</v>

822
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:35.030
<v Speaker 3>that people don't really react so </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally all the time.</v>

823
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.350
<v Speaker 3>And especially after a time like </v>
<v Speaker 3>September 11th,</v>

824
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 3>we were really,</v>

825
00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I think out of whack individually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectively that you can come in with a</v>

826
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.680
<v Speaker 1>more sane answer and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand civil liberties and I don't</v>

827
00:35:46.681 --> 00:35:51.681
<v Speaker 1>want big government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want us all to be safe and that </v>

828
00:35:51.681 --> 00:35:53.640
<v Speaker 1>that's almost doesn't ring for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they just want the easy answer.</v>

829
00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:55.560
<v Speaker 1>They want the bumper sticker answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

830
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.080
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

831
00:35:57.081 --> 00:35:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the easiest sell,</v>

832
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.510
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

833
00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I think there is certainly a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness today about how much civil </v>

834
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.590
<v Speaker 1>rights have been eroded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

835
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:11.220
<v Speaker 1>how we're living in a surveillance state</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time and how,</v>

836
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply uncomfortable that is on,</v>

837
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.820
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on so many levels.</v>

838
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

839
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

840
00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:20.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

841
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I think certainly if it worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

842
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.750
<v Speaker 1>if the luddite heavy handed approaches </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually worked,</v>

843
00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:34.060
<v Speaker 1>then I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would be more tolerant and then </v>

844
00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.830
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of a sense that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even,</v>

845
00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 1>they don't even work.</v>

846
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Is it hard to define what work even </v>
<v Speaker 1>means because something could say work </v>

847
00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.631
<v Speaker 1>for three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure everybody's safe even if it's </v>

848
00:36:44.631 --> 00:36:45.030
<v Speaker 1>violating all sorts of personal privacy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>

849
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:46.380
<v Speaker 1>But then if there's an attack then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

850
00:36:46.381 --> 00:36:51.381
<v Speaker 1>well it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what work means you prevent </v>

851
00:36:51.381 --> 00:36:51.381
<v Speaker 1>terrorist attacks from happening in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the narrow,</v>

852
00:36:51.381 --> 00:36:52.520
<v Speaker 1>narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just about the,</v>

853
00:36:52.521 --> 00:36:55.560
<v Speaker 1>the window that it works basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the second it doesn't work,</v>

854
00:36:55.561 --> 00:36:58.080
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work and well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

855
00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:03.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how many you prevent that would </v>

856
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:03.340
<v Speaker 1>have otherwise happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

857
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:03.340
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

858
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.340
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if it works perfectly friend,</v>

859
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.800
<v Speaker 1>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it works pretty well,</v>

860
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:09.690
<v Speaker 1>prevents most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

861
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:14.870
<v Speaker 1>So this must be a little bit of a tricky</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation for you because you obviously </v>

862
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:15.750
<v Speaker 1>have to work with the government on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff.</v>

863
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure that that's probably not </v>

864
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.750
<v Speaker 1>thrilling for you at some level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

865
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

866
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

867
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

868
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

869
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

870
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:28.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

871
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I believe you can be both a libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

872
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:36.510
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and work with the government or even </v>

873
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 1>work for the government or work in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

874
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

875
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.370
<v Speaker 1>and even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you believe that there should be</v>

876
00:37:41.371 --> 00:37:43.860
<v Speaker 1>a much smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less intrusive government,</v>

877
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.190
<v Speaker 1>you can still try to work to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>function better.</v>

878
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And so there's both an outside and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside game.</v>

879
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know there's all these versions like </v>

880
00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:55.160
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like if you're a libertarian,</v>

881
00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.180
<v Speaker 1>should you refuse to take a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>security check and a,</v>

882
00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:00.390
<v Speaker 1>well you can be against social security </v>
<v Speaker 1>and still personally collect a check.</v>

883
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I ran to security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

884
00:38:03.021 --> 00:38:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a libertarian,</v>

885
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.240
<v Speaker 1>should you refuse to be a public school </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher because you're a,</v>

886
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.450
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe,</v>

887
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's actually better to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>public school teacher rather than some </v>

888
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.180
<v Speaker 1>socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person who will otherwise get it up by</v>

889
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:15.630
<v Speaker 1>default.</v>

890
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:16.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

891
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

892
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

893
00:38:18.061 --> 00:38:23.061
<v Speaker 1>I think we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can have certain kinds of principles </v>

894
00:38:23.061 --> 00:38:23.640
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then act and pragmatic ways and this</v>

895
00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:26.160
<v Speaker 1>isn't necessarily hypocrisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You once said to me,</v>

896
00:38:26.161 --> 00:38:27.780
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure you've said it to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

897
00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:29.970
<v Speaker 1>that I wouldn't be a libertarian if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked.</v>

898
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you sort of picture a moment or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember a moment where you think </v>

899
00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess basically big government stopped</v>

900
00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:40.390
<v Speaker 1>working because it didn't work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile,</v>

901
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.290
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

902
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in our lifetimes,</v>

903
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 1>not are not very well in our lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

904
00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:46.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

905
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.840
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to see with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

906
00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.500
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the benefit of hindsight.</v>

907
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:51.420
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

908
00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think,</v>

909
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:53.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

910
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.050
<v Speaker 1>when I was in college in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

911
00:38:56.051 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that libertarianism was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a timeless and eternal thing.</v>

912
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 1>It was just these absolute truths for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all time,</v>

913
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.120
<v Speaker 1>all places in all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>

914
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:08.770
<v Speaker 1>I've now come to think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be sort of,</v>

915
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.950
<v Speaker 1>there are certain contexts where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more true or less true.</v>

916
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:17.370
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have incredibly well functioning </v>

917
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:23.640
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political institutions are sort of less </v>

918
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.361
<v Speaker 1>of a need for libertarianism in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties or 19 sixties when a state of </v>

919
00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:31.570
<v Speaker 1>California had first rate public schools</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the board.</v>

920
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you said,</v>

921
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:37.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government can't do anything in the </v>

922
00:39:37.951 --> 00:39:37.951
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools can't work.</v>

923
00:39:37.951 --> 00:39:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It might have been problems with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that argument has gotten a lot less </v>

924
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.780
<v Speaker 1>traction than it would today in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

925
00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Because you would be the utopian person </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that point,</v>

926
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

927
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Or You'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be,</v>

928
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 1>you'd be too pessimistic because </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously things,</v>

929
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.660
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things weren't that,</v>

930
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.840
<v Speaker 1>of course your theory on that.</v>

931
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.580
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and certainly,</v>

932
00:39:54.581 --> 00:39:57.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in the military context we had a,</v>

933
00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.510
<v Speaker 1>we had the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

934
00:39:59.010 --> 00:39:59.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

935
00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.800
<v Speaker 1>the atom bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had the Manhattan project,</v>

936
00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:07.720
<v Speaker 1>we had the Apollo space program in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 sixties where you've got a man on the</v>

937
00:40:07.721 --> 00:40:12.721
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you said government can't do </v>

938
00:40:12.721 --> 00:40:12.721
<v Speaker 1>anything that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

939
00:40:12.721 --> 00:40:13.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that felt somewhat wrong.</v>

940
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Now I now I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the thing if we were on us,</v>

941
00:40:17.051 --> 00:40:18.590
<v Speaker 1>and this is always the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

942
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:24.030
<v Speaker 1>somewhat disturbing thing is that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>government works much less well than it </v>

943
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.030
<v Speaker 1>used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

944
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so that's my question.</v>

945
00:40:26.681 --> 00:40:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you do look at a moment where that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

946
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:33.710
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think libertarianism started probably </v>

947
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.940
<v Speaker 1>failing in the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

948
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.610
<v Speaker 1>in a serious way maybe really building </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in various ways.</v>

949
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:38.050
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

950
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:43.500
<v Speaker 1>and libertarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Libertarian party in the US started </v>

951
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.620
<v Speaker 1>in the early seventies and it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense because there was sort of </v>

952
00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:50.551
<v Speaker 1>more of an opening and so it was more </v>
<v Speaker 1>true then than it had been before.</v>

953
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:55.920
<v Speaker 1>And I would argue that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is much more true in 2018 than it was</v>

954
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:58.450
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago,</v>

955
00:40:58.890 --> 00:40:59.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

956
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

957
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:06.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the books were written in the 19 </v>

958
00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:06.420
<v Speaker 1>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

959
00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.410
<v Speaker 1>it felt like it was crazy when I first </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks it was like so bleak,</v>

960
00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:13.340
<v Speaker 1>so pessimistic things were so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

961
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:17.290
<v Speaker 1>so busted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so broken when I first read them in like</v>

962
00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:19.760
<v Speaker 1>the late eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

963
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.540
<v Speaker 1>it still felt pretty crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

964
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:27.620
<v Speaker 1>And then the last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in many ways felt in a much more </v>

965
00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

966
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

967
00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.630
<v Speaker 1>in atlas shrugged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

968
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.550
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to find who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

969
00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:38.060
<v Speaker 1>who is John Galt the clues eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>take them to the state where everything </v>

970
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.950
<v Speaker 1>has gone haywire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the state of Michigan.</v>

971
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.110
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this great company,</v>

972
00:41:42.111 --> 00:41:47.111
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century American Motor Company </v>
<v Speaker 1>was sort of a thinly disguised general </v>

973
00:41:47.111 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 1>motors that had just gone bankrupt.</v>

974
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 1>And it was because we'd be completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>mismanaged along these sort of socialist</v>

975
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.430
<v Speaker 1>kinds of principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Detroit was sort of falling apart.</v>

976
00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Some was farming in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

977
00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.110
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was like 1957,</v>

978
00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.700
<v Speaker 1>was just sort of a crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's,</v>

979
00:42:02.701 --> 00:42:03.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

980
00:42:03.001 --> 00:42:05.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's disturbingly more true today.</v>

981
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

982
00:42:05.451 --> 00:42:07.040
<v Speaker 1>you're on brook who used to be the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

983
00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:12.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ari and I ran institute who I've had on </v>

984
00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:12.220
<v Speaker 1>the show many times and I do some </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking events with.</v>

985
00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:16.600
<v Speaker 1>He always tells me that when he travels </v>
<v Speaker 1>internationally now that it's the </v>

986
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.250
<v Speaker 1>countries that are sort of worse off at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment that are just trying to reset</v>

987
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:24.490
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find those ideas the most interesting </v>

988
00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:24.490
<v Speaker 1>because they're just desperate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

989
00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:28.660
<v Speaker 1>So in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost sounds like you're calling </v>

990
00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.001
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism almost a course </v>
<v Speaker 1>correction for when either capitalism or</v>

991
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.240
<v Speaker 1>not necessary capitalism for when big </v>
<v Speaker 1>government just gets out of control.</v>

992
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Libertarian can come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism can come in and kind of.</v>

993
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the hope.</v>

994
00:42:40.131 --> 00:42:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

995
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these sort of bad bro,</v>

996
00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:49.340
<v Speaker 1>we're chronic things don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't self correct that much and it is </v>

997
00:42:49.671 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 1>probably very hard for there to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>incremental reform from within.</v>

998
00:42:53.001 --> 00:42:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's why something like sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian shock therapy,</v>

999
00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe what you actually maybe what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually need.</v>

1000
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1001
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.360
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one way to think about what,</v>

1002
00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:08.420
<v Speaker 1>what's happened in the US is you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had sort of institutions set up and </v>

1003
00:43:09.501 --> 00:43:13.910
<v Speaker 1>then over time they sort of ossified and</v>
<v Speaker 1>degraded.</v>

1004
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.930
<v Speaker 1>So when NASA was started in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties,</v>

1005
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.590
<v Speaker 1>you had no great scientists that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven,</v>

1006
00:43:21.591 --> 00:43:26.591
<v Speaker 1>motivated and then eventually it became </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of more and more bureaucratic and </v>

1007
00:43:26.591 --> 00:43:30.761
<v Speaker 1>somehow the politics replaced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and we can't reset it or </v>

1008
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:32.330
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>

1009
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I think something like this happens by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way in a lot of the private sector </v>

1010
00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:40.211
<v Speaker 1>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big companies become bureaucratic and </v>

1011
00:43:40.211 --> 00:43:42.851
<v Speaker 1>less functional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the private sector you can have </v>

1012
00:43:42.851 --> 00:43:44.660
<v Speaker 1>new companies get started and if big </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies are too badly run,</v>

1013
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.840
<v Speaker 1>they go broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the government thing for </v>

1014
00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:50.270
<v Speaker 1>government to go broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be incredibly bad.</v>

1015
00:43:50.271 --> 00:43:52.160
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tricky question is always how do</v>

1016
00:43:52.161 --> 00:43:53.990
<v Speaker 1>you course correct before you get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1017
00:43:53.991 --> 00:43:58.991
<v Speaker 1>So do you have a general prescription </v>
<v Speaker 1>for how government and private </v>

1018
00:43:58.991 --> 00:44:03.110
<v Speaker 1>enterprise can work together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a general view on when it is?</v>

1019
00:44:03.111 --> 00:44:08.111
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be what a lot of people </v>

1020
00:44:08.111 --> 00:44:08.111
<v Speaker 1>are talking about right now because I do</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that there is a,</v>

1021
00:44:08.111 --> 00:44:12.130
<v Speaker 1>as I would call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a classical liberal movement </v>

1022
00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:12.980
<v Speaker 1>happening right now or libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement and the question always is well</v>

1023
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.600
<v Speaker 1>when men is the right moment for </v>
<v Speaker 1>government to do more or less,</v>

1024
00:44:17.601 --> 00:44:18.770
<v Speaker 1>depending on which way you look at it.</v>

1025
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1026
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I have a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulaic general answer money.</v>

1027
00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.860
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ideological biases,</v>

1028
00:44:24.861 --> 00:44:29.861
<v Speaker 1>libertarian is that we should have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller government that's less </v>

1029
00:44:29.861 --> 00:44:30.560
<v Speaker 1>intrusive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less regulatory,</v>

1030
00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 1>mostly across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have to tell you exactly</v>

1031
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.270
<v Speaker 1>how small it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should just be,</v>

1032
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:37.500
<v Speaker 1>it should do less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1033
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1034
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:41.000
<v Speaker 1>do we have to privatized roads or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1035
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.090
<v Speaker 1>all this sort of crazy drivers license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to set all the boundaries.</v>

1036
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.810
<v Speaker 1>We know we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>

1037
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 1>lot of room to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big picture,</v>

1038
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.200
<v Speaker 1>and then I think in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>details,</v>

1039
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.790
<v Speaker 1>there are of course always these ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can try to reform things,</v>

1040
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:59.110
<v Speaker 1>try to make things work better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1041
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.520
<v Speaker 1>recognizing that you often have no super</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrenched bureaucracy.</v>

1042
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.970
<v Speaker 1>So if you can shift from public schools </v>
<v Speaker 1>to charter schools,</v>

1043
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:08.250
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of a way to change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy.</v>

1044
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:13.251
<v Speaker 1>If you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could shift things where you </v>

1045
00:45:13.251 --> 00:45:13.251
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1046
00:45:13.251 --> 00:45:15.090
<v Speaker 1>you could fire people or you could shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>down agencies that would probably reform</v>

1047
00:45:15.091 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 1>things quite a bit even though that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's seemingly a very hard lift.</v>

1048
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to hold trump a little bit </v>

1049
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:26.271
<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like this is the right segue </v>

1050
00:45:26.271 --> 00:45:27.420
<v Speaker 1>because there's an interesting piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump that I think a lot of people,</v>

1051
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:31.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot of libertarians are happy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to cutting taxes,</v>

1052
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.900
<v Speaker 1>cutting regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has done a ton of,</v>

1053
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:36.840
<v Speaker 1>and a few other things in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other hand,</v>

1054
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:41.841
<v Speaker 1>it seems that there is a piece of him </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more than happy to do as many </v>

1055
00:45:41.841 --> 00:45:42.990
<v Speaker 1>things by executive action as they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow him to do.</v>

1056
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.200
<v Speaker 1>And maybe in some cases he would try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do things that they wouldn't allow him </v>

1057
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:48.200
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you supported the guy.</v>

1058
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.630
<v Speaker 1>So let's just start there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

1059
00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:54.270
<v Speaker 1>when it was bubbling up in your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were going to support him or at</v>

1060
00:45:54.271 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 1>least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or get you,</v>

1061
00:45:55.531 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 1>gave his campaign money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

1062
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:03.770
<v Speaker 1>what kind of internal discussions were </v>
<v Speaker 1>you having with yourself or were you </v>

1063
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 1>having it with friends and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and colleagues and things like that?</v>

1064
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1065
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1066
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>

1067
00:46:09.691 --> 00:46:10.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would say was,</v>

1068
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:14.520
<v Speaker 1>is I think super important issue for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1069
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.110
<v Speaker 1>and I think should be for libertarians </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally is his foreign policy.</v>

1070
00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:24.090
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that the US should have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>less interventionist foreign policy.</v>

1071
00:46:24.091 --> 00:46:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I believe that we've gotten into too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many stupid wars,</v>

1072
00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the years.</v>

1073
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

1074
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1075
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.830
<v Speaker 1>that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these questions of if the government can</v>

1076
00:46:34.831 --> 00:46:39.831
<v Speaker 1>kill you or in the sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's maybe one of the most intrusive </v>

1077
00:46:39.831 --> 00:46:42.150
<v Speaker 1>forms of government I think really hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1078
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often we do that and um,</v>

1079
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.610
<v Speaker 1>and that there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some need to,</v>

1080
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:49.650
<v Speaker 1>to reset that.</v>

1081
00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:51.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1082
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.420
<v Speaker 1>and so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my point of view,</v>

1083
00:46:54.421 --> 00:46:59.421
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you got someone who's not great on a </v>

1084
00:46:59.421 --> 00:47:01.560
<v Speaker 1>lot of issues but was libertarian on </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy,</v>

1085
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:06.740
<v Speaker 1>that would count for a lot and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had one who's good on a lot of other </v>

1086
00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.750
<v Speaker 1>issues but bad on foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1087
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.340
<v Speaker 1>that would actually eroded in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1088
00:47:11.341 --> 00:47:16.341
<v Speaker 1>And I think the Bush 43 administration </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was also sort of lower tax </v>

1089
00:47:16.341 --> 00:47:20.901
<v Speaker 1>anti-regulatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then because you had the insane war </v>

1090
00:47:20.901 --> 00:47:21.200
<v Speaker 1>in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1091
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.620
<v Speaker 1>and you had to have all these deficits </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you do congressional log rolling.</v>

1092
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.140
<v Speaker 1>And so then you end up with no child </v>
<v Speaker 1>left behind.</v>

1093
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:30.730
<v Speaker 1>You end up with the Medicare part d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

1094
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:31.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1095
00:47:31.171 --> 00:47:34.190
<v Speaker 1>all the sort of crazy expansion of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1096
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.230
<v Speaker 1>of the welfare state as part of the log </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling exercise for,</v>

1097
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.940
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the foreign wars.</v>

1098
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:44.940
<v Speaker 1>And so if we're going to do the anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush 43 and I actually have a smaller </v>

1099
00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:51.241
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the sort of our committee Dan </v>

1100
00:47:51.241 --> 00:47:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Lever for moving that is foreign policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is for us to be,</v>

1101
00:47:53.511 --> 00:47:54.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be less engaged.</v>

1102
00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:56.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1103
00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:57.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

1104
00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:58.060
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1105
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.530
<v Speaker 1>and this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was the place where we're.</v>

1106
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Trump broke the most sharply from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican Orthodoxy in the primaries.</v>

1107
00:48:06.521 --> 00:48:11.521
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who is sort of most opposed </v>

1108
00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:13.591
<v Speaker 1>to Jeb Bush who is somehow represented </v>
<v Speaker 1>in just a continuation of,</v>

1109
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.460
<v Speaker 1>of the war strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had these devastating questions like,</v>

1110
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:18.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1111
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.890
<v Speaker 1>was the Iraq war a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jeb had never thought about it.</v>

1112
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.720
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was an,</v>

1113
00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:31.570
<v Speaker 1>they had never thought about it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had this Washington dc.</v>

1114
00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro war foreign policy bubble and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Clinton's,</v>

1115
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.810
<v Speaker 1>the bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama.</v>

1116
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 1>And maybe moderated a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still got pulled into Syria.</v>

1117
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:44.890
<v Speaker 1>We sort of messed up Libya even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it had been before.</v>

1118
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1119
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:48.200
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1120
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1121
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:51.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think trump represented a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>big break.</v>

1122
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I gave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave to a.</v>

1123
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:54.660
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1124
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I spoke at the convention in Twenty </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen and then I'm also spoken in the </v>

1125
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.670
<v Speaker 1>fall at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1126
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 1>at the Washington Press Club in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches.</v>

1127
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stressed this foreign policy theme,</v>

1128
00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:05.850
<v Speaker 1>so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1129
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.210
<v Speaker 1>it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1130
00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we,</v>

1131
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.560
<v Speaker 1>should we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should the US really be,</v>

1132
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how aggressively should the US be </v>

1133
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.170
<v Speaker 1>involved in Syria and risk a </v>
<v Speaker 1>confrontation with,</v>

1134
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:18.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1135
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:18.760
<v Speaker 1>with Russia.</v>

1136
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.630
<v Speaker 1>And I think trump's instincts continue </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

1137
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:25.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less in this,</v>

1138
00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:28.150
<v Speaker 1>in this sort of super power </v>
<v Speaker 1>confrontation.</v>

1139
00:49:28.151 --> 00:49:33.151
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at where the opposition to </v>

1140
00:49:33.151 --> 00:49:33.151
<v Speaker 1>president trump comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of,</v>

1141
00:49:33.151 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 1>the most deranged part of it is from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neoconservative Republicans because this</v>

1142
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:41.840
<v Speaker 1>is where he's broken the most with </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthodoxy.</v>

1143
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:45.010
<v Speaker 1>We have Russia debate is a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane,</v>

1144
00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.750
<v Speaker 1>the bank that we have like this where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1145
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I think trump has been consistent for 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1146
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 1>We should not have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if Putin's and man,</v>

1147
00:49:56.171 --> 00:50:01.171
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that we should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>risking a nuclear war with Russia sort </v>

1148
00:50:01.171 --> 00:50:05.111
<v Speaker 1>of bag used to be a position of the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way recently as 2012 when,</v>

1149
00:50:05.971 --> 00:50:10.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Romney was hawkish on Russia and </v>

1150
00:50:10.971 --> 00:50:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Obama said the eighties or calling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like.</v>

1151
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:17.070
<v Speaker 1>And then so there's something about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just incredibly crazy how tribal </v>

1152
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:17.110
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1153
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting because that moment </v>

1154
00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:23.940
<v Speaker 1>in the debate between Romney and Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the left was being consistent about </v>

1155
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:28.081
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be looking at Obama now and </v>

1156
00:50:28.081 --> 00:50:28.081
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1157
00:50:28.081 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Speaker 1>you must have been the worst president </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all time because you misjudged that.</v>

1158
00:50:28.521 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 1>And then that led us to our Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet president or something.</v>

1159
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:36.911
<v Speaker 1>But you don't see that side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that sort of consistency </v>

1160
00:50:36.911 --> 00:50:39.290
<v Speaker 1>at anyone these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it feels incredibly deranged.</v>

1161
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:39.700
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1162
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:41.940
<v Speaker 1>but certainly the intuition is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1163
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.490
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't be this fixated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>escalating,</v>

1164
00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:49.240
<v Speaker 1>escalating these potentially military </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex with,</v>

1165
00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:53.050
<v Speaker 1>with places like Russia and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to the extent we have that as,</v>

1166
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:55.490
<v Speaker 1>as the focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it distracts us from,</v>

1167
00:50:55.700 --> 00:51:00.700
<v Speaker 1>from a lot of other things to distracts </v>
<v Speaker 1>us from the very real economic </v>

1168
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.380
<v Speaker 1>competition we have with China and which</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is something we should be taking</v>

1169
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:04.130
<v Speaker 1>more seriously.</v>

1170
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:09.340
<v Speaker 1>And then of course even more importantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe distracts us from mom from are </v>

1171
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:12.560
<v Speaker 1>solving some of the problems at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do think,</v>

1172
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:17.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreign having a less aggressive </v>

1173
00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:20.381
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's maybe the preliminary step to </v>

1174
00:51:20.381 --> 00:51:23.600
<v Speaker 1>getting to then really fixing on solving</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own problems.</v>

1175
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Does that show you how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how derange the conversation has gotten?</v>

1176
00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Because if you listen to conventional </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking on this,</v>

1177
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.090
<v Speaker 1>most of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think trump's critics will say,</v>

1178
00:51:32.091 --> 00:51:34.760
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's saying all these things about North</v>

1179
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Korea or he's making all these threats </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Syria or we drop the mother of all</v>

1180
00:51:38.511 --> 00:51:43.511
<v Speaker 1>bombs or all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're actually making the reverse </v>

1181
00:51:43.511 --> 00:51:43.511
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1182
00:51:43.511 --> 00:51:45.110
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to argue that he's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>the warmonger,</v>

1183
00:51:45.111 --> 00:51:47.570
<v Speaker 1>he's the one that's going to lead us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a world war three.</v>

1184
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:52.870
<v Speaker 1>And really your argument is he's the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the reverse of those things,</v>

1185
00:51:53.181 --> 00:51:54.530
<v Speaker 1>at least for now.</v>

1186
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1187
00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1188
00:51:55.521 --> 00:52:00.521
<v Speaker 1>I think there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a certain type of military </v>

1189
00:52:00.521 --> 00:52:01.730
<v Speaker 1>industrial complex and so there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of this that are sort of almost on</v>

1190
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:03.170
<v Speaker 1>autopilot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1191
00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:03.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1192
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:08.000
<v Speaker 1>but certainly I think all of president </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's instincts are to,</v>

1193
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:09.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1194
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1195
00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:11.170
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1196
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.270
<v Speaker 1>we have to rethink NATO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to rethink,</v>

1197
00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:19.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much we should really be committed </v>

1198
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:19.700
<v Speaker 1>to Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to,</v>

1199
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:23.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't be escalating like crazy </v>

1200
00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:23.310
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Russia.</v>

1201
00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:23.630
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1202
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:28.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the North Korea dictators a </v>

1203
00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:30.500
<v Speaker 1>genocidal maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll talk to him.</v>

1204
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:33.020
<v Speaker 1>So I think the instincts are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1205
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.450
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very powerfully in the,</v>

1206
00:52:35.451 --> 00:52:37.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deescalate Tory side.</v>

1207
00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:42.100
<v Speaker 1>What is it about trump that made you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think this is the guy could do that </v>

1208
00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:46.841
<v Speaker 1>because we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I was hearing you say that you could </v>

1209
00:52:46.841 --> 00:52:46.841
<v Speaker 1>have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1210
00:52:46.841 --> 00:52:49.271
<v Speaker 1>Ron Rand Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing a pretty good job on that </v>

1211
00:52:49.271 --> 00:52:49.271
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1212
00:52:49.271 --> 00:52:50.930
<v Speaker 1>He's been talking about getting out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these wars for a long time.</v>

1213
00:52:50.931 --> 00:52:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when I would watch the debates,</v>

1214
00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:58.991
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like this poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on the stage with the wrong group </v>

1215
00:52:58.991 --> 00:52:58.991
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's making a lot of sense to me.</v>

1216
00:52:58.991 --> 00:53:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I support it.</v>

1217
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:01.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did support Ron Paul,</v>

1218
00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Ron Paul in both 2008 and 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1219
00:53:07.221 --> 00:53:08.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1220
00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I think in some ways a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1221
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:17.110
<v Speaker 1>ran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul was sort of making those arguments </v>

1222
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.360
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think trump made them more </v>

1223
00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.161
<v Speaker 1>powerfully in the 2015 slash 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 1>primaries than even even a rand Paul.</v>

1224
00:53:22.191 --> 00:53:25.730
<v Speaker 1>And to critique rand Paul a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this hit,</v>

1225
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:28.470
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was sort of making this judgment call</v>

1226
00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:30.600
<v Speaker 1>that his dad hadn't been able to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough boats.</v>

1227
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.330
<v Speaker 1>And so he got to be a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1228
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:37.370
<v Speaker 1>less dubbish on foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to be a little bit more agreeable </v>

1229
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:41.060
<v Speaker 1>and of course he didn't end up doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>much less well than his dad because he </v>

1230
00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 1>sort of in a way downplayed what </v>
<v Speaker 1>might've been in one of his best issues.</v>

1231
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.970
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then trump just articulated far more</v>

1232
00:53:47.971 --> 00:53:52.971
<v Speaker 1>powerfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is that x factor thing with </v>

1233
00:53:52.971 --> 00:53:55.611
<v Speaker 1>trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously this was starting to </v>

1234
00:53:55.611 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 1>be like a runaway train and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the momentum was there.</v>

1235
00:53:55.921 --> 00:54:00.921
<v Speaker 1>All the media attention was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes us back to the beginning of </v>

1236
00:54:00.921 --> 00:54:05.001
<v Speaker 1>when we sat down the way you described </v>
<v Speaker 1>paypal when it started really getting </v>

1237
00:54:05.001 --> 00:54:06.390
<v Speaker 1>into that growth phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you must've seen that too.</v>

1238
00:54:06.391 --> 00:54:07.050
<v Speaker 1>And thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1239
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:11.070
<v Speaker 1>the right ideas are kind of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But really what I'm seeing is it's,</v>

1240
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:11.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1241
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you're at least talking about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you're talking about some of the </v>

1242
00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:17.550
<v Speaker 1>important substantive things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be talking about.</v>

1243
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:18.200
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1244
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.760
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1245
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:20.430
<v Speaker 1>part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1246
00:54:20.431 --> 00:54:25.431
<v Speaker 1>part of the negative part is that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrast to how bad and a lot of the </v>

1247
00:54:25.431 --> 00:54:29.631
<v Speaker 1>other people were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met a number of the different </v>

1248
00:54:29.631 --> 00:54:32.931
<v Speaker 1>Republican candidates running in 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a small one on one meetings and I </v>

1249
00:54:33.141 --> 00:54:34.610
<v Speaker 1>think they're like zombies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1250
00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:35.490
<v Speaker 1>and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1251
00:54:35.491 --> 00:54:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you had to do.</v>

1252
00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So the ideological talking points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1253
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:41.910
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of not fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard to,</v>

1254
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:42.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1255
00:54:42.751 --> 00:54:44.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get off script to,</v>

1256
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:49.590
<v Speaker 1>to say anything and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that somehow wasn't,</v>

1257
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.810
<v Speaker 1>wasn't quite what was called for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

1258
00:54:51.811 --> 00:54:56.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something else about Hillary </v>

1259
00:54:56.811 --> 00:54:56.811
<v Speaker 1>Clinton that was very much like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1260
00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1261
00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I think the revisionist history people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to now say is that Hillary Clinton </v>

1262
00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:05.350
<v Speaker 1>was this terrible candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1263
00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was,</v>

1264
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 1>she was the best candidate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment could put up.</v>

1265
00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

1266
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:12.600
<v Speaker 1>the ideas were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't make sense.</v>

1267
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:18.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton thinks she should run </v>

1268
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.170
<v Speaker 1>again in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>

1269
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:20.340
<v Speaker 1>And in a way she's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because from her point of view,</v>

1270
00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I understand why she thinks that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's smarter than the other Democrats,</v>

1271
00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:29.570
<v Speaker 1>she has more experience and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the Zombie Establishment,</v>

1272
00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:35.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still makes more sense for it to be </v>

1273
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:37.110
<v Speaker 1>hillary than someone like cory booker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kamala Harris.</v>

1274
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 1>But the ideas are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas would just become,</v>

1275
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely ossified.</v>

1276
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:46.870
<v Speaker 1>What does it say about sort of the state</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the West that when things are,</v>

1277
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.100
<v Speaker 1>are basically pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to say they're perfect,</v>

1278
00:55:50.101 --> 00:55:55.101
<v Speaker 1>but basically pretty good that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always this feeling that the </v>

1279
00:55:55.101 --> 00:55:57.840
<v Speaker 1>establishment has to be destroyed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>washed away.</v>

1280
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1281
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.190
<v Speaker 1>well we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1282
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:09.630
<v Speaker 1>well that's a big question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's something that goes </v>

1283
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:09.750
<v Speaker 1>back in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1284
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:10.530
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>

1285
00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:16.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about western Western </v>

1286
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.890
<v Speaker 1>civilization that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is perhaps unique is sort of like,</v>

1287
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.500
<v Speaker 1>it's open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1288
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:23.100
<v Speaker 1>it's self referential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self critical.</v>

1289
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1290
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1291
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:26.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1292
00:56:26.321 --> 00:56:31.321
<v Speaker 3>and you don't have the sort of internal </v>
<v Speaker 3>self criticism and in other societies </v>

1293
00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:33.190
<v Speaker 3>and other cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1294
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always,</v>

1295
00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:35.350
<v Speaker 3>there's always an argument that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1296
00:56:35.351 --> 00:56:37.570
<v Speaker 3>ours is an extra stream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really racist,</v>

1297
00:56:37.571 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 3>sexist society discriminates and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of ways.</v>

1298
00:56:41.051 --> 00:56:42.720
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1299
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:44.790
<v Speaker 3>without challenging that for now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1300
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:48.490
<v Speaker 3>you can also say that ours is a society </v>
<v Speaker 3>that cares a lot about racism,</v>

1301
00:56:48.491 --> 00:56:53.491
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the cares a lot about injustices </v>

1302
00:56:53.491 --> 00:56:53.920
<v Speaker 3>that the ways things are not working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think,</v>

1303
00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:59.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think the establishment is not </v>

1304
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:02.791
<v Speaker 3>gotten a free pass in our society for a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a very long time.</v>

1305
00:57:02.831 --> 00:57:05.020
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can say that's,</v>

1306
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:08.080
<v Speaker 3>that's unhealthy and it makes us weak or</v>
<v Speaker 3>divided.</v>

1307
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:08.890
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1308
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.690
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1309
00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:14.200
<v Speaker 3>it's part of the motor that drives our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our civilization.</v>

1310
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1311
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:17.380
<v Speaker 3>maybe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it goes back to,</v>

1312
00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:23.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in sort of the enlightenment or the </v>

1313
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.580
<v Speaker 3>renaissance or um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1314
00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:26.380
<v Speaker 3>the Greco Roman or Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditions.</v>

1315
00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:27.120
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1316
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.430
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Jesus Christ says that he's the son</v>

1317
00:57:30.431 --> 00:57:32.060
<v Speaker 3>of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1318
00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:33.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1319
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.310
<v Speaker 3>you can describe that as a metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious statement,</v>

1320
00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:41.700
<v Speaker 3>but you can also describe it as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>politically atheist statement because </v>

1321
00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:45.870
<v Speaker 3>Caesar Augustus was the emperor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cesar has sort of adopted father,</v>

1322
00:57:46.751 --> 00:57:51.751
<v Speaker 3>had been divinized Caesar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Augustus also claimed to be the son of </v>

1323
00:57:51.751 --> 00:57:53.410
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when Jesus Christ says that he's the</v>

1324
00:57:53.411 --> 00:57:55.870
<v Speaker 3>son of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a challenge.</v>

1325
00:57:55.871 --> 00:57:58.840
<v Speaker 3>The establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an act of political atheism.</v>

1326
00:57:58.841 --> 00:58:03.010
<v Speaker 3>It's the state is not divine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The establishment is not divine.</v>

1327
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:06.100
<v Speaker 3>And that I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>

1328
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:08.110
<v Speaker 3>that's just been part of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

1329
00:58:08.111 --> 00:58:13.111
<v Speaker 3>And I'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be much more worried if people </v>

1330
00:58:13.111 --> 00:58:13.111
<v Speaker 3>stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped,</v>

1331
00:58:13.111 --> 00:58:14.320
<v Speaker 3>stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped asking these questions.</v>

1332
00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for the people that are watching or </v>

1333
00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:21.511
<v Speaker 2>listening to this right now that still </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all the concerns about trump that </v>

1334
00:58:22.211 --> 00:58:27.211
<v Speaker 2>you may or may not have or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or that you feel maybe are somewhat </v>

1335
00:58:27.211 --> 00:58:30.391
<v Speaker 2>deranged in terms of the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've met the guy obviously a bunch of </v>

1336
00:58:30.391 --> 00:58:30.391
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
00:58:30.391 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 2>there's that one video when you guys had</v>
<v Speaker 2>that slightly awkward handshake.</v>

1338
00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1339
00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:40.471
<v Speaker 2>first I guess I have two parts to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is do you have any regrets about </v>

1340
00:58:40.471 --> 00:58:40.900
<v Speaker 2>supporting him or speaking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>convention?</v>

1341
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:42.940
<v Speaker 2>And I want to talk a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that in a minute also.</v>

1342
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also is there something that you can</v>

1343
00:58:45.371 --> 00:58:48.760
<v Speaker 2>impart on us that maybe we don't know or</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not being told,</v>

1344
00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:49.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1345
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:54.841
<v Speaker 2>just from sitting down with the guy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more stable than the way the media would</v>

1346
00:58:55.151 --> 00:58:57.250
<v Speaker 2>portray it or something along those </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>

1347
00:58:57.251 --> 00:58:58.420
<v Speaker 2>We certainly more or less</v>

1348
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:04.080
<v Speaker 3>very smart and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it sort of a common sense intuitive </v>

1349
00:59:04.811 --> 00:59:06.880
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's sort of a way that,</v>

1350
00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:10.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can x Ray people and get an immediate</v>

1351
00:59:10.451 --> 00:59:15.451
<v Speaker 3>read on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on somebody that's incredibly </v>

1352
00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:15.451
<v Speaker 3>impressive.</v>

1353
00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so do you think there's a risk in </v>

1354
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:20.491
<v Speaker 2>that also always relying on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>instinct as opposed to it's why,</v>

1355
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always are risks with these</v>

1356
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.880
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

1357
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:23.900
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1358
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1359
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.330
<v Speaker 3>it's a powerful ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1360
00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:29.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1361
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:31.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there is a degree to which,</v>

1362
00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:35.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has his ideas and um,</v>

1363
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:36.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1364
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:41.500
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's thought these things through for </v>

1365
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:41.840
<v Speaker 3>himself and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the evidence that,</v>

1366
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:43.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not as conformance does that,</v>

1367
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:45.920
<v Speaker 3>is that the ideas are actually pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

1368
00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:46.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1369
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:47.570
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1370
00:59:47.571 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 3>is broken with the Republican Orthodoxy </v>
<v Speaker 3>on foreign policy.</v>

1371
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:52.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's um,</v>

1372
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:55.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rethinking the immigration question,</v>

1373
00:59:55.041 --> 00:59:58.130
<v Speaker 3>rethinking the free trade questions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1374
00:59:58.450 --> 00:59:59.450
<v Speaker 3>and these are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>

1375
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:02.900
<v Speaker 3>these were like not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not mainstream views at all,</v>

1376
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 3>pre 2016 and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there is a way in which,</v>

1377
01:00:06.981 --> 01:00:07.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w what,</v>

1378
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:12.130
<v Speaker 3>what I think has been even more </v>
<v Speaker 3>impressive than I would have expected is</v>

1379
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:14.210
<v Speaker 3>the degree to which the debate has </v>
<v Speaker 3>shifted.</v>

1380
01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.800
<v Speaker 3>And so if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we take the,</v>

1381
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.700
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1382
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.390
<v Speaker 3>the debate about free trade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1383
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:23.410
<v Speaker 3>the consensus in 2015 would have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>free trade is simply good in all times </v>

1384
01:00:24.441 --> 01:00:27.590
<v Speaker 3>in all places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't understand that,</v>

1385
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:29.990
<v Speaker 3>then you didn't study econ one and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1386
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a low Iq person.</v>

1387
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:36.700
<v Speaker 3>End of argument and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and at this point it's much closer to </v>

1388
01:00:37.591 --> 01:00:37.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1389
01:00:37.761 --> 01:00:42.761
<v Speaker 3>there's obviously something just very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very wrong with a lot of the trade </v>

1390
01:00:42.761 --> 01:00:43.140
<v Speaker 3>arrangements in the world and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1391
01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>

1392
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:45.140
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1393
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:50.030
<v Speaker 3>we import $475,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year from China.</v>

1394
01:00:50.031 --> 01:00:55.031
<v Speaker 3>We export $100 million a year to China </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's completely unbalanced and it's </v>

1395
01:00:56.190 --> 01:01:01.190
<v Speaker 3>actually not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we had a genuinely globalizing world </v>

1396
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 3>that's not the way it would look at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a globalizing world,</v>

1397
01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1398
01:01:03.231 --> 01:01:08.231
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less developed parts of the world </v>

1399
01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:10.421
<v Speaker 3>would grow faster and therefore capital </v>
<v Speaker 3>should flow to those parts and therefore</v>

1400
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:17.380
<v Speaker 3>we should have a trade surplus with </v>
<v Speaker 3>China that we get extra capital that we </v>

1401
01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.790
<v Speaker 3>then export through.</v>

1402
01:01:18.790 --> 01:01:23.790
<v Speaker 3>In a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're almost making a globalist </v>

1403
01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:25.640
<v Speaker 3>argument for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though he's always against the </v>

1404
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:25.760
<v Speaker 3>global a little differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

1405
01:01:25.761 --> 01:01:30.500
<v Speaker 3>I would say that I would say that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible trade imbalances tell us that</v>

1406
01:01:30.501 --> 01:01:35.501
<v Speaker 3>something's completely wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of pollyannish globalization story </v>

1407
01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:40.691
<v Speaker 3>were told of Chinese peasants saving </v>
<v Speaker 3>money and it's being sent upstream into </v>

1408
01:01:43.341 --> 01:01:48.341
<v Speaker 3>the slower growing us and even slower </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing Japan and western Europe and </v>

1409
01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.560
<v Speaker 3>it's all the money is flowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's flowing in the wrong direction,</v>

1410
01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:57.070
<v Speaker 3>and that tells us something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we can debate what do you do about </v>

1411
01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:57.140
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1412
01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:00.380
<v Speaker 3>do you escalate in order to deescalate </v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

1413
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Do how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you rethink these things?</v>

1414
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.910
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1415
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:07.090
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all been opened up and I,</v>

1416
01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.440
<v Speaker 3>the prediction I would make is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever the Democratic nominee in 2020 </v>

1417
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.100
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will not,</v>

1418
01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:16.340
<v Speaker 3>they will not disagree with trump on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>trade issue.</v>

1419
01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.040
<v Speaker 3>They won't admit the trump changed their</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

1420
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>But this is one of the ways you win </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates is that,</v>

1421
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people come around to your side and they</v>

1422
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:26.000
<v Speaker 1>still say they never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1423
01:02:26.001 --> 01:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't because of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you really went.</v>

1424
01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that his really clever move </v>

1425
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>during the primary still where he kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1426
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.541
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how unfairly the DNC is treating </v>

1427
01:02:38.541 --> 01:02:41.121
<v Speaker 1>Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because basically he was hinting to all </v>

1428
01:02:41.121 --> 01:02:43.581
<v Speaker 1>of those people that were so frustrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the system when they screw him </v>

1429
01:02:43.581 --> 01:02:43.581
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

1430
01:02:43.581 --> 01:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm your guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1431
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a pretty,</v>

1432
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty clever little.</v>

1433
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Typically they're all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things like this,</v>

1434
01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is,</v>

1435
01:02:50.821 --> 01:02:54.750
<v Speaker 1>it is just these other debates were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

1436
01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1437
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question about NATO is,</v>

1438
01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:02.430
<v Speaker 1>is on the table now and once you put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the table,</v>

1439
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:03.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1440
01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:08.690
<v Speaker 1>why should the US be paying the lion's </v>
<v Speaker 1>share when we're actually mostly </v>

1441
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:09.330
<v Speaker 1>defending these other countries.</v>

1442
01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:12.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not like NATO is on the southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>border defending us from Mexico.</v>

1443
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1444
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:17.541
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to the way the mainstream </v>

1445
01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:17.541
<v Speaker 1>media focusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always,</v>

1446
01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:18.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump wants to blow up NATO,</v>

1447
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:24.020
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he wants other countries to pay </v>

1448
01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:24.810
<v Speaker 1>their fair share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are very,</v>

1449
01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:26.340
<v Speaker 1>very different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1450
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1451
01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.440
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're link because you might say,</v>

1452
01:03:28.441 --> 01:03:30.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>

1453
01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:31.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1454
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:36.350
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might be willing to pull out if you </v>

1455
01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:36.350
<v Speaker 1>don't pay your fair share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

1456
01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:37.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not like we're never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

1457
01:03:37.051 --> 01:03:37.620
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1458
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.820
<v Speaker 1>but certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1459
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.500
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1460
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:42.570
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1461
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.700
<v Speaker 1>nobody would disagree that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>should pay their fair share.</v>

1462
01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to even people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

1463
01:03:46.441 --> 01:03:51.441
<v Speaker 1>which is like prompt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the most egregious offender of </v>

1464
01:03:51.441 --> 01:03:52.020
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody disagrees with this behind closed</v>

1465
01:03:52.021 --> 01:03:52.410
<v Speaker 1>doors.</v>

1466
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:56.490
<v Speaker 1>So do you have any regrets?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any regrets about it.</v>

1467
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1468
01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:57.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1469
01:03:57.950 --> 01:04:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1470
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>it certainly was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a crazier two years and I </v>

1471
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:06.930
<v Speaker 1>would have thought and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I underestimated how,</v>

1472
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how intense some of the feelings people </v>

1473
01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:12.510
<v Speaker 1>have about politics are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no regrets.</v>

1474
01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make?</v>

1475
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Just the general tenor then right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we sort of are between a rock and a</v>

1476
01:04:17.491 --> 01:04:22.491
<v Speaker 1>hard place where it's like you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump and he's not going to change his </v>

1477
01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1478
01:04:22.861 --> 01:04:27.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've been very fair to him and </v>

1479
01:04:27.861 --> 01:04:29.541
<v Speaker 1>that's why I get a lot of criticism on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that front end and then you've got the </v>

1480
01:04:29.541 --> 01:04:29.610
<v Speaker 1>resistance or whatever you want to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1481
01:04:29.611 --> 01:04:34.611
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be doubling down on a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bad ideas that got them there in </v>

1482
01:04:34.611 --> 01:04:39.291
<v Speaker 1>the first place and that both sides now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just splitting and splitting and </v>

1483
01:04:39.291 --> 01:04:39.590
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're losing what I,</v>

1484
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:44.630
<v Speaker 1>where I think most people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is within some sort of basically </v>

1485
01:04:45.271 --> 01:04:48.570
<v Speaker 1>free society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarian live and let live thing.</v>

1486
01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I think I really believe that's where </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are,</v>

1487
01:04:50.341 --> 01:04:53.370
<v Speaker 1>but we seem to be being pulled in in </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite ways.</v>

1488
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that we framed a little </v>

1489
01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:58.460
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say we're,</v>

1490
01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.730
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1491
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:03.630
<v Speaker 1>we're moving past the Bush Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1492
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.840
<v Speaker 1>sort of do awfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1493
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>and which was not exactly libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1494
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:13.380
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty narrow zone.</v>

1495
01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.810
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't very much debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1496
01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:21.050
<v Speaker 1>all the smart people supposedly agreed </v>
<v Speaker 1>on everything and it didn't work all </v>

1497
01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:22.760
<v Speaker 1>that well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

1498
01:05:22.761 --> 01:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had sort of a,</v>

1499
01:05:23.981 --> 01:05:24.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1500
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>one fake bubble in our economy after </v>
<v Speaker 1>another and um,</v>

1501
01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1502
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:35.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of got us into a lot of things </v>

1503
01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:35.010
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were,</v>

1504
01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:35.010
<v Speaker 1>were not optimal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1505
01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:39.611
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think for the Bush Clinton maybe </v>

1506
01:05:39.611 --> 01:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>also Obama years was 24 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The debate I would say was,</v>

1507
01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1508
01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was too narrow.</v>

1509
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think within that sort of super </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow center to center left debate in </v>

1510
01:05:51.161 --> 01:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1511
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.240
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to find the solutions </v>

1512
01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.701
<v Speaker 1>to our problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be it's gonna be way outside </v>

1513
01:05:59.701 --> 01:05:59.701
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

1514
01:05:59.701 --> 01:06:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we will not go back.</v>

1515
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:06.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to go back to Hillary </v>

1516
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Clinton and 20 slash 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to go back to Jeb Bush.</v>

1517
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1518
01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:08.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1519
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be,</v>

1520
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.790
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a more wide open debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

1521
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>the parts of it that I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1522
01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1523
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:19.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the socialist question is going </v>

1524
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:21.940
<v Speaker 1>to be on the table in ways that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been for a long time and uh,</v>

1525
01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:27.040
<v Speaker 1>and I think I suspect the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Party is going to move much further to </v>

1526
01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.811
<v Speaker 1>the left and that's going to be a debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be having for the next </v>

1527
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.910
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>

1528
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I think they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's not gonna work,</v>

1529
01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:35.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1530
01:06:35.141 --> 01:06:36.460
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the Clinton,</v>

1531
01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:40.120
<v Speaker 1>the narrow Clinton stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going back to that.</v>

1532
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one more thing on trump for now.</v>

1533
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:45.460
<v Speaker 1>When you finally then came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak and said,</v>

1534
01:06:45.461 --> 01:06:47.440
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to support trump.</v>

1535
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Just personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like your cost,</v>

1536
01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:51.820
<v Speaker 1>you anything just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1537
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.350
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

1538
01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:58.351
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or did you even care if that was going </v>

1539
01:06:58.351 --> 01:06:58.690
<v Speaker 1>to be the case because a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people are going to go no matter what</v>

1540
01:06:58.691 --> 01:07:03.691
<v Speaker 1>you just said here about all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate issues related to trade and </v>

1541
01:07:03.691 --> 01:07:03.691
<v Speaker 1>government and all that they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1542
01:07:03.691 --> 01:07:06.070
<v Speaker 1>he's racist and Ltl is racist or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something along those lines.</v>

1543
01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1544
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I didn't cost me any friendships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1545
01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:10.450
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1546
01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the probably were,</v>

1547
01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:15.490
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some set of people that,</v>

1548
01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:16.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1549
01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:19.570
<v Speaker 1>where they were mad at me that had not </v>
<v Speaker 1>been mad at me before.</v>

1550
01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:20.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1551
01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:22.810
<v Speaker 1>that's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1552
01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1553
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:27.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1554
01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it was that </v>

1555
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1556
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.740
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of like,</v>

1557
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:34.750
<v Speaker 1>like in one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one way,</v>

1558
01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:36.820
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the least contrary of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things I've ever done.</v>

1559
01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:39.280
<v Speaker 1>It was like half the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that contrarian.</v>

1560
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you say that the valley,</v>

1561
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.900
<v Speaker 1>it felt really contrarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1562
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:44.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1563
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.340
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of why you,</v>

1564
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:51.370
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing something that half the </v>

1565
01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:53.140
<v Speaker 1>country agrees with you on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of weird for that to be beyond</v>

1566
01:07:53.141 --> 01:07:53.950
<v Speaker 1>the Pale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1567
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:55.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually hilarious,</v>

1568
01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:01.240
<v Speaker 1>least contrary and move in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The least contouring thing I've done.</v>

1569
01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1570
01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:03.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1571
01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:04.110
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1572
01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

1573
01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1574
01:08:08.021 --> 01:08:08.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1575
01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 1>but there is something about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics that's intense.</v>

1576
01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>It felt zero sum for a long time.</v>

1577
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1578
01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:19.430
<v Speaker 3>it is polarized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's extreme.</v>

1579
01:08:19.431 --> 01:08:22.010
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what the answers are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there are,</v>

1580
01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.700
<v Speaker 3>there are ways that it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1581
01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:26.780
<v Speaker 3>it's been weaponized that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are not always,</v>

1582
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:28.420
<v Speaker 3>not always healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1583
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:29.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1584
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're going to go back to </v>

1585
01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:34.600
<v Speaker 3>the status quo ante unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately or unfortunately,</v>

1586
01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 3>that's just sort of gone with the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not we're not going back,</v>

1587
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:37.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

1588
01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:41.070
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite possible we're gonna,</v>

1589
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have sort of ever more intense politics </v>

1590
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.961
<v Speaker 3>for quite some time in one of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>colleagues coined this term about a </v>

1591
01:08:49.961 --> 01:08:50.070
<v Speaker 3>decade ago that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1592
01:08:50.530 --> 01:08:52.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something was John,</v>

1593
01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Jim Cramer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crazy person on CNBC.</v>

1594
01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:57.920
<v Speaker 3>He has this line where there's always a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bull market somewhere.</v>

1595
01:08:57.921 --> 01:08:59.900
<v Speaker 3>You have to just look for gift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know where to find it.</v>

1596
01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:02.730
<v Speaker 3>And then the bull market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1597
01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.290
<v Speaker 3>my colleague suggested this was around </v>
<v Speaker 3>2008 that was getting started,</v>

1598
01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.610
<v Speaker 3>was a bull market in politics and which </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not a,</v>

1599
01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:13.010
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily a place where you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>there to be a bull market,</v>

1600
01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:14.000
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1601
01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:19.060
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we are in this sort of bull </v>

1602
01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 3>market in politics and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

1603
01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:24.500
<v Speaker 3>it still has no end in sight and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be looking for,</v>

1604
01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>options that are further outside the </v>

1605
01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:29.800
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

1606
01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.710
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the debate may be,</v>

1607
01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:33.830
<v Speaker 3>it may be even more intense the in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ahead than it has been.</v>

1608
01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:34.610
<v Speaker 3>It's been before.</v>

1609
01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's enough about trump for </v>

1610
01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.730
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling he'll probably appear </v>

1611
01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:41.730
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's talk about sensemaking because</v>

1612
01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:46.331
<v Speaker 2>Eric Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I guess is the architect of the </v>

1613
01:09:46.331 --> 01:09:48.200
<v Speaker 2>intellectual dark web,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the,</v>

1614
01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:53.350
<v Speaker 2>what is his title?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the managing director of deal </v>

1615
01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:53.350
<v Speaker 2>capitals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man of many hats.</v>

1616
01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:54.620
<v Speaker 2>A man of many hats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1617
01:09:54.621 --> 01:09:58.400
<v Speaker 2>So one of the ideas that he has </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed many times in this very studio</v>

1618
01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:03.820
<v Speaker 2>is that what's happening right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that our sensemaking or communal sense </v>

1619
01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:07.831
<v Speaker 2>making in America is just failing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our ability to trust the media or </v>

1620
01:10:07.831 --> 01:10:12.461
<v Speaker 2>CNN or New York Times or the rest of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has failed to the point that this </v>

1621
01:10:12.461 --> 01:10:13.700
<v Speaker 2>intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark web,</v>

1622
01:10:13.701 --> 01:10:16.940
<v Speaker 2>this crew of about 20 or so people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1623
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:22.630
<v Speaker 2>are the last bastion of our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just make sense of things or at least </v>

1624
01:10:22.671 --> 01:10:23.810
<v Speaker 2>try to make sense of things.</v>

1625
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:27.890
<v Speaker 2>So I have a couple of questions on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but first Eric works for you.</v>

1626
01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:30.800
<v Speaker 2>You guys have major disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a Bernie guy.</v>

1627
01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:35.801
<v Speaker 2>You obviously supported trump a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's been on these shows and </v>

1628
01:10:35.801 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 2>talked about probably policies that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't agree with and things like that.</v>

1629
01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Yet you let this guy do whatever he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants.</v>

1630
01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great credit to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why?</v>

1631
01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Why do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1632
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:50.770
<v Speaker 2>why do you let this guy run around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever he wants to do even when </v>

1633
01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:51.980
<v Speaker 2>it's in conflict with what you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think most people would do that.</v>

1634
01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1635
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in ideas always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that,</v>

1636
01:10:57.241 --> 01:11:00.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think all the ideas are,</v>

1637
01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:03.660
<v Speaker 3>are just the conventional ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there are.</v>

1638
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that I think we need to find new</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>

1639
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.630
<v Speaker 3>new ways of approaching the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it.</v>

1640
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:15.110
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Eric is certainly absolutely first </v>

1641
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:17.130
<v Speaker 3>grade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heterodox thinker and uh,</v>

1642
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.110
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

1643
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:24.550
<v Speaker 3>and I think all of our politics are </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat eclectic and somewhat complex </v>

1644
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.980
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1645
01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric is more on the left.</v>

1646
01:11:26.191 --> 01:11:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm more on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1647
01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:28.560
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1648
01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:33.740
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we both interested in ideas were </v>

1649
01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:34.620
<v Speaker 3>interesting to figuring out how to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of our world and uh,</v>

1650
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.160
<v Speaker 3>and that unites us and it's always </v>
<v Speaker 3>surprising how that's a pretty unusual </v>

1651
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.020
<v Speaker 3>place to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's much of,</v>

1652
01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:44.400
<v Speaker 3>it's not about ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1653
01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:47.580
<v Speaker 3>as we said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about power or fashion or something</v>

1654
01:11:47.581 --> 01:11:48.000
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1655
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:53.180
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most guys in your position wouldn't </v>

1656
01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.810
<v Speaker 2>be allowing one of their top people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be out there often taking positions that</v>

1657
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:59.811
<v Speaker 2>are against them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's something about you that's </v>

1658
01:11:59.811 --> 01:11:59.811
<v Speaker 2>allowing you to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1659
01:11:59.811 --> 01:11:59.811
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1660
01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't want to,</v>

1661
01:12:01.711 --> 01:12:03.390
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't want to sit here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pat yourself on the back,</v>

1662
01:12:03.391 --> 01:12:06.540
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's an important piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something I think,</v>

1663
01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:08.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not sure I'm right about this,</v>

1664
01:12:08.431 --> 01:12:08.920
<v Speaker 3>but let me go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

1665
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:10.590
<v Speaker 3>let me be a little bit more modest than </v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

1666
01:12:10.591 --> 01:12:15.591
<v Speaker 3>but I think most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of my peers in silicon valley,</v>

1667
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that the ideas are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are more set.</v>

1668
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.160
<v Speaker 3>We sort of know all the right answers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's inefficient.</v>

1669
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:27.000
<v Speaker 3>It's a waste of time to be exploring </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of that.</v>

1670
01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:28.580
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the,</v>

1671
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:30.570
<v Speaker 3>the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the substantive question you have to ask</v>

1672
01:12:30.571 --> 01:12:32.880
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the ideas right?</v>

1673
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.760
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should we have more exploration?</v>

1674
01:12:35.761 --> 01:12:36.520
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1675
01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.610
<v Speaker 3>you take the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take the climate change debate,</v>

1676
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.950
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a view that,</v>

1677
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:41.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know it's happening.</v>

1678
01:12:41.481 --> 01:12:42.630
<v Speaker 3>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go to the agenda.</v>

1679
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.940
<v Speaker 3>We know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1680
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:47.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a runaway problem and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1681
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:49.230
<v Speaker 3>and if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't,</v>

1682
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:52.970
<v Speaker 3>we can't even pause and think about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we know all these things.</v>

1683
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:55.860
<v Speaker 3>We have to just focus all our energy on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on solving them.</v>

1684
01:12:56.310 --> 01:13:00.210
<v Speaker 3>And so if those things are true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that might be reasonable.</v>

1685
01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.910
<v Speaker 3>If they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're not entirely true,</v>

1686
01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.120
<v Speaker 3>like maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe maybe climate change is maybe it's</v>

1687
01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:11.121
<v Speaker 3>more methane and carbon dioxide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which case maybe eating steak is </v>

1688
01:13:11.121 --> 01:13:15.261
<v Speaker 3>worse than driving a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe maybe climate change is a </v>

1689
01:13:15.261 --> 01:13:18.321
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little different from the way we </v>

1690
01:13:18.321 --> 01:13:18.321
<v Speaker 3>think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if these things are not true,</v>

1691
01:13:18.321 --> 01:13:18.810
<v Speaker 3>then we need to have much more of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate.</v>

1692
01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:24.260
<v Speaker 3>And so the kind of question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's very hard that you have to </v>

1693
01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:27.350
<v Speaker 3>make some judgment on us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we more or less have the truth about </v>

1694
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.790
<v Speaker 3>everything or don't we?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1695
01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.430
<v Speaker 3>and my views that were really far off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think a lot of my peers think,</v>

1696
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:35.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were kind of at the end of history,</v>

1697
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.290
<v Speaker 3>we sort of figured everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1698
01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:40.890
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to belong ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to be an interesting,</v>

1699
01:13:40.891 --> 01:13:43.800
<v Speaker 3>weird ideas are just wrong and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a waste of time.</v>

1700
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:45.810
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of their bias.</v>

1701
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Mine's the opposite.</v>

1702
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that this set of people,</v>

1703
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.030
<v Speaker 2>and I think I would include you in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a broader sense.</v>

1704
01:13:54.031 --> 01:13:55.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're sitting here and doing this,</v>

1705
01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:01.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think we have a chance of </v>

1706
01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:01.220
<v Speaker 2>resetting some of this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1707
01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look in the last week,</v>

1708
01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alon going on Rogan,</v>

1709
01:14:03.151 --> 01:14:06.780
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting down here again without </v>
<v Speaker 2>patting myself on the back from them.</v>

1710
01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Like I view that as like a landscape </v>
<v Speaker 2>change of the way people</v>

1711
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:16.150
<v Speaker 1>that are influencers are visionaries are</v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting to media.</v>

1712
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.870
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1713
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:18.760
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1714
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.410
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the boxes are too narrow,</v>

1715
01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1716
01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the baby boomer since 1968,</v>

1717
01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>they'd been re litigating 1968 for 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1718
01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.830
<v Speaker 1>We've had like the same fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting kind of old,</v>

1719
01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's been been groundhog day for 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1720
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:36.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1721
01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:37.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1722
01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:43.060
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there's something past </v>

1723
01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:43.810
<v Speaker 1>groundhog day and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the bias you have bias I have.</v>

1724
01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:49.170
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think part of it is I'm not just </v>

1725
01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:51.460
<v Speaker 1>talking about talking about ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bringing forth some specific ideas.</v>

1726
01:14:51.461 --> 01:14:53.860
<v Speaker 1>These are things that are different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are changing,</v>

1727
01:14:53.861 --> 01:14:55.000
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1728
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:58.900
<v Speaker 1>that the world may look very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future from where it looks in the</v>

1729
01:14:58.901 --> 01:15:03.901
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think we're not at the end of </v>

1730
01:15:03.901 --> 01:15:05.791
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not at a time where ideas don't </v>

1731
01:15:05.791 --> 01:15:05.791
<v Speaker 1>matter or people can't do things.</v>

1732
01:15:05.791 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I think the future will be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from the present.</v>

1733
01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's going to be better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's going to be worse.</v>

1734
01:15:09.521 --> 01:15:11.140
<v Speaker 1>It's up to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1735
01:15:11.141 --> 01:15:12.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm,</v>

1736
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm super long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1737
01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.930
<v Speaker 1>having a very broad conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1738
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that you brought up the baby </v>

1739
01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.791
<v Speaker 1>boomers from omen because it does seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that partly what's happening here </v>

1740
01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.240
<v Speaker 1>is that they're at their last grasps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling things.</v>

1741
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.390
<v Speaker 1>And in an odd way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gen x,</v>

1742
01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:33.391
<v Speaker 1>my generation got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think you're probably right </v>

1743
01:15:33.391 --> 01:15:34.210
<v Speaker 1>around a little bit ahead of me on Gen </v>
<v Speaker 1>x,</v>

1744
01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.240
<v Speaker 1>that we sort of got lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>

1745
01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:39.790
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like we handed everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>off to the millennials,</v>

1746
01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:42.340
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't give them any of the tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able.</v>

1747
01:15:42.341 --> 01:15:44.380
<v Speaker 1>They were too young and didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools or the,</v>

1748
01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.500
<v Speaker 1>or the financial instruments to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make any change.</v>

1749
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that mean there are a lot of </v>

1750
01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:52.990
<v Speaker 1>strange generational dynamics one could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one could talk about.</v>

1751
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I had been very struck in recent months </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thinking about this,</v>

1752
01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>how there is something very odd in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what happened to gen x,</v>

1753
01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.780
<v Speaker 1>which is people born say 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>65 to 1980 was the birth years.</v>

1754
01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Boomers were sort of 46 to 64 and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somehow,</v>

1755
01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:13.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boomers dominated things like crazy.</v>

1756
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.790
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was,</v>

1757
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:21.070
<v Speaker 1>we were sort of like in the shadow of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people and all sorts of different,</v>

1758
01:16:21.071 --> 01:16:23.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all sorts of different contexts.</v>

1759
01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.470
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was gen x was probably the first time</v>

1760
01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:30.250
<v Speaker 1>that you had a generation that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller in numbers and the one that came</v>

1761
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:31.960
<v Speaker 1>before us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1762
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:37.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of coincided with an era of </v>

1763
01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:39.220
<v Speaker 1>slower growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slower progress.</v>

1764
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:44.310
<v Speaker 1>So there was sort of fewer opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rise of baby boomers held onto their </v>

1765
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.560
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>

1766
01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:45.970
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1767
01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:51.050
<v Speaker 1>like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started working in a law firm in </v>

1768
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan in the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean always,</v>

1769
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't thinking of it consciously this</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1770
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:55.561
<v Speaker 1>but it was the baby boomer partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just become partner and they were </v>

1771
01:16:55.561 --> 01:16:59.671
<v Speaker 1>sort of pulling the ladder up behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and it was going to be much harder </v>

1772
01:16:59.671 --> 01:16:59.671
<v Speaker 1>for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My generation,</v>

1773
01:16:59.671 --> 01:17:04.330
<v Speaker 1>our generation to do the same things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go down the track and the same in the</v>

1774
01:17:04.331 --> 01:17:06.400
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there is something,</v>

1775
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>there is something very weird about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how gen x</v>

1776
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.450
<v Speaker 3>has gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1777
01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:17.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been sort of sidelined by the </v>

1778
01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:17.100
<v Speaker 3>boomers for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the,</v>

1779
01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrap on us is always that we're,</v>

1780
01:17:19.810 --> 01:17:21.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're too,</v>

1781
01:17:21.021 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too young or too old.</v>

1782
01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we were in the nineties when gen </v>

1783
01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.840
<v Speaker 3>x was starting to tech companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were seen as too young.</v>

1784
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.690
<v Speaker 3>We needed adult supervision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We needed the baby boomers to,</v>

1785
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.720
<v Speaker 3>to run the companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an almost every gen x of founder </v>

1786
01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 3>and some exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but overwhelmingly the boomers took over</v>

1787
01:17:40.641 --> 01:17:45.641
<v Speaker 3>the company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a version this with Yahoo and </v>

1788
01:17:45.641 --> 01:17:45.641
<v Speaker 3>Ebay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>netscape,</v>

1789
01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:50.860
<v Speaker 3>even Google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the biggest of the gen x </v>

1790
01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:50.860
<v Speaker 3>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1791
01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:55.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a 10 year period where Eric </v>

1792
01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the baby boomer took over,</v>

1793
01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.690
<v Speaker 3>took over Google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the boomer companies,</v>

1794
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.330
<v Speaker 3>apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft,</v>

1795
01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft and Amazon.</v>

1796
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.800
<v Speaker 3>Amazon was just saying people got to run</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole time.</v>

1797
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:12.430
<v Speaker 3>And then apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more chaotic facebook </v>

1798
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.430
<v Speaker 3>millennial company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got to run it.</v>

1799
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:17.680
<v Speaker 3>Gen x not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that tech is like </v>

1800
01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.601
<v Speaker 3>meritocratic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not supposed to be about culture </v>

1801
01:18:22.601 --> 01:18:24.080
<v Speaker 3>and voting and stuff like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I think,</v>

1802
01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:25.880
<v Speaker 3>I think on a Po,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a political level,</v>

1803
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:28.280
<v Speaker 3>it's striking how underrepresented we </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1804
01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:34.560
<v Speaker 3>A 20 slash 20 should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be a prime year for a gen x </v>

1805
01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:38.240
<v Speaker 3>presidential candidate on the democratic</v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

1806
01:18:38.241 --> 01:18:43.241
<v Speaker 3>someone born between 1965 and 1980.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I challenge you to name me a single </v>

1807
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:47.720
<v Speaker 3>plausible genex Democrat,</v>

1808
01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.870
<v Speaker 2>like a loser like Cory Booker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1809
01:18:50.871 --> 01:18:53.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think there's several reasons for</v>

1810
01:18:53.271 --> 01:18:55.640
<v Speaker 2>that on the democratic side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but God depend on that.</v>

1811
01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Somehow</v>

1812
01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.730
<v Speaker 3>the boomers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there more of them and so they,</v>

1813
01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:02.100
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look like it's truth in numbers and</v>

1814
01:19:02.101 --> 01:19:07.101
<v Speaker 3>it's the baby boomer bubble in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always been that the numbers make </v>

1815
01:19:07.101 --> 01:19:11.601
<v Speaker 3>it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you have a lot of people it's </v>

1816
01:19:11.601 --> 01:19:13.791
<v Speaker 3>true and that's kind of what worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it in the boomers were this </v>

1817
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:16.320
<v Speaker 3>unusually big generation and it was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>about them.</v>

1818
01:19:16.321 --> 01:19:20.130
<v Speaker 3>It just about getting consensus and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could overwhelm things and that's,</v>

1819
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.280
<v Speaker 3>that's what you had to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's,</v>

1820
01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.830
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of coming to an end and </v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly I wonder,</v>

1821
01:19:25.831 --> 01:19:29.910
<v Speaker 2>do you think there's also just the flat </v>
<v Speaker 2>out technological component to this that</v>

1822
01:19:29.911 --> 01:19:34.911
<v Speaker 2>we ingenex we're the last generation </v>
<v Speaker 2>that grew up without all of this tech,</v>

1823
01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.950
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know what the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection is,</v>

1824
01:19:37.951 --> 01:19:42.951
<v Speaker 2>but I remember being in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my freshman year I remember some</v>

1825
01:19:43.381 --> 01:19:48.381
<v Speaker 2>kid down the hallway screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the Internet and I went into his </v>

1826
01:19:48.381 --> 01:19:48.750
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've told this story a couple times.</v>

1827
01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I went into his room and it said </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yankees,</v>

1828
01:19:50.641 --> 01:19:55.641
<v Speaker 2>three royals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one and it had two pictures at a little </v>

1829
01:19:55.641 --> 01:19:58.101
<v Speaker 2>bit and I swear on my life I remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking this is the stupidest thing </v>

1830
01:19:58.101 --> 01:20:01.881
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we did not grow up with the phones </v>

1831
01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:02.070
<v Speaker 2>in our pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't grow up connected all of those</v>

1832
01:20:02.071 --> 01:20:07.071
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it almost seems to me there's some </v>

1833
01:20:07.071 --> 01:20:07.071
<v Speaker 2>connection to that where then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>millennials came in,</v>

1834
01:20:07.071 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 2>they so connected</v>

1835
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.870
<v Speaker 3>to all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the media,</v>

1836
01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:14.871
<v Speaker 3>because the media wants clicks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything paid so much attention to </v>

1837
01:20:14.871 --> 01:20:16.260
<v Speaker 3>them that that may be pushed out gen x a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit more.</v>

1838
01:20:16.261 --> 01:20:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

1839
01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:22.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm just doing this cultural history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always many variables.</v>

1840
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Super overdetermined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1841
01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I do think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1842
01:20:27.601 --> 01:20:32.601
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about the millennial </v>

1843
01:20:32.601 --> 01:20:35.541
<v Speaker 3>vibe that feels more conformist and gen </v>
<v Speaker 3>x feels less conformist.</v>

1844
01:20:37.021 --> 01:20:38.130
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1845
01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:40.210
<v Speaker 3>and so one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1846
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.140
<v Speaker 3>good and bad things about being overly </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected,</v>

1847
01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.130
<v Speaker 3>overly technologically connected is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1848
01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:48.930
<v Speaker 3>you get to get to know the score right </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1849
01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:50.790
<v Speaker 3>You get the answer right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1850
01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:53.610
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to be scared of climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>change right away.</v>

1851
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's good.</v>

1852
01:20:55.591 --> 01:20:58.770
<v Speaker 3>If it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad if it's a shortcut.</v>

1853
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:04.220
<v Speaker 3>And so our generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say it was the last one that </v>

1854
01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:04.220
<v Speaker 3>didn't take shortcuts.</v>

1855
01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.480
<v Speaker 3>And most of the time the boomers learned</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take shortcuts.</v>

1856
01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:11.540
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't take as many shortcuts like </v>

1857
01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.941
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Millennials have no to take all the </v>

1858
01:21:13.941 --> 01:21:16.131
<v Speaker 3>shortcuts and it's a good idea to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>shortcuts in a world where nobody takes </v>

1859
01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:21.861
<v Speaker 3>shortcuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a world where everybody takes </v>

1860
01:21:21.861 --> 01:21:22.460
<v Speaker 3>shortcuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1861
01:21:22.810 --> 01:21:27.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to actually figure out and </v>

1862
01:21:27.810 --> 01:21:29.360
<v Speaker 3>maybe the shortcut isn't going to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're actually better off figuring </v>

1863
01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:29.360
<v Speaker 3>out the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1864
01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.660
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one way to frame this,</v>

1865
01:21:30.661 --> 01:21:35.661
<v Speaker 3>to be in the boomer era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boomers who figured out how to take </v>

1866
01:21:36.421 --> 01:21:39.180
<v Speaker 3>shortcuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shortcut and politics is,</v>

1867
01:21:39.181 --> 01:21:41.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to figure out what I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the issues I'm going to school.</v>

1868
01:21:41.671 --> 01:21:46.671
<v Speaker 3>Look at the polls and the pollsters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one who's really running for </v>

1869
01:21:46.671 --> 01:21:49.770
<v Speaker 3>president and just listening to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pollster and that was,</v>

1870
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:53.970
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't effective boomer technique </v>
<v Speaker 3>for many years that you just look at the</v>

1871
01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:56.580
<v Speaker 3>polls and if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had a better pollster,</v>

1872
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:59.520
<v Speaker 3>you could more quickly get to where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>puck was going,</v>

1873
01:21:59.521 --> 01:22:02.610
<v Speaker 3>where the crowd was going and you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to think.</v>

1874
01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.500
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have to waste time thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about stuff.</v>

1875
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:07.350
<v Speaker 3>And so in a world where very few people </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing it,</v>

1876
01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:12.860
<v Speaker 3>that can be a very good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time you get to something like </v>

1877
01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:14.640
<v Speaker 3>the millennials where everyone's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained to do shortcuts,</v>

1878
01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:20.840
<v Speaker 3>that somehow doesn't quite work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It vaguely maps onto the tracking </v>

1879
01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:25.340
<v Speaker 3>because you can think of tracking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>school tracking professionally is a way </v>

1880
01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:29.181
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a shortcut to a successful </v>

1881
01:22:29.181 --> 01:22:31.230
<v Speaker 3>career and so the baby boomers who </v>
<v Speaker 3>stayed on track did quite well,</v>

1882
01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:36.290
<v Speaker 3>so if you didn't tune in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop out and the late sixties and it </v>

1883
01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:39.730
<v Speaker 3>just went to law school and you became a</v>
<v Speaker 3>partner at a law firm that it kind of </v>

1884
01:22:39.730 --> 01:22:41.250
<v Speaker 3>tracks worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time we get to the millennials,</v>

1885
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:43.620
<v Speaker 3>they know all the tracks you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

1886
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:45.740
<v Speaker 3>Tracks work less well when everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows everyone.</v>

1887
01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's doing the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it has sort of.</v>

1888
01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:51.450
<v Speaker 3>There are these similarities between the</v>
<v Speaker 3>millennials and the boomers,</v>

1889
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:54.420
<v Speaker 3>but the lesson that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1890
01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:56.820
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really different in practice and</v>

1891
01:22:56.830 --> 01:23:01.830
<v Speaker 3>it's working really differently so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that would have worked </v>

1892
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:03.000
<v Speaker 3>perfectly for you as a boomer are deadly</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a millennial.</v>

1893
01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1894
01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so hearing that and</v>

1895
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.250
<v Speaker 2>knowing that our sensemaking is breaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and our ability,</v>

1896
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.620
<v Speaker 2>even our ability to just get away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this,</v>

1897
01:23:11.621 --> 01:23:15.370
<v Speaker 2>what you said before about paying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much attention to politics and all that.</v>

1898
01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Everyone asks the whole idw crew </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly,</v>

1899
01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:21.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you guys going to do?</v>

1900
01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:22.560
<v Speaker 2>And you just said something about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1901
01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:23.860
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't just talk about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1902
01:23:23.861 --> 01:23:28.570
<v Speaker 2>We got to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see either a technological answer</v>

1903
01:23:28.571 --> 01:23:32.920
<v Speaker 2>here or a business answer here or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1904
01:23:32.921 --> 01:23:37.921
<v Speaker 2>And we've talked about this a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>privately before and it's been kind of </v>

1905
01:23:37.921 --> 01:23:40.771
<v Speaker 2>bounced it around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like everyone wants some answers to </v>

1906
01:23:40.771 --> 01:23:43.210
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here with the media and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything else.</v>

1907
01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:44.680
<v Speaker 2>And the pipes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1908
01:23:44.681 --> 01:23:47.230
<v Speaker 2>that Google owns all the pipes and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that stuff.</v>

1909
01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:50.080
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of people is a default</v>
<v Speaker 2>position is well too.</v>

1910
01:23:50.081 --> 01:23:55.081
<v Speaker 2>We'll fix it because it's like there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>only a couple people that actually </v>

1911
01:23:55.081 --> 01:23:55.081
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

1912
01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1913
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:57.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1914
01:23:57.441 --> 01:24:00.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't actually quite know what one </v>
<v Speaker 3>does to,</v>

1915
01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.510
<v Speaker 3>to fix the media industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1916
01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:06.170
<v Speaker 3>I would say the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1917
01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:11.480
<v Speaker 3>the thing that I'm always super fixated </v>
<v Speaker 3>on is the business model questions zero </v>

1918
01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:13.120
<v Speaker 3>to one book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1919
01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.470
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main motif has always,</v>

1920
01:24:15.471 --> 01:24:17.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you shouldn't compete.</v>

1921
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:22.390
<v Speaker 3>You should try to have a monopolies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to do something that you do so </v>

1922
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:23.270
<v Speaker 3>well that you have no competition and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1923
01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:28.370
<v Speaker 3>the good and bad things about monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But from the inside you generally want </v>

1924
01:24:28.371 --> 01:24:33.371
<v Speaker 3>to have a monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets a little bit bad if you become </v>

1925
01:24:33.371 --> 01:24:33.450
<v Speaker 3>too fat and lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1926
01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:36.530
<v Speaker 3>and if you didn't ever have competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really in trouble.</v>

1927
01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:42.100
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way the business history I would </v>

1928
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:42.100
<v Speaker 3>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1929
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:46.810
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream media is that they used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have great monopolies.</v>

1930
01:24:48.090 --> 01:24:53.090
<v Speaker 3>The newspapers had local content </v>
<v Speaker 3>monopolies and the local monopolies and </v>

1931
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:57.971
<v Speaker 3>advertisers because the only way you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could advertise was through the </v>

1932
01:24:57.971 --> 01:25:00.750
<v Speaker 3>classified section of newspaper or news </v>
<v Speaker 3>magazines or you know,</v>

1933
01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:04.430
<v Speaker 3>they're all these sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these sorts of media monopolies.</v>

1934
01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:09.490
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what technology with the Internet has </v>

1935
01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:13.091
<v Speaker 3>done is it's opened things up in ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are good for information,</v>

1936
01:25:14.721 --> 01:25:16.100
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for learning things,</v>

1937
01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's very bad for their business </v>
<v Speaker 3>models.</v>

1938
01:25:19.050 --> 01:25:23.150
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is something they never</v>
<v Speaker 3>really understood.</v>

1939
01:25:23.610 --> 01:25:28.610
<v Speaker 3>And so if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were at the Washington Post in </v>

1940
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:31.901
<v Speaker 3>the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you sort of imagine what the holiday </v>

1941
01:25:31.901 --> 01:25:32.060
<v Speaker 3>party would have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1942
01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:32.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1943
01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.270
<v Speaker 3>the owner of the post would have said </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

1944
01:25:35.271 --> 01:25:36.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1945
01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:38.390
<v Speaker 3>we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all getting paid,</v>

1946
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing great.</v>

1947
01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Business is doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have all these talented people that </v>

1948
01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:45.830
<v Speaker 3>are writing great stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the narrative would be that it was a</v>

1949
01:25:45.831 --> 01:25:48.920
<v Speaker 3>great business because of the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

1950
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:52.850
<v Speaker 3>the people there were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the true story was something like,</v>

1951
01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:58.160
<v Speaker 3>I know you're working for utility </v>
<v Speaker 3>company and doesn't matter what you do </v>

1952
01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:01.751
<v Speaker 3>because we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna make these monopoly profits </v>

1953
01:26:01.751 --> 01:26:01.751
<v Speaker 3>year after year after year.</v>

1954
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:07.030
<v Speaker 3>And then when the monopoly story started</v>
<v Speaker 3>to break the story was not the </v>

1955
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:10.490
<v Speaker 3>monopolies going away because they can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about that.</v>

1956
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the story was rather,</v>

1957
01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:14.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

1958
01:26:14.121 --> 01:26:19.121
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know anything about the </v>

1959
01:26:19.121 --> 01:26:19.121
<v Speaker 3>internet or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think,</v>

1960
01:26:19.121 --> 01:26:21.770
<v Speaker 3>I think the challenge that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>media,</v>

1961
01:26:21.771 --> 01:26:25.610
<v Speaker 3>old media businesses have haven't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>been described correctly.</v>

1962
01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:29.330
<v Speaker 3>And then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it is,</v>

1963
01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:30.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of,</v>

1964
01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.980
<v Speaker 3>it sort of plays out in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1965
01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1966
01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:34.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1967
01:26:34.930 --> 01:26:37.130
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have to figure out some new ways</v>

1968
01:26:37.131 --> 01:26:40.880
<v Speaker 3>to get distribution channels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new ways to monetize and you know,</v>

1969
01:26:40.881 --> 01:26:45.881
<v Speaker 3>the are there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there will be models for doing </v>

1970
01:26:45.881 --> 01:26:45.881
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the,</v>

1971
01:26:45.881 --> 01:26:45.881
<v Speaker 3>that's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to do it.</v>

1972
01:26:45.881 --> 01:26:47.000
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1973
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:49.460
<v Speaker 3>you can't go back to the old monopolies </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1974
01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1975
01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:51.390
<v Speaker 2>we need some answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1976
01:26:51.391 --> 01:26:56.391
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's shift a little bit to some of </v>

1977
01:26:56.391 --> 01:26:58.111
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of your history because I think a </v>

1978
01:26:58.111 --> 01:27:00.111
<v Speaker 2>lot of people are a certain set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people probably only know you through </v>

1979
01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:03.780
<v Speaker 2>the gawker prism and every time I read </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about Gawker or what happened </v>

1980
01:27:05.341 --> 01:27:10.341
<v Speaker 2>with you or hulk Hogan it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it always seemed so distorted the way </v>

1981
01:27:10.341 --> 01:27:10.980
<v Speaker 2>they presented it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is probably very obvious to you.</v>

1982
01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.850
<v Speaker 2>But to me it was like you weren't people</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people will say,</v>

1983
01:27:14.851 --> 01:27:18.150
<v Speaker 2>well teal hates the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sued a publication.</v>

1984
01:27:18.151 --> 01:27:21.240
<v Speaker 2>He obviously hates the media and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1985
01:27:21.330 --> 01:27:24.210
<v Speaker 2>actually you were defending the right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>privacy,</v>

1986
01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:27.780
<v Speaker 2>which is something that the media should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be doing in and of itself.</v>

1987
01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what made you want to get involved in </v>

1988
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.871
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had your own history with Gawker </v>

1989
01:27:35.871 --> 01:27:35.871
<v Speaker 2>obviously before.</v>

1990
01:27:35.871 --> 01:27:35.871
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all that it is,</v>

1991
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:41.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are all these elements of the </v>

1992
01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:41.050
<v Speaker 3>story that are of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1993
01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:43.230
<v Speaker 3>sort of look a little bit larger than </v>
<v Speaker 3>life where you have sort of the </v>

1994
01:27:43.230 --> 01:27:43.540
<v Speaker 3>sociopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1995
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Manhattan media company and I think </v>

1996
01:27:49.871 --> 01:27:52.830
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

1997
01:27:52.831 --> 01:27:57.831
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our internal code name for Gawker was </v>

1998
01:27:57.831 --> 01:28:00.961
<v Speaker 3>the Mbta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Manhattan based terrorist </v>

1999
01:28:00.961 --> 01:28:00.961
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2000
01:28:00.961 --> 01:28:01.630
<v Speaker 3>you've likened them to al Qaeda before </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

2001
01:28:01.631 --> 01:28:03.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

2002
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:04.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2003
01:28:04.211 --> 01:28:09.211
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was some crazy story in [inaudible] </v>

2004
01:28:09.211 --> 01:28:09.211
<v Speaker 3>where they just completely distorted </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2005
01:28:09.211 --> 01:28:12.660
<v Speaker 3>And I was speaking to a reporter at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>San Jose Mercury News and like,</v>

2006
01:28:12.670 --> 01:28:13.630
<v Speaker 3>what do you think of them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2007
01:28:13.631 --> 01:28:18.631
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll kind of silicon valley and say </v>

2008
01:28:18.631 --> 01:28:19.400
<v Speaker 3>that yes you can because of course you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get on.</v>

2009
01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:20.320
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2010
01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:21.320
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2011
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:23.120
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2012
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:25.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think they,</v>

2013
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:27.120
<v Speaker 3>they were sort of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2014
01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:32.890
<v Speaker 3>and it was in some ways you're all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of things you can say about it were kind</v>

2015
01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:35.530
<v Speaker 3>of crazy and it was super destructive.</v>

2016
01:28:35.530 --> 01:28:38.020
<v Speaker 3>They went mostly they didn't go after </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like myself.</v>

2017
01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:41.230
<v Speaker 3>They went after people who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively powerless,</v>

2018
01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:46.660
<v Speaker 3>often just average people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not public figures in any sense of the </v>

2019
01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:47.210
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2020
01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hogan was sort of an in between person </v>

2021
01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:52.440
<v Speaker 3>had been like a very high profile </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrity,</v>

2022
01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:52.650
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2023
01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.770
<v Speaker 3>was definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was definitely beating up on a weaker</v>

2024
01:28:56.771 --> 01:28:58.000
<v Speaker 3>person in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

2025
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.480
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2026
01:28:58.490 --> 01:29:01.030
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the context in which they did it.</v>

2027
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:06.140
<v Speaker 3>So it had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had this sort of heroic underdog </v>

2028
01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:06.550
<v Speaker 3>fighting this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2029
01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:10.410
<v Speaker 3>this sort of hate factory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He factory machine.</v>

2030
01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:12.130
<v Speaker 3>I bought her the right way to describe </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2031
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.200
<v Speaker 3>targeted at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2032
01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.780
<v Speaker 3>at various,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at various people.</v>

2033
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:17.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2034
01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2035
01:29:18.570 --> 01:29:22.290
<v Speaker 3>we have a first amendment and I believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2036
01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:24.250
<v Speaker 3>I believe in freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2037
01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course always,</v>

2038
01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:26.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2039
01:29:26.490 --> 01:29:28.590
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Hogan trial,</v>

2040
01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:30.270
<v Speaker 3>although the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2041
01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:34.350
<v Speaker 3>the jury trial and the jury trial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can always argue the law.</v>

2042
01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.330
<v Speaker 3>We can argue the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

2043
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:37.020
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2044
01:29:37.021 --> 01:29:39.490
<v Speaker 3>the Gawker side argued the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2045
01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:40.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2046
01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:45.520
<v Speaker 3>there's a first amendment and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacred and we're journalists and we get </v>

2047
01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.720
<v Speaker 3>to do whatever we want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of.</v>

2048
01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:50.640
<v Speaker 3>And that was roughly their argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Hogan side of it was you published a</v>

2049
01:29:50.641 --> 01:29:55.641
<v Speaker 3>sex tape that was secretly taken in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>privacy of a bedroom and those are the </v>

2050
01:29:56.281 --> 01:29:58.620
<v Speaker 3>facts that has nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first amendment.</v>

2051
01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:00.750
<v Speaker 3>It might have something to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fourth amendment,</v>

2052
01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:02.730
<v Speaker 3>which is against unreasonable search and</v>
<v Speaker 3>seizure,</v>

2053
01:30:02.970 --> 01:30:07.020
<v Speaker 3>not just by government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also by private people obviously.</v>

2054
01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.750
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2055
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.400
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

2056
01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:12.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so yet,</v>

2057
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:17.660
<v Speaker 3>is there a conflict?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can there be a conflict between freedom </v>

2058
01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.200
<v Speaker 3>of speech and right to privacy probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>are cases where in theory there could be</v>

2059
01:30:19.201 --> 01:30:24.201
<v Speaker 3>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this was one where it was simply a </v>

2060
01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:24.201
<v Speaker 3>violation of privacy.</v>

2061
01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:27.210
<v Speaker 3>And I would say it wasn't speech at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

2062
01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.320
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2063
01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:32.880
<v Speaker 3>are all sorts of like super agregious </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts that came out in trial,</v>

2064
01:30:32.881 --> 01:30:33.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

2065
01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:37.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reporters and the editors had</v>

2066
01:30:37.441 --> 01:30:40.350
<v Speaker 3>posted the sex tape and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2067
01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:42.140
<v Speaker 3>he had a deposition with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2068
01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:43.030
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2069
01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:44.150
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2070
01:30:45.150 --> 01:30:47.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a one day long deposition,</v>

2071
01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.380
<v Speaker 3>a few years before the trial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2072
01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:50.400
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2073
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:51.230
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2074
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:52.350
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

2076
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:56.100
<v Speaker 3>j Dilla area came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reeking of marijuana,</v>

2077
01:30:56.490 --> 01:30:57.040
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2078
01:30:57.070 --> 01:30:58.020
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not against it,</v>

2079
01:30:58.021 --> 01:30:59.370
<v Speaker 3>but I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it on your show.</v>

2080
01:30:59.371 --> 01:31:02.130
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little of a legal deposition either.</v>

2081
01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:03.680
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2082
01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:04.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2083
01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:09.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Lord on our side as to is there any </v>

2084
01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:12.330
<v Speaker 3>sex tape you wouldn't publish little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it would involve the child.</v>

2085
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.950
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what age child?</v>

2086
01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:18.360
<v Speaker 3>A four year old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you show that to the jury,</v>

2087
01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:21.090
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty devastating.</v>

2088
01:31:21.091 --> 01:31:23.730
<v Speaker 3>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of these things where,</v>

2089
01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2090
01:31:26.050 --> 01:31:27.180
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that if,</v>

2091
01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:30.150
<v Speaker 3>if Mr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Terry Bollea Hulk Hogan,</v>

2092
01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:33.900
<v Speaker 3>if he ever had his day in court,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was going to be a runaway effect.</v>

2093
01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:37.430
<v Speaker 3>It was going to be completely run away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2094
01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.080
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

2095
01:31:39.081 --> 01:31:40.020
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's in effect,</v>

2096
01:31:40.021 --> 01:31:44.140
<v Speaker 3>what happened the last day of the trial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charles harder on,</v>

2097
01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:48.060
<v Speaker 3>he thought he thought that the largest </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of money you could ask for with a</v>

2098
01:31:48.061 --> 01:31:53.061
<v Speaker 3>straight face was $100,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after seven hours the jury </v>

2099
01:31:53.061 --> 01:31:55.380
<v Speaker 3>comes back with 115.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was just,</v>

2100
01:31:55.381 --> 01:31:57.600
<v Speaker 3>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just a runaway thing.</v>

2101
01:31:57.601 --> 01:31:59.290
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was,</v>

2102
01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 3>you can argue</v>

2103
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.320
<v Speaker 1>that it was too much for this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

2104
01:32:02.321 --> 01:32:04.660
<v Speaker 1>but in some ways it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2105
01:32:04.661 --> 01:32:07.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a million posts they've published</v>

2106
01:32:07.061 --> 01:32:09.700
<v Speaker 1>over the years that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was what was really at stake.</v>

2107
01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2108
01:32:10.121 --> 01:32:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that,</v>

2109
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:14.020
<v Speaker 1>that like you and defend you on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say,</v>

2110
01:32:14.021 --> 01:32:16.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a defense of free speech.</v>

2111
01:32:16.871 --> 01:32:21.130
<v Speaker 1>It was a defense of just the media </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming after everybody,</v>

2112
01:32:21.131 --> 01:32:26.131
<v Speaker 1>finding out anything you've ever done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding out any access to any picture </v>

2113
01:32:26.131 --> 01:32:30.331
<v Speaker 1>you've ever sent or any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we see the way this is sort of </v>

2114
01:32:30.331 --> 01:32:34.111
<v Speaker 1>infecting everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that simple argument to make,</v>

2115
01:32:34.511 --> 01:32:39.070
<v Speaker 1>but the way I would argue is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to have vigorous debate.</v>

2116
01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:41.980
<v Speaker 1>We need to have people with heterodox </v>
<v Speaker 1>views,</v>

2117
01:32:41.981 --> 01:32:45.670
<v Speaker 1>be able to articulate things and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2118
01:32:45.671 --> 01:32:49.330
<v Speaker 1>you can silence people by not letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them speak,</v>

2119
01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:54.720
<v Speaker 1>but you can also silence them by if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say something that's even slightly out </v>

2120
01:32:55.331 --> 01:33:00.331
<v Speaker 1>of line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to send the hate mob and </v>

2121
01:33:00.331 --> 01:33:01.980
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make up stories about you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2122
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2123
01:33:02.650 --> 01:33:04.090
<v Speaker 1>and personally destroy you.</v>

2124
01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And in a way that was the logic of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the hate factory,</v>

2125
01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:11.260
<v Speaker 1>the scapegoating machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was Gawker.</v>

2126
01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2127
01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:17.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways the victims were picked at </v>

2128
01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:17.520
<v Speaker 1>random and in some ways they were not at</v>
<v Speaker 1>random.</v>

2129
01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:22.381
<v Speaker 1>In some ways they were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonconformists they were the people </v>

2130
01:33:22.381 --> 01:33:24.340
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with views that were sort of heterodox.</v>

2131
01:33:24.341 --> 01:33:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that's one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2132
01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:31.560
<v Speaker 1>they targeted me and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not targeted more than some other </v>

2133
01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:32.210
<v Speaker 1>people hurt even more than I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2134
01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.500
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2135
01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:38.560
<v Speaker 1>it was very often people who said things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were just a little bit outside the </v>

2136
01:33:38.741 --> 01:33:41.640
<v Speaker 1>zone and then they were destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the lesson was,</v>

2137
01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:43.600
<v Speaker 1>was one of silencing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2138
01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.270
<v Speaker 1>So we should talk a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them targeting you.</v>

2139
01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.920
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in effect,</v>

2140
01:33:47.921 --> 01:33:49.060
<v Speaker 1>they outed you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2141
01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that where they officially the ones </v>

2142
01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:54.120
<v Speaker 1>that Audi?</v>

2143
01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2144
01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even that history can be sort of</v>

2145
01:33:56.410 --> 01:33:57.550
<v Speaker 1>contested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2146
01:33:57.551 --> 01:33:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I know you were out privately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's hard to.</v>

2147
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of somewhat in between zone.</v>

2148
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2149
01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:06.310
<v Speaker 1>they targeted me repeatedly over year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

2150
01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.480
<v Speaker 1>it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2151
01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:10.390
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was various other articles on the,</v>

2152
01:34:10.391 --> 01:34:12.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

2153
01:34:12.491 --> 01:34:15.100
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we talk about outing,</v>

2154
01:34:15.130 --> 01:34:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never,</v>

2155
01:34:17.410 --> 01:34:21.400
<v Speaker 1>it's never a simply factual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never,</v>

2156
01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Peter or David or gay.</v>

2157
01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fyi,</v>

2158
01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:28.320
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2159
01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:33.490
<v Speaker 1>it's more like a Peter Teal is gay and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea why he didn't want us to</v>

2160
01:34:33.491 --> 01:34:38.491
<v Speaker 1>talk about it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because maybe it's because </v>

2161
01:34:38.491 --> 01:34:42.311
<v Speaker 1>his parents don't know and they'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed or maybe it's because he's </v>

2162
01:34:42.311 --> 01:34:44.350
<v Speaker 1>trying to get money out of Saudi Arabia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2163
01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:47.830
<v Speaker 1>and we don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know why.</v>

2164
01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:49.480
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2165
01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:54.600
<v Speaker 1>so outing is always the way it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it happens actually much less,</v>

2166
01:34:54.941 --> 01:34:59.941
<v Speaker 1>but the way it worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always involved a description of </v>

2167
01:34:59.941 --> 01:35:03.871
<v Speaker 1>someone's sexual orientation and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of how psychologically </v>

2168
01:35:03.871 --> 01:35:04.010
<v Speaker 1>messed up they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2169
01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Because they didn't want you to write </v>
<v Speaker 1>the article.</v>

2170
01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:11.230
<v Speaker 1>And the way I think our society has </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressed is that the word we have for </v>

2171
01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:16.230
<v Speaker 1>outing today is something like bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is shifted from the </v>

2172
01:35:17.091 --> 01:35:22.091
<v Speaker 1>psychology of the person being written </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to the psychology of the writer.</v>

2173
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:28.270
<v Speaker 1>And the question is why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you do something as nasty as </v>

2174
01:35:28.461 --> 01:35:29.540
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was.</v>

2175
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:33.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's a pretty powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a very big cultural shift.</v>

2176
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:35.450
<v Speaker 1>So in 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

2177
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.790
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2178
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:42.580
<v Speaker 1>when they went after me outing was still</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable in 2015 they went after the </v>

2179
01:35:44.091 --> 01:35:45.740
<v Speaker 1>cfo of Conde Nast.</v>

2180
01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2181
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:48.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2182
01:35:48.111 --> 01:35:50.210
<v Speaker 1>sort of who knows the story was even </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

2183
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:51.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2184
01:35:51.051 --> 01:35:52.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2185
01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.510
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2186
01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.190
<v Speaker 1>the response was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2187
01:35:55.191 --> 01:35:57.360
<v Speaker 1>that's an incredibly vicious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you a reporter?</v>

2188
01:35:57.361 --> 01:35:59.660
<v Speaker 1>So vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they so hateful?</v>

2189
01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.250
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with you to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of like linked to bullying,</v>

2190
01:36:04.410 --> 01:36:05.420
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullying,</v>

2191
01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:06.110
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these,</v>

2192
01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:07.560
<v Speaker 1>all these kinds of phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2193
01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:09.110
<v Speaker 1>so we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

2194
01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2195
01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I think things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2196
01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I think we have actually progressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2197
01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:17.390
<v Speaker 1>transparency doesn't always mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make things better.</v>

2198
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sometimes it's just,</v>

2199
01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:20.590
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2200
01:36:20.890 --> 01:36:23.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just an excuse for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for attacking people.</v>

2201
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that in your case that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was also directly linked to your </v>

2202
01:36:28.330 --> 01:36:31.301
<v Speaker 1>politics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you had been the exact same </v>

2203
01:36:31.301 --> 01:36:33.581
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are with the exact same resume and </v>

2204
01:36:33.581 --> 01:36:34.160
<v Speaker 1>it created the exact same companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you had been a lefty,</v>

2205
01:36:34.161 --> 01:36:37.700
<v Speaker 1>you had been playing ball the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want you to play ball,</v>

2206
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:39.950
<v Speaker 1>that why would they try to harm you?</v>

2207
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in effect they were trying to harm you </v>

2208
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.950
<v Speaker 1>one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why they,</v>

2209
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:45.500
<v Speaker 1>they do these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the,</v>

2210
01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:49.490
<v Speaker 1>the label bully is applicable here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me it's like,</v>

2211
01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:50.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the libertarian.</v>

2212
01:36:50.841 --> 01:36:54.130
<v Speaker 1>He some scary anti government guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how can we get him?</v>

2213
01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Adam.</v>

2214
01:36:55.850 --> 01:36:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's a fair estimation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2215
01:36:57.441 --> 01:36:59.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a factor.</v>

2216
01:36:59.811 --> 01:37:01.240
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2217
01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I think on some level we were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get paged.</v>

2218
01:37:03.351 --> 01:37:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Clothes just sounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2219
01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2220
01:37:04.941 --> 01:37:05.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2221
01:37:05.751 --> 01:37:06.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still,</v>

2222
01:37:07.230 --> 01:37:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I think you're being too charitable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a way because you're giving them</v>

2223
01:37:11.361 --> 01:37:16.361
<v Speaker 1>an ideological motive and you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were these principled leftwing </v>

2224
01:37:16.361 --> 01:37:18.390
<v Speaker 1>people who went after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2225
01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.440
<v Speaker 1>the bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing power structure that is a </v>

2226
01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:23.440
<v Speaker 1>principled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

2227
01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think they weren't even,</v>

2228
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:30.500
<v Speaker 1>they were more nihilistic than liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>or left wing and um,</v>

2229
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:31.280
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

2230
01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:34.190
<v Speaker 1>you could dress up the nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to blow somebody up,</v>

2231
01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:37.620
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna do some crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2232
01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:43.120
<v Speaker 1>attack on some random person and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to try to give it some thin </v>

2233
01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.900
<v Speaker 1>ideological gloss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it was just,</v>

2234
01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.640
<v Speaker 1>it was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2235
01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:51.880
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was run as like this crazy sweatshop </v>

2236
01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:51.880
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2237
01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:51.880
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2238
01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people were paid very little and </v>

2239
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>they were paid based on how many clicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got.</v>

2240
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>And so you had to come up</v>

2241
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:59.910
<v Speaker 3>with crazy sensational headlines and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then stories that uh,</v>

2242
01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:05.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes had a relationship with the </v>

2243
01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:05.120
<v Speaker 3>truth and sometimes didn't.</v>

2244
01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has really permeated the </v>

2245
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:08.490
<v Speaker 2>internet altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2246
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I look every week,</v>

2247
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:09.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson.</v>

2248
01:38:09.161 --> 01:38:14.161
<v Speaker 2>It's like every morning I wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like somebody writes something </v>

2249
01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:14.161
<v Speaker 2>awful about him that I know is not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

2250
01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:19.081
<v Speaker 2>And it's like they have every interest </v>
<v Speaker 2>in doing it because he will defend </v>

2251
01:38:19.081 --> 01:38:19.360
<v Speaker 2>himself bus driving clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2252
01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2253
01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:24.820
<v Speaker 3>I will still say that I think gawker was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some ways a singularly sociopathic </v>

2254
01:38:24.831 --> 01:38:29.831
<v Speaker 3>bullies and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it is true that there's a lot of </v>

2255
01:38:29.831 --> 01:38:32.270
<v Speaker 3>stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you characterize,</v>

2256
01:38:32.690 --> 01:38:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people discounted more.</v>

2257
01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:38.450
<v Speaker 3>It has less impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2258
01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in its heyday,</v>

2259
01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.780
<v Speaker 3>gawker had impact because they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were sociopathic,</v>

2260
01:38:44.781 --> 01:38:47.090
<v Speaker 3>they were bullying and people didn't see</v>
<v Speaker 3>it yet.</v>

2261
01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:50.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the devastating kind if you're,</v>

2262
01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:55.220
<v Speaker 3>if you try to bully someone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody says right away you're a </v>

2263
01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:56.600
<v Speaker 3>bully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might still be a bully,</v>

2264
01:38:56.601 --> 01:38:58.490
<v Speaker 3>but not as not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not gonna be that effective.</v>

2265
01:38:59.630 --> 01:39:00.890
<v Speaker 3>If you're bullying people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2266
01:39:00.891 --> 01:39:02.480
<v Speaker 3>this is just the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is Tuck,</v>

2267
01:39:02.481 --> 01:39:05.510
<v Speaker 3>this is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have cart wash.</v>

2268
01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:10.540
<v Speaker 3>And so gawker had carte blanche for many</v>
<v Speaker 3>years to destroy people in a way that I </v>

2269
01:39:11.271 --> 01:39:13.820
<v Speaker 3>think has gotten much less effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2270
01:39:13.821 --> 01:39:15.050
<v Speaker 3>it still happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still,</v>

2271
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:20.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have the hate mob form on </v>

2272
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:20.270
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of still versions of this.</v>

2273
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:20.280
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2274
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:21.230
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2275
01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:23.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's much less generative.</v>

2276
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:24.140
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>

2277
01:39:24.170 --> 01:39:29.170
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about sexuality for a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit because this isn't something that </v>

2278
01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:29.170
<v Speaker 2>you talk about that often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2279
01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:30.260
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about it privately a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

2280
01:39:30.710 --> 01:39:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2281
01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:33.770
<v Speaker 2>first off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're married,</v>

2282
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:36.290
<v Speaker 2>congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got married in the last year.</v>

2283
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:41.330
<v Speaker 2>How much of your sort of contrary in </v>
<v Speaker 2>view of the world,</v>

2284
01:39:41.331 --> 01:39:46.320
<v Speaker 2>just the way you see things differently </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think is linked to be engaged?</v>

2285
01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:51.321
<v Speaker 2>Because before just the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years where I think being gay has been </v>

2286
01:39:51.321 --> 01:39:55.421
<v Speaker 2>so attached to leftism gay used to mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun or different or politically </v>

2287
01:39:56.241 --> 01:40:01.241
<v Speaker 2>incorrect and making edgy jokes and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being at subversive clubs are all of</v>

2288
01:40:02.061 --> 01:40:07.061
<v Speaker 2>these other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was a and gains were really </v>

2289
01:40:07.061 --> 01:40:07.250
<v Speaker 2>about the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the whole point.</v>

2290
01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:09.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you now are sort of,</v>

2291
01:40:09.531 --> 01:40:14.531
<v Speaker 2>as I said at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the ultimate contrarian and I </v>

2292
01:40:14.531 --> 01:40:16.910
<v Speaker 2>wonder is there a link between that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality,</v>

2293
01:40:16.911 --> 01:40:17.390
<v Speaker 2>do you think?</v>

2294
01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:20.250
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to exaggerate and he's,</v>

2295
01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:21.910
<v Speaker 3>and he's such link.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2296
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:24.210
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2297
01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:27.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of myself as like,</v>

2298
01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:32.120
<v Speaker 3>there were sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always bad at or biography </v>

2299
01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:32.120
<v Speaker 3>yourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start that fire,</v>

2300
01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:35.790
<v Speaker 3>but I always think of myself as somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was both.</v>

2301
01:40:36.090 --> 01:40:39.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm a total insider and a total </v>
<v Speaker 3>outsider.</v>

2302
01:40:39.121 --> 01:40:39.960
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2303
01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.480
<v Speaker 3>straight a student,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2304
01:40:42.481 --> 01:40:47.481
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the elite university elite law </v>

2305
01:40:47.481 --> 01:40:47.481
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elite law firm track.</v>

2306
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2307
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:51.940
<v Speaker 3>it was a bit of a nerd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was um,</v>

2308
01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:53.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was uh,</v>

2309
01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 3>I was born</v>

2310
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.320
<v Speaker 1>in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrant to theu ,</v>

2311
01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2312
01:40:58.430 --> 01:41:00.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gay thing.</v>

2313
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
<v Speaker 1>So all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these ways that I was both an </v>

2314
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.840
<v Speaker 1>outsider and insider and probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some way,</v>

2315
01:41:08.150 --> 01:41:09.190
<v Speaker 1>some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff,</v>

2316
01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:10.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>summed up to,</v>

2317
01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:13.750
<v Speaker 1>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make me less,</v>

2318
01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:17.140
<v Speaker 1>less prone to just believing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>received wisdom.</v>

2319
01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:19.200
<v Speaker 1>But I know I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

2320
01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I would certainly not want to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything remotely like that,</v>

2321
01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:25.560
<v Speaker 1>that gay people have a privileged access</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the truth or,</v>

2322
01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:27.420
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that,</v>

2323
01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.050
<v Speaker 1>that seems kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2324
01:41:29.051 --> 01:41:33.910
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of years ago you go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican National Convention and uh,</v>

2325
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:39.270
<v Speaker 1>you talked about being gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had always been an Athema over </v>

2326
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.270
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2327
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.520
<v Speaker 1>what was the exact line that you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>said?</v>

2328
01:41:39.730 --> 01:41:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

2329
01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud to be a republican,</v>

2330
01:41:44.250 --> 01:41:45.970
<v Speaker 1>but most of all I'm proud to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

2331
01:41:46.630 --> 01:41:48.580
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it was,</v>

2332
01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2333
01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:52.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2334
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:54.520
<v Speaker 1>And so I think it functioned in both a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that,</v>

2335
01:41:54.521 --> 01:41:55.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2336
01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.510
<v Speaker 1>every American has an identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2337
01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:02.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not something we should ignore or </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally diminish and we should not make </v>

2338
01:42:02.861 --> 01:42:07.861
<v Speaker 1>it all important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was sort of trying to steer a </v>

2339
01:42:07.861 --> 01:42:07.861
<v Speaker 1>certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2340
01:42:07.861 --> 01:42:08.710
<v Speaker 1>middle course on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2341
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:11.500
<v Speaker 1>on identity politics where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2342
01:42:11.501 --> 01:42:11.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2343
01:42:12.150 --> 01:42:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very easy to go too far in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one direction or another.</v>

2344
01:42:16.570 --> 01:42:20.680
<v Speaker 1>You can even say that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all identity is fake.</v>

2345
01:42:20.681 --> 01:42:22.390
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all made up.</v>

2346
01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's wrong.</v>

2347
01:42:24.881 --> 01:42:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I think there was an African American </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

2348
01:42:26.591 --> 01:42:29.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a female experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a gay experience and they are,</v>

2349
01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:31.780
<v Speaker 1>they are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2350
01:42:31.781 --> 01:42:32.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course there's,</v>

2351
01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an equally bad mistake of,</v>

2352
01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.470
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of making it all important,</v>

2353
01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

2354
01:42:39.521 --> 01:42:41.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all there is,</v>

2355
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:42.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what defines you.</v>

2356
01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.310
<v Speaker 1>And then it ends up becoming more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight jacket.</v>

2357
01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:45.790
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2358
01:42:45.930 --> 01:42:48.190
<v Speaker 1>the gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gay metaphor that I've used is that,</v>

2359
01:42:48.191 --> 01:42:49.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2360
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:51.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be in the closet,</v>

2361
01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:57.130
<v Speaker 1>you can be in the ghetto and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are mutually exclusive,</v>

2362
01:42:57.490 --> 01:43:01.270
<v Speaker 1>but I hope they're not exhaustive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something in between.</v>

2363
01:43:01.271 --> 01:43:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because those two are pretty good.</v>

2364
01:43:02.981 --> 01:43:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Something that's neither,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither of those two.</v>

2365
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you said that would be the </v>

2366
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.870
<v Speaker 1>closet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be in the ghetto.</v>

2367
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you said that line and then got </v>

2368
01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:12.960
<v Speaker 1>bad ovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first off,</v>

2369
01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:17.521
<v Speaker 1>were you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you nervous to say that line </v>

2370
01:43:17.521 --> 01:43:17.521
<v Speaker 1>because that's no small feat just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have it in the speech and ready to go.</v>

2371
01:43:17.521 --> 01:43:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Here's your nervous to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2372
01:43:19.061 --> 01:43:22.060
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like speaking to 50,000</v>

2373
01:43:22.061 --> 01:43:27.061
<v Speaker 1>people or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a strange super adrenaline </v>

2374
01:43:27.061 --> 01:43:28.600
<v Speaker 1>type experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that particular line,</v>

2375
01:43:28.601 --> 01:43:33.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you got the applause and there </v>

2376
01:43:33.601 --> 01:43:33.601
<v Speaker 1>must've been some party that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it worked like,</v>

2377
01:43:33.601 --> 01:43:33.601
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

2378
01:43:33.601 --> 01:43:37.570
<v Speaker 1>or something has changed or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2379
01:43:37.571 --> 01:43:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

2380
01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the Republicans are that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti gay.</v>

2381
01:43:44.410 --> 01:43:47.150
<v Speaker 1>They don't think of that antibiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

2382
01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe maybe they were in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

2383
01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:51.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2384
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2385
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:53.930
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

2386
01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:56.570
<v Speaker 3>it was clear that this was not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

2387
01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:59.060
<v Speaker 3>This was not the hill they wanted to die</v>
<v Speaker 3>on in 2016.</v>

2388
01:43:59.061 --> 01:44:01.350
<v Speaker 3>And so somebody had to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2389
01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:02.300
<v Speaker 3>So unless I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2390
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.900
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2391
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.030
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it felt a little bit risky,</v>

2392
01:44:05.031 --> 01:44:06.740
<v Speaker 3>but I don't even want to exaggerate </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2393
01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:12.040
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would have been a very crazy </v>

2394
01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:12.040
<v Speaker 3>thing to say 20 years earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2395
01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's shift to some new ideas.</v>

2396
01:44:13.361 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 3>How about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you feel about that?</v>

2397
01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Through some new ideas.</v>

2398
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:19.790
<v Speaker 3>So seasteading is one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been interested in for years.</v>

2399
01:44:19.791 --> 01:44:24.791
<v Speaker 3>This idea that we're going to basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>create in effect states that are going </v>

2400
01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:29.621
<v Speaker 3>to be on platforms in the sea that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think are sort of going to be </v>

2401
01:44:29.621 --> 01:44:32.920
<v Speaker 3>libertarian utopias,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least that would be the general </v>

2402
01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:36.371
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it had a lot of momentum </v>

2403
01:44:36.371 --> 01:44:36.371
<v Speaker 3>behind it for awhile.</v>

2404
01:44:36.371 --> 01:44:38.300
<v Speaker 3>Then kind of went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some renewed interest in</v>

2405
01:44:38.301 --> 01:44:43.301
<v Speaker 3>it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What got you interested in this and </v>

2406
01:44:43.301 --> 01:44:43.301
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's it at now?</v>

2407
01:44:43.301 --> 01:44:43.340
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2408
01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.270
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2409
01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Milton Friedman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sort of knew Milton Friedman a little </v>

2410
01:44:49.630 --> 01:44:50.510
<v Speaker 3>bit and his grandson pot Patri Friedman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2411
01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:53.450
<v Speaker 3>someone got in touch with and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was super.</v>

2412
01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:57.800
<v Speaker 3>He sort of spearheaded this seasteading </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea probably about a decade ago now.</v>

2413
01:44:58.370 --> 01:45:01.970
<v Speaker 3>And it was sort of a creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

2414
01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.720
<v Speaker 3>interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2415
01:45:03.721 --> 01:45:08.721
<v Speaker 3>I gave it a small amount of funding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't one of the things I did that </v>

2416
01:45:08.721 --> 01:45:08.721
<v Speaker 3>much with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

2417
01:45:08.730 --> 01:45:11.960
<v Speaker 3>it's somehow an incredible nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2418
01:45:11.961 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's,</v>

2419
01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:18.400
<v Speaker 3>and it hits such a nerve because I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of starting a new country or </v>

2420
01:45:19.191 --> 01:45:23.930
<v Speaker 3>doing something new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It reminds people that,</v>

2421
01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:28.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we had to design a country from </v>

2422
01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 3>scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we designed the state of California from</v>

2423
01:45:29.571 --> 01:45:31.700
<v Speaker 3>scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be so different.</v>

2424
01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:33.370
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2425
01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:38.480
<v Speaker 3>there's all these sort of super corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 3>governance institutions we'd clean out </v>

2426
01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:38.610
<v Speaker 3>and we'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2427
01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:39.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2428
01:45:39.710 --> 01:45:41.960
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's a,</v>

2429
01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:44.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I called Utopian,</v>

2430
01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:46.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a thought experiment that,</v>

2431
01:45:46.521 --> 01:45:47.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2432
01:45:47.261 --> 01:45:50.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets that energizes people and gets them</v>

2433
01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:52.250
<v Speaker 3>to think about things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spoke at this,</v>

2434
01:45:52.251 --> 01:45:56.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm free market university in Guatemala </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and um,</v>

2435
01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:57.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they told me that the,</v>

2436
01:45:57.990 --> 01:46:02.990
<v Speaker 3>they had free speech on everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the one thing that you weren't </v>

2437
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:05.540
<v Speaker 3>allowed to speak about were things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>seasteading or scarring countries reason</v>

2438
01:46:05.541 --> 01:46:10.541
<v Speaker 3>you weren't allowed to speak about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that if you started people to talk </v>

2439
01:46:10.541 --> 01:46:11.080
<v Speaker 3>about anything else and it's because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2440
01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:12.890
<v Speaker 3>it's because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always such a,</v>

2441
01:46:13.190 --> 01:46:18.190
<v Speaker 3>such a powerful hook and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are questions about whether it </v>

2442
01:46:18.190 --> 01:46:22.151
<v Speaker 3>will be allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to sort of get probably </v>

2443
01:46:22.151 --> 01:46:22.151
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some local promotion.</v>

2444
01:46:22.151 --> 01:46:24.800
<v Speaker 3>There's a question on how </v>
<v Speaker 3>technologically feasible it is.</v>

2445
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:29.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's sort of a pilot program that </v>

2446
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.050
<v Speaker 3>they're working with French Polynesia </v>
<v Speaker 3>and starting,</v>

2447
01:46:30.051 --> 01:46:33.920
<v Speaker 3>it's still somewhere in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the intermediate stage,</v>

2448
01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:34.610
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2449
01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:40.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see perhaps seeing if you can </v>

2450
01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:40.060
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can get political autonomy,</v>

2451
01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:42.980
<v Speaker 3>the assumptions you would do things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are very different.</v>

2452
01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:44.890
<v Speaker 3>I do medical tourism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might do,</v>

2453
01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:50.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be all sorts of offshore </v>

2454
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:50.280
<v Speaker 3>banking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do all kinds of that one might</v>

2455
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.490
<v Speaker 1>be able to do differently and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2456
01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the link to a link to,</v>

2457
01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:57.540
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2458
01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.610
<v Speaker 1>to technology that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2459
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:02.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think he's a,</v>

2460
01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:07.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let a lot of these different micro </v>

2461
01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:07.940
<v Speaker 1>states bloom and you'd sort of see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>would come out of.</v>

2462
01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:11.520
<v Speaker 1>But the specific technological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific,</v>

2463
01:47:11.521 --> 01:47:16.521
<v Speaker 1>technological thing that I think could </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out of some new political </v>

2464
01:47:16.521 --> 01:47:20.931
<v Speaker 1>arrangements at some point is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>this question whether we could get new </v>

2465
01:47:20.931 --> 01:47:22.200
<v Speaker 1>medicines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new drugs,</v>

2466
01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:23.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2467
01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you have something where you use </v>

2468
01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:33.920
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin or MDM as an antidepressant </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug or can you get,</v>

2469
01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:36.510
<v Speaker 1>can you get new?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2470
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:42.200
<v Speaker 1>can you get a new medical treatments </v>
<v Speaker 1>through where you sort of break the FDA </v>

2471
01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:44.850
<v Speaker 1>monopoly on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on medicine worldwide?</v>

2472
01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:49.560
<v Speaker 1>So basically you would see all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different units sort of having different</v>

2473
01:47:49.561 --> 01:47:54.561
<v Speaker 1>rules that they live by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of as an experiment to see what </v>

2474
01:47:54.561 --> 01:47:54.561
<v Speaker 1>would work is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2475
01:47:54.561 --> 01:47:54.990
<v Speaker 1>that's one level.</v>

2476
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:58.710
<v Speaker 1>But then the specific thing that I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the general abstract hold,</v>

2477
01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:03.740
<v Speaker 1>the specific thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hope would come out of it would </v>

2478
01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:06.891
<v Speaker 1>be more scientific and technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress that's too heavily regulated by</v>

2479
01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:11.250
<v Speaker 1>the heavy hand of our existing state and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are all these things we can't</v>

2480
01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:16.251
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's all sorts of things of </v>

2481
01:48:16.251 --> 01:48:18.291
<v Speaker 1>governance might be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might have different penal system or </v>

2482
01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:19.290
<v Speaker 1>don't have millions of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>incarcerated.</v>

2483
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:21.810
<v Speaker 1>There are all sorts of things one might </v>
<v Speaker 1>do very differently.</v>

2484
01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:27.040
<v Speaker 1>The specific one that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm probably most tracked who's </v>

2485
01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:28.260
<v Speaker 1>this is this question of whether we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do new biomedical things.</v>

2486
01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could do three hours just on this,</v>

2487
01:48:31.621 --> 01:48:33.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's only one more question on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2488
01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:37.290
<v Speaker 1>how do you decide who gets in on this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you decide who can,</v>

2489
01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:39.120
<v Speaker 1>who can live there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can be part of this?</v>

2490
01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is purely a financial move.</v>

2491
01:48:41.371 --> 01:48:43.050
<v Speaker 1>If you've got enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good to go.</v>

2492
01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Or do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you trying to build a society and </v>

2493
01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.350
<v Speaker 1>picking all sorts of other people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things get you had to make </v>

2494
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:52.230
<v Speaker 1>all these decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to make these decisions,</v>

2495
01:48:52.231 --> 01:48:54.050
<v Speaker 1>you get to make these decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's uh,</v>

2496
01:48:54.630 --> 01:48:56.430
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2497
01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:01.960
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always sort of one of the </v>

2498
01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:02.470
<v Speaker 1>foundational decisions in the society </v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

2499
01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:04.920
<v Speaker 1>who's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we define it?</v>

2500
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:07.350
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2501
01:49:07.351 --> 01:49:10.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be unfair and oppressive if,</v>

2502
01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:15.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have just one society and if </v>

2503
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:15.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're nowhere.</v>

2504
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:18.330
<v Speaker 1>But if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have many of these places,</v>

2505
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:20.010
<v Speaker 1>that's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2506
01:49:20.011 --> 01:49:25.011
<v Speaker 1>And so the pushback on this is then that</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow this means you don't like </v>

2507
01:49:25.011 --> 01:49:27.630
<v Speaker 1>America or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I,</v>

2508
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:29.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2509
01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:30.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2510
01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly think that if we have </v>

2511
01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:35.480
<v Speaker 1>competition governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2512
01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:35.480
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would do a lot better.</v>

2513
01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2514
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:37.070
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's move ahead.</v>

2515
01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:41.520
<v Speaker 1>So a flying cars a lot is against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2516
01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:46.580
<v Speaker 1>He's building an underground tunnel in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this very city where he out on the fly </v>

2517
01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 1>of cars these days because we had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had the,</v>

2518
01:49:47.490 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 1>it was a tagline</v>

2519
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.270
<v Speaker 3>we had on our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2520
01:49:49.630 --> 01:49:50.980
<v Speaker 3>on our venture capital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2521
01:49:50.981 --> 01:49:51.800
<v Speaker 3>website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2522
01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:52.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2523
01:49:52.791 --> 01:49:57.791
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they promised us flying cars and all we </v>

2524
01:49:57.791 --> 01:49:58.660
<v Speaker 3>got was 140 characters sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to 80 now.</v>

2525
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it was,</v>

2526
01:50:02.321 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2527
01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:06.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was more a commentary on,</v>

2528
01:50:06.551 --> 01:50:11.551
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a technology that we were promised </v>

2529
01:50:11.551 --> 01:50:15.010
<v Speaker 3>these massive breakthroughs that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>transform the way the world works.</v>

2530
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:19.680
<v Speaker 3>And then we got sort of incremental </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication technologies but not,</v>

2531
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.830
<v Speaker 3>not world transforming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I do think flying cars will be,</v>

2532
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:25.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be a good thing.</v>

2533
01:50:25.631 --> 01:50:30.631
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Ellen's objection was they were </v>

2534
01:50:30.631 --> 01:50:32.161
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too noisy and then of course the </v>

2535
01:50:32.161 --> 01:50:32.161
<v Speaker 3>question is can you design them so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not so noisy?</v>

2536
01:50:32.161 --> 01:50:33.490
<v Speaker 3>So there's always sort of what are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the actual limits on,</v>

2537
01:50:33.810 --> 01:50:35.770
<v Speaker 3>on the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the um,</v>

2538
01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:40.660
<v Speaker 3>but the sort of iconic for can we have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jetson's future?</v>

2539
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Can we have a future where things look </v>
<v Speaker 3>really different?</v>

2540
01:50:44.050 --> 01:50:49.050
<v Speaker 3>And the striking thing is that we live </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a world that doesn't look that </v>

2541
01:50:49.050 --> 01:50:50.140
<v Speaker 3>different from the 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2542
01:50:50.141 --> 01:50:50.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2543
01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:51.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2544
01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:56.120
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at screens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're distracted by our iphones all the </v>

2545
01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:59.881
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the iphones that distract us from </v>

2546
01:50:59.881 --> 01:51:03.001
<v Speaker 3>our environment also distract us from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way in which our environment </v>

2547
01:51:03.001 --> 01:51:07.080
<v Speaker 3>strangely hasn't changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're running maybe writing a 100 year </v>

2548
01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:08.930
<v Speaker 3>old subway in New York City or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

2549
01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:14.340
<v Speaker 3>the zoning laws mean that the cities </v>
<v Speaker 3>like San Francisco looked like they </v>

2550
01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:17.881
<v Speaker 3>haven't changed in 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that technologically advanced San </v>

2551
01:51:17.881 --> 01:51:18.180
<v Speaker 3>Francisco is getting so expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to leave.</v>

2552
01:51:18.181 --> 01:51:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the precise reason,</v>

2553
01:51:20.381 --> 01:51:21.130
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2554
01:51:21.131 --> 01:51:21.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2555
01:51:22.110 --> 01:51:23.240
<v Speaker 3>but it basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2556
01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:25.390
<v Speaker 3>so it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we,</v>

2557
01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.690
<v Speaker 3>can we have more technological progress </v>
<v Speaker 3>than we have?</v>

2558
01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:30.530
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2559
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:31.160
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

2560
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:32.530
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

2561
01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:34.210
<v Speaker 3>the sort of iconic image.</v>

2562
01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:39.210
<v Speaker 3>I always have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had the two back to the future </v>

2563
01:51:39.210 --> 01:51:39.210
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first one,</v>

2564
01:51:39.210 --> 01:51:42.900
<v Speaker 3>they went from 85 to 1955 and things had</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed a lot from 1955 to 1985.</v>

2565
01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:49.870
<v Speaker 3>The second one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went from 1985 to what they thought</v>

2566
01:51:49.871 --> 01:51:51.860
<v Speaker 3>2015 would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to have like,</v>

2567
01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:56.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all it was going to like this crazy </v>

2568
01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:59.311
<v Speaker 3>different world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the reality is the world of </v>

2569
01:51:59.311 --> 01:51:59.311
<v Speaker 3>Twenty 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2570
01:51:59.311 --> 01:52:03.210
<v Speaker 3>looks much less different from the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>of 1985 and 85 was from 55.</v>

2571
01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:07.130
<v Speaker 3>So waiting for that hoverboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened to the hover ball?</v>

2572
01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:08.410
<v Speaker 3>All these kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2573
01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:09.960
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2574
01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:11.620
<v Speaker 3>and so there is sort of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2575
01:52:11.621 --> 01:52:13.270
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that,</v>

2576
01:52:13.271 --> 01:52:14.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

2577
01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:19.380
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways our society works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways liberal democracy or </v>

2578
01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:24.030
<v Speaker 3>representative government works is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a scientific technological </v>

2579
01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:25.180
<v Speaker 3>progress going on in the background.</v>

2580
01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:27.190
<v Speaker 3>You have growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pie is growing.</v>

2581
01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:30.970
<v Speaker 3>If the pie grows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can find creative ways to,</v>

2582
01:52:30.971 --> 01:52:35.971
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shift the pieces that everybody gets </v>

2583
01:52:35.971 --> 01:52:35.971
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2584
01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:39.220
<v Speaker 3>when the Pi stops growing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there is no progress,</v>

2585
01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:44.290
<v Speaker 3>then you end up with this polarized </v>
<v Speaker 3>world with the zero sum politics.</v>

2586
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Know for every winner there's a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who succeeds is suspected of </v>

2587
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:51.560
<v Speaker 3>being part of some kind of a racket or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2588
01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:52.660
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2589
01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:56.030
<v Speaker 3>and so I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there is actually a pretty,</v>

2590
01:52:56.031 --> 01:52:57.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2591
01:52:57.460 --> 01:53:00.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a link pretty deep link between </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2592
01:53:00.861 --> 01:53:05.861
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question of scientific and </v>

2593
01:53:05.861 --> 01:53:05.861
<v Speaker 3>technological progress and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2594
01:53:05.861 --> 01:53:07.670
<v Speaker 3>the health of our sort of representative</v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy.</v>

2595
01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:08.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2596
01:53:08.541 --> 01:53:09.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good segue to,</v>

2597
01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:11.810
<v Speaker 3>to Ai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we've talked about this a little</v>

2598
01:53:11.811 --> 01:53:13.710
<v Speaker 3>bit and you've told me something once </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I,</v>

2599
01:53:13.711 --> 01:53:18.711
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually not sure if you've said </v>

2600
01:53:18.711 --> 01:53:20.141
<v Speaker 3>publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's pretty on point that </v>

2601
01:53:20.141 --> 01:53:22.511
<v Speaker 3>basically if you're an authoritarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be for ai and libertarians </v>

2602
01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:24.190
<v Speaker 3>are sort of against the.</v>

2603
01:53:24.190 --> 01:53:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I am I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I getting that roughly correct?</v>

2604
01:53:25.981 --> 01:53:30.981
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the best sound bite was on </v>

2605
01:53:30.981 --> 01:53:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Bitcoin if crypto is libertarian than ai</v>
<v Speaker 3>as communists.</v>

2606
01:53:32.841 --> 01:53:37.841
<v Speaker 3>So everyone thinks of crypto is </v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarian because you have all these </v>

2607
01:53:37.841 --> 01:53:39.560
<v Speaker 3>ideas about decentralizing money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like this.</v>

2608
01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:43.040
<v Speaker 3>Nobody says ai is communist and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're sort of,</v>

2609
01:53:43.110 --> 01:53:48.110
<v Speaker 3>we're more conscious of people with </v>
<v Speaker 3>different views like libertarian and </v>

2610
01:53:48.110 --> 01:53:51.011
<v Speaker 3>were less conscious of people with </v>
<v Speaker 3>collectivist views because that's sort </v>

2611
01:53:51.011 --> 01:53:52.260
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's more the Zeitgeists but uh,</v>

2612
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:57.310
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think ai crypto versus ai dichotomy </v>

2613
01:53:58.460 --> 01:54:03.460
<v Speaker 3>goes to the sort of question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the future of the computer age </v>

2614
01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:03.780
<v Speaker 3>going to look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2615
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:08.120
<v Speaker 3>and is it going to be more centralized </v>
<v Speaker 3>or more decentralized?</v>

2616
01:54:08.150 --> 01:54:11.330
<v Speaker 3>We hit that thing about the history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had these very different pictures.</v>

2617
01:54:11.331 --> 01:54:13.160
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the late sixties,</v>

2618
01:54:13.161 --> 01:54:16.130
<v Speaker 3>the early star trek episodes you had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was one planet,</v>

2619
01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:21.160
<v Speaker 3>they got to where there was one big </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer that ran the whole planet had </v>

2620
01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.071
<v Speaker 3>been running it for 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years and people didn't have any </v>

2621
01:54:24.071 --> 01:54:24.071
<v Speaker 3>thoughts.</v>

2622
01:54:24.071 --> 01:54:25.460
<v Speaker 3>They're all sort of docile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of happy.</v>

2623
01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Nothing ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was what people thought the </v>

2624
01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:33.311
<v Speaker 3>future would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the late sixties when we centralized </v>

2625
01:54:33.311 --> 01:54:36.401
<v Speaker 3>big computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the late nineties it was going to be </v>

2626
01:54:36.401 --> 01:54:38.390
<v Speaker 3>crypto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was going to be decentralized,</v>

2627
01:54:38.391 --> 01:54:43.391
<v Speaker 3>the Internet was going to split up all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these sort of structures and that was </v>

2628
01:54:43.391 --> 01:54:48.190
<v Speaker 3>like 1998,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's sort of let's say 68 with </v>

2629
01:54:48.190 --> 01:54:49.800
<v Speaker 3>centralized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>98 was decentralized 2018.</v>

2630
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:53.300
<v Speaker 3>In some ways the pendulum has swung back</v>
<v Speaker 3>to centralize this big governments,</v>

2631
01:54:53.301 --> 01:54:58.301
<v Speaker 3>big databases that can monitor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>survey people and know more about you </v>

2632
01:54:58.301 --> 01:55:00.140
<v Speaker 3>than you know about yourself or things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2633
01:55:00.141 --> 01:55:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Sort of creepy big brother type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>

2634
01:55:03.370 --> 01:55:08.370
<v Speaker 3>I think since the pendulum has swung </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth so much over the last 50 </v>

2635
01:55:08.370 --> 01:55:13.241
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason that that's the </v>

2636
01:55:13.241 --> 01:55:13.241
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually a choice.</v>

2637
01:55:13.241 --> 01:55:16.991
<v Speaker 3>Do we want it to be centralized?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we want it to be decentralized and </v>

2638
01:55:16.991 --> 01:55:21.920
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I think ai can mean many different </v>

2639
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:24.881
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it means that you have large </v>

2640
01:55:24.881 --> 01:55:27.050
<v Speaker 3>databases that are controlled by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

2641
01:55:27.051 --> 01:55:30.170
<v Speaker 3>a large government that can monitor </v>
<v Speaker 3>people more effectively,</v>

2642
01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:35.720
<v Speaker 3>it's something that could make communism</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe more effective,</v>

2643
01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:40.900
<v Speaker 3>certainly more scary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more totalitarian than it ever was in </v>

2644
01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:41.500
<v Speaker 3>the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

2645
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I do think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not a coincidence along</v>

2646
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:49.070
<v Speaker 1>these lines that the Chinese Communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Party hates crypto and won't say ai and,</v>

2647
01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:50.440
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2648
01:55:50.450 --> 01:55:50.950
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2649
01:55:51.090 --> 01:55:52.620
<v Speaker 1>ai means something a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2650
01:55:52.621 --> 01:55:54.470
<v Speaker 1>What it means in a silicon valley </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

2651
01:55:54.471 --> 01:55:55.770
<v Speaker 1>We're in silicon valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ai Off</v>

2652
01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:57.080
<v Speaker 3>just means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2653
01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:57.890
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2654
01:55:58.060 --> 01:56:02.030
<v Speaker 3>a super smart computer that will leave </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the humans behind in China.</v>

2655
01:56:02.210 --> 01:56:03.720
<v Speaker 3>It means a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2656
01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:04.170
<v Speaker 3>a</v>

2657
01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:08.430
<v Speaker 1>really smart computer that helps a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans control the rest.</v>

2658
01:56:08.650 --> 01:56:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it almost seems like we're going to </v>

2659
01:56:13.650 --> 01:56:15.081
<v Speaker 1>splinter off into two versions of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we'll have these two tracks </v>

2660
01:56:15.081 --> 01:56:18.621
<v Speaker 1>that'll be side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the people are really going to be </v>

2661
01:56:18.621 --> 01:56:21.411
<v Speaker 1>into this sort of centralized idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and the ease that ai will allow </v>

2662
01:56:21.411 --> 01:56:22.860
<v Speaker 1>you to get products or whatever else it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2663
01:56:23.010 --> 01:56:28.010
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll have this other group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who maybe who are into all the </v>

2664
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:28.830
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrencies and all that who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of,</v>

2665
01:56:30.110 --> 01:56:35.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose are operating outside of the </v>

2666
01:56:35.110 --> 01:56:35.110
<v Speaker 1>system or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2667
01:56:35.110 --> 01:56:35.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2668
01:56:35.370 --> 01:56:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2669
01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:42.300
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible these things can be </v>

2670
01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:44.810
<v Speaker 1>overlapping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also possible can go much more </v>

2671
01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:47.631
<v Speaker 1>one way or the other that it can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately that the future can be more </v>

2672
01:56:47.631 --> 01:56:48.630
<v Speaker 1>decentralized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are more centralized,</v>

2673
01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:50.630
<v Speaker 1>it can be more capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more communist,</v>

2674
01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:53.790
<v Speaker 1>more libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more totalitarian.</v>

2675
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:54.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2676
01:56:54.691 --> 01:56:57.340
<v Speaker 1>so I think it can go and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2677
01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:59.110
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different ways and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>info.</v>

2678
01:56:59.210 --> 01:57:04.210
<v Speaker 1>This is why these debates are important </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's up to us to decide which </v>

2679
01:57:04.210 --> 01:57:06.980
<v Speaker 1>technologies do we push and which ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2680
01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:08.350
<v Speaker 1>are we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we maybe,</v>

2681
01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:13.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be a little more careful </v>

2682
01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:13.400
<v Speaker 1>and I think you should outlaw ai are </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulated.</v>

2683
01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:13.680
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2684
01:57:14.010 --> 01:57:15.180
<v Speaker 3>but I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2685
01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:16.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2686
01:57:16.591 --> 01:57:18.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

2687
01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:21.750
<v Speaker 1>the certainly are other technologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would like to do better,</v>

2688
01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:26.840
<v Speaker 1>so I know you're not in the well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are some of those technologies or </v>

2689
01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:27.990
<v Speaker 1>something like the mainland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the contrast example?</v>

2690
01:57:27.991 --> 01:57:32.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know that a huge percentage of my </v>

2691
01:57:32.991 --> 01:57:35.211
<v Speaker 1>audience just because they know all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>craziness I've been through with </v>

2692
01:57:35.211 --> 01:57:38.211
<v Speaker 1>demonetization and I'm always </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining about the algorithm and our </v>

2693
01:57:38.211 --> 01:57:41.031
<v Speaker 1>video's not going to feeds and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things and that we've just sort </v>

2694
01:57:41.031 --> 01:57:41.400
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just don't know what's going on.</v>

2695
01:57:41.401 --> 01:57:42.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2696
01:57:42.421 --> 01:57:47.421
<v Speaker 1>my feelings on this about I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government telling these companies </v>

2697
01:57:47.421 --> 01:57:50.811
<v Speaker 1>what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would like a little more </v>

2698
01:57:50.811 --> 01:57:50.811
<v Speaker 1>transparency out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the government.</v>

2699
01:57:50.811 --> 01:57:55.011
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know what's Kinda going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the algorithms and things like </v>

2700
01:57:55.011 --> 01:57:58.131
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any way we could know more </v>

2701
01:57:58.131 --> 01:57:58.530
<v Speaker 1>about these algorithms and things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are giving us all this information?</v>

2702
01:57:58.531 --> 01:58:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Or is that just there's reasons why we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't know all of that?</v>

2703
01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure if I framed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question correctly.</v>

2704
01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2705
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always have to be careful here since </v>

2706
01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the board and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2707
01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:10.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2708
01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:13.020
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I certainly think that,</v>

2709
01:58:13.050 --> 01:58:14.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2710
01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:15.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my judgment,</v>

2711
01:58:15.891 --> 01:58:16.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2712
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:22.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook has been given a bit more of a </v>

2713
01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:22.740
<v Speaker 3>bum rap than it deserves on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2714
01:58:22.770 --> 01:58:23.980
<v Speaker 3>on many of these scores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2715
01:58:24.810 --> 01:58:26.250
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that,</v>

2716
01:58:26.251 --> 01:58:27.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think,</v>

2717
01:58:27.631 --> 01:58:29.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is this,</v>

2718
01:58:29.321 --> 01:58:32.340
<v Speaker 3>this question is going to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2719
01:58:32.370 --> 01:58:33.030
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2720
01:58:33.530 --> 01:58:37.230
<v Speaker 3>does silicon valley discriminating </v>
<v Speaker 3>against certain voices?</v>

2721
01:58:37.231 --> 01:58:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Is it um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the algorithms in fact neutral or are</v>

2722
01:58:41.441 --> 01:58:42.310
<v Speaker 3>they coded</v>

2723
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:47.310
<v Speaker 1>to discriminate against conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian voices that are out a little</v>

2724
01:58:47.591 --> 01:58:52.591
<v Speaker 1>bit outside the mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think Silicon Valley is making a </v>

2725
01:58:52.781 --> 01:58:57.781
<v Speaker 1>mistake if it thinks that that question </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be sort of swept under the rug and </v>

2726
01:58:57.781 --> 01:58:57.810
<v Speaker 1>this is going to go away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2727
01:58:57.811 --> 01:59:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I think the question is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked with,</v>

2728
01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:01.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2729
01:59:01.071 --> 01:59:06.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more intensity in the years ahead and I </v>

2730
01:59:06.071 --> 01:59:06.071
<v Speaker 1>think people are either going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer it.</v>

2731
01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2732
01:59:07.151 --> 01:59:12.151
<v Speaker 1>So two more for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever think if 20 years ago </v>

2733
01:59:12.151 --> 01:59:13.350
<v Speaker 1>someone would have said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2734
01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:17.050
<v Speaker 1>teal in 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to leave silicon valley and</v>

2735
01:59:17.051 --> 01:59:19.030
<v Speaker 1>not only you're going to leave silicon </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley,</v>

2736
01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:21.970
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go to la for freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2737
01:59:21.971 --> 01:59:25.270
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go to La to escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find some free thinkers.</v>

2738
01:59:25.271 --> 01:59:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Now there's something interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in La Right now and it goes to</v>

2739
01:59:28.541 --> 01:59:29.950
<v Speaker 1>something that you referenced earlier.</v>

2740
01:59:30.190 --> 01:59:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Politics and media are sort of becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing and there is suddenly this new</v>

2741
01:59:33.911 --> 01:59:38.911
<v Speaker 1>home here have kind of free thinkers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are interested in politics and all </v>

2742
01:59:38.911 --> 01:59:42.241
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that you ended up here of </v>

2743
01:59:42.241 --> 01:59:44.791
<v Speaker 1>all places where this is thought of as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood and the liberal lefty elite </v>

2744
01:59:44.791 --> 01:59:49.260
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that seem crazy to you that of all </v>

2745
01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:50.300
<v Speaker 1>places you're going to end up here now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that way.</v>

2746
01:59:50.330 --> 01:59:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would have predicted it</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago.</v>

2747
01:59:52.301 --> 01:59:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2748
01:59:54.370 --> 01:59:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2749
01:59:55.150 --> 02:00:00.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of different </v>

2750
02:00:00.150 --> 02:00:00.680
<v Speaker 1>reasons when a chooses to live in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like bigger cities is something</v>

2751
02:00:00.690 --> 02:00:03.130
<v Speaker 1>that is sort of a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things you can do in big cities</v>

2752
02:00:03.131 --> 02:00:05.290
<v Speaker 1>you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in smaller places.</v>

2753
02:00:05.650 --> 02:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that our is a very </v>

2754
02:00:10.650 --> 02:00:11.440
<v Speaker 1>different field between Los Angeles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley.</v>

2755
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Is that a Los Angeles is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a weirdly,</v>

2756
02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>it is the big city that is weirdly </v>
<v Speaker 1>decentralized and it doesn't have a </v>

2757
02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2758
02:00:21.790 --> 02:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always complained about how bad </v>

2759
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>the traffic is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2760
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>one of the virtues of it is it's somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't.</v>

2761
02:00:28.450 --> 02:00:29.470
<v Speaker 1>It isn't like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2762
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>this intense manic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bubble like Manhattan or like a San </v>

2763
02:00:35.050 --> 02:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Francisco in silicon valley have become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2764
02:00:37.511 --> 02:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the superintendent's network effects you</v>

2765
02:00:40.421 --> 02:00:45.421
<v Speaker 1>have in Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm in Silicon Valley can be very </v>

2766
02:00:45.421 --> 02:00:48.220
<v Speaker 1>positive because it's like you sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate things,</v>

2767
02:00:48.221 --> 02:00:51.310
<v Speaker 1>you get ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then at some point you get a tipping</v>

2768
02:00:52.150 --> 02:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets crossed.</v>

2769
02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Where it goes with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes more negative,</v>

2770
02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>becomes group think loving like </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

2771
02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>The Madness of crowds and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my judgment is somehow a silicon </v>

2772
02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>valley's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2773
02:01:05.110 --> 02:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>jumped the shark just a little bit over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last few years that,</v>

2774
02:01:07.711 --> 02:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2775
02:01:08.370 --> 02:01:13.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very things that were positive got </v>

2776
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>pushed so far till they actually became </v>
<v Speaker 1>poisonous.</v>

2777
02:01:14.410 --> 02:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you get more support </v>

2778
02:01:19.410 --> 02:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>privately from some of your colleagues </v>
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>

2779
02:01:19.410 --> 02:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe publicly on something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where people,</v>

2780
02:01:21.010 --> 02:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>other ceos calling you and going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2781
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I get it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having trouble hiring qualified </v>

2782
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>people because of all of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2783
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2784
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>there's an economic look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole bunch of reasons.</v>

2785
02:01:30.670 --> 02:01:31.780
<v Speaker 1>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2786
02:01:31.781 --> 02:01:32.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2787
02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:33.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2788
02:01:33.611 --> 02:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2789
02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>the reductionist economic reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things have gotten less desirable.</v>

2790
02:01:39.230 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley has gotten</v>

2791
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:42.380
<v Speaker 3>too expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's $2,000</v>

2792
02:01:42.381 --> 02:01:45.980
<v Speaker 3>for one bedroom apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's like a boom town and that's</v>

2793
02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:48.860
<v Speaker 3>showing things are going well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's $4,000,</v>

2794
02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:53.270
<v Speaker 3>that's like just a crazy tax that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>should think twice about paying.</v>

2795
02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:54.680
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2796
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:55.940
<v Speaker 3>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

2797
02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:57.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2798
02:01:57.201 --> 02:01:58.700
<v Speaker 3>even on the nuts and bolts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

2799
02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:01.400
<v Speaker 3>if you're starting a new company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2800
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:02.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2801
02:02:02.241 --> 02:02:07.070
<v Speaker 3>six years ago it was clear and tech that</v>
<v Speaker 3>silicon valley was the right place to do</v>

2802
02:02:07.071 --> 02:02:10.850
<v Speaker 3>it because of all the network effects </v>
<v Speaker 3>and more capital and more talent.</v>

2803
02:02:10.851 --> 02:02:14.900
<v Speaker 3>And that sort of helped today I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's much more ambiguous.</v>

2804
02:02:14.901 --> 02:02:17.390
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean it's all going to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>to la or move some other place.</v>

2805
02:02:17.391 --> 02:02:22.391
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's gonna be much more </v>

2806
02:02:22.391 --> 02:02:22.391
<v Speaker 3>decentralized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2807
02:02:22.391 --> 02:02:26.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the very strange ironies or </v>

2808
02:02:26.210 --> 02:02:28.250
<v Speaker 3>paradoxes of the Internet age that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was supposed to,</v>

2809
02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:31.670
<v Speaker 3>the Internet was supposed to eliminate </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tyranny of place.</v>

2810
02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:32.770
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2811
02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:35.890
<v Speaker 3>and that it all was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all of it happened in this,</v>

2812
02:02:35.891 --> 02:02:38.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this narrow silicon valley area.</v>

2813
02:02:38.410 --> 02:02:38.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a.</v>

2814
02:02:39.170 --> 02:02:44.170
<v Speaker 3>remember there's a talk I gave at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Stanford University or a panel </v>

2815
02:02:44.170 --> 02:02:47.831
<v Speaker 3>discussion in two back in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the questions was where will </v>

2816
02:02:50.661 --> 02:02:54.800
<v Speaker 3>we find the next google?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a student audience,</v>

2817
02:02:54.810 --> 02:02:58.130
<v Speaker 3>the student union at Stanford and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a and so they were interested in</v>

2818
02:02:58.131 --> 02:03:01.580
<v Speaker 3>working for the next Google company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a search problem searching for</v>

2819
02:03:01.581 --> 02:03:04.130
<v Speaker 3>the next Google can't type into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Google search engine,</v>

2820
02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:06.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's really valuable to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2821
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:11.120
<v Speaker 3>And I sort of thought it sort of clever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly crypt against I gave was,</v>

2822
02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:16.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a 50 percent chance the </v>

2823
02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:16.730
<v Speaker 3>next google is within a five mile radius</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this room.</v>

2824
02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:19.610
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm narrowing the search problem.</v>

2825
02:03:19.670 --> 02:03:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Five mile radius was about maybe roughly</v>
<v Speaker 3>a millionth of the surface area of,</v>

2826
02:03:24.490 --> 02:03:25.410
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the resource,</v>

2827
02:03:25.490 --> 02:03:28.600
<v Speaker 3>reducing it by a factor of a million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem still pretty hard.</v>

2828
02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:31.400
<v Speaker 3>A lot of garages and things you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at within a five mile radius.</v>

2829
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:35.540
<v Speaker 3>And I think that was actually right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was that concentrated.</v>

2830
02:03:35.541 --> 02:03:40.541
<v Speaker 3>So the next Google was facebook and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was one point eight miles from that Rep.</v>

2831
02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:43.350
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2832
02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:45.110
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize it at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was,</v>

2833
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:47.990
<v Speaker 3>it was correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I had to give the same speech today,</v>

2834
02:03:48.650 --> 02:03:53.650
<v Speaker 3>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be a way less than 50 percent </v>

2835
02:03:53.650 --> 02:03:54.400
<v Speaker 3>within 50 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2836
02:03:54.590 --> 02:03:59.590
<v Speaker 3>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is going to be much more </v>

2837
02:03:59.590 --> 02:04:02.471
<v Speaker 3>decentralized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have the consensus has total </v>

2838
02:04:02.471 --> 02:04:04.340
<v Speaker 3>centralization and just as with ai and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Crypto,</v>

2839
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I'd be more in the crypto than the Ai </v>
<v Speaker 3>side in general.</v>

2840
02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.690
<v Speaker 3>I'd be much more on the decentralization</v>
<v Speaker 3>then centralization side.</v>

2841
02:04:11.770 --> 02:04:13.180
<v Speaker 2>So I know you haven't been here for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>

2842
02:04:13.210 --> 02:04:18.210
<v Speaker 2>but do you think that there's been any </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs that you maybe didn't expect like </v>

2843
02:04:18.210 --> 02:04:18.670
<v Speaker 2>that there's something going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still,</v>

2844
02:04:18.671 --> 02:04:23.671
<v Speaker 2>there's some still still some spark of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that maybe you won't have </v>

2845
02:04:23.671 --> 02:04:25.810
<v Speaker 2>access to enough or be around as much or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2846
02:04:26.130 --> 02:04:27.190
<v Speaker 2>You think there's any risk there?</v>

2847
02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:28.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2848
02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:32.160
<v Speaker 3>I think I'll have access to the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same sort of things,</v>

2849
02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:33.430
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2850
02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:37.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just getting a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outsider perspective.</v>

2851
02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:38.140
<v Speaker 3>Healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2852
02:04:38.610 --> 02:04:39.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2853
02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:40.890
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we,</v>

2854
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 3>when we initially set up my office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were in San Francisco,</v>

2855
02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:47.100
<v Speaker 3>which was a little bit outside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Silicon Valley for many years.</v>

2856
02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.860
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I always think you want to be,</v>

2857
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:51.430
<v Speaker 3>you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2858
02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:57.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to be not in the middle of the </v>

2859
02:04:57.250 --> 02:04:59.751
<v Speaker 3>insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be totally in the </v>

2860
02:04:59.751 --> 02:04:59.751
<v Speaker 3>boonies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be somewhere in between and a,</v>

2861
02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:04.800
<v Speaker 3>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think la is totally in the </v>

2862
02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:04.800
<v Speaker 3>boonies.</v>

2863
02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Well where I live by being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2864
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2865
02:05:06.471 --> 02:05:07.850
<v Speaker 2>So one more for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2866
02:05:07.851 --> 02:05:12.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been on this tour with Jordan </v>

2867
02:05:12.851 --> 02:05:12.851
<v Speaker 2>Peterson for the last couple of months </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2868
02:05:12.851 --> 02:05:17.241
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting because I go online </v>

2869
02:05:17.241 --> 02:05:19.451
<v Speaker 2>all day and there's people yelling at </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and seemingly hating each </v>

2870
02:05:19.451 --> 02:05:22.781
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I spend my nights with </v>

2871
02:05:22.781 --> 02:05:24.851
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people who are coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>together over ideas who may disagree on </v>

2872
02:05:24.851 --> 02:05:27.050
<v Speaker 2>this or that but really want to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>some answers.</v>

2873
02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:32.320
<v Speaker 2>So as someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the few people now that I think </v>

2874
02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:33.440
<v Speaker 2>is trying to find answers that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually making sense,</v>

2875
02:05:33.441 --> 02:05:38.441
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really wants to look at different </v>

2876
02:05:38.441 --> 02:05:40.721
<v Speaker 2>ways to solve the problems of the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the young people that are watching </v>

2877
02:05:40.721 --> 02:05:44.621
<v Speaker 2>this take anyone under 30 that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching this and wants to feel hopeful </v>

2878
02:05:44.621 --> 02:05:46.220
<v Speaker 2>because that's the other part that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is changing.</v>

2879
02:05:46.221 --> 02:05:49.940
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge amount of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't feel hopeful for the future.</v>

2880
02:05:50.150 --> 02:05:52.660
<v Speaker 2>They feel our political establishment is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just at,</v>

2881
02:05:52.661 --> 02:05:57.661
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at odds they feel this constant hate </v>

2882
02:05:57.661 --> 02:06:00.281
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For those people that want to feel </v>

2883
02:06:00.281 --> 02:06:00.281
<v Speaker 2>hopeful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

2884
02:06:00.281 --> 02:06:02.750
<v Speaker 2>what can you give them that they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>look to for a hopeful future?</v>

2885
02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:04.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2886
02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:06.850
<v Speaker 3>it's always hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always really hard to give,</v>

2887
02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:12.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always really hard to give generic </v>

2888
02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:13.500
<v Speaker 3>advice and I not going for generic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>always,</v>

2889
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:17.260
<v Speaker 3>I always feel so many things you can say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just sounds like bs in a way.</v>

2890
02:06:17.261 --> 02:06:21.740
<v Speaker 3>And that's sort of why this is actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>a simple but difficult question.</v>

2891
02:06:21.741 --> 02:06:24.370
<v Speaker 3>A very hard question away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2892
02:06:24.430 --> 02:06:25.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2893
02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:27.700
<v Speaker 3>the autobiographical part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2894
02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:32.760
<v Speaker 3>I tell about my history was that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was super tracked,</v>

2895
02:06:33.070 --> 02:06:38.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like eighth grade junior high </v>

2896
02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:38.070
<v Speaker 3>school yearbook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my friends says,</v>

2897
02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:42.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're gonna get into Stanford </v>

2898
02:06:42.511 --> 02:06:43.711
<v Speaker 3>and four years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years later you get into Stanford </v>

2899
02:06:43.711 --> 02:06:46.020
<v Speaker 3>to get into Stanford law school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ended up at a top tier law firm in </v>

2900
02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:47.270
<v Speaker 3>Manhattan and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2901
02:06:47.271 --> 02:06:52.271
<v Speaker 3>when these places on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wanted to get in on the </v>

2902
02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:52.600
<v Speaker 3>inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wanted to get out and um,</v>

2903
02:06:53.050 --> 02:06:56.590
<v Speaker 3>and the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a quarter life crisis.</v>

2904
02:06:56.620 --> 02:07:01.620
<v Speaker 3>I didn't never had a midlife crisis but </v>
<v Speaker 3>had maybe a quarter life crisis in my </v>

2905
02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:02.470
<v Speaker 3>mid twenties and the quarter life crisis</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

2906
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:03.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2907
02:07:04.150 --> 02:07:08.020
<v Speaker 3>why did I end up in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did I do?</v>

2908
02:07:08.021 --> 02:07:13.021
<v Speaker 3>And I think it was that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just followed the track and I wasn't </v>

2909
02:07:13.021 --> 02:07:14.200
<v Speaker 3>thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2910
02:07:14.530 --> 02:07:17.440
<v Speaker 3>why I was doing things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was doing.</v>

2911
02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:18.830
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2912
02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:20.950
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of,</v>

2913
02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:25.390
<v Speaker 3>that's the generic advice is that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tracks are not working.</v>

2914
02:07:26.410 --> 02:07:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they worked,</v>

2915
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.920
<v Speaker 3>they worked better in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had problems,</v>

2916
02:07:29.921 --> 02:07:32.230
<v Speaker 3>but they work better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They worked,</v>

2917
02:07:32.290 --> 02:07:37.290
<v Speaker 3>they stopped working for Gen x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're working even less for </v>

2918
02:07:37.290 --> 02:07:38.530
<v Speaker 3>millennials or Gen z who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever's next.</v>

2919
02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:39.700
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2920
02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2921
02:07:40.301 --> 02:07:43.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's more important than ever to,</v>

2922
02:07:43.241 --> 02:07:48.241
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think for yourself to find something </v>

2923
02:07:48.241 --> 02:07:48.241
<v Speaker 3>you're good at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're interested in,</v>

2924
02:07:48.241 --> 02:07:50.080
<v Speaker 3>you're motivated at and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do it.</v>

2925
02:07:50.410 --> 02:07:50.930
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2926
02:07:51.150 --> 02:07:51.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2927
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:52.840
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the generic,</v>

2928
02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:56.140
<v Speaker 3>the somewhat will actually cross the </v>
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>

2929
02:07:56.141 --> 02:07:59.310
<v Speaker 3>Advice I always have is not to be overly</v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive that the,</v>

2930
02:07:59.570 --> 02:08:01.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tracks forced you to compete,</v>

2931
02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:03.610
<v Speaker 3>you compete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you win,</v>

2932
02:08:03.940 --> 02:08:08.350
<v Speaker 3>you cycle and repeat and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you need to find something where,</v>

2933
02:08:08.530 --> 02:08:13.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not always just looking at the </v>

2934
02:08:13.530 --> 02:08:13.990
<v Speaker 3>people around you and you have some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some other reference point.</v>

2935
02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2936
02:08:15.530 --> 02:08:16.720
<v Speaker 3>this is sort of more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

2937
02:08:16.721 --> 02:08:18.460
<v Speaker 3>of a religious cut on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2938
02:08:18.461 --> 02:08:22.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always struck by how,</v>

2939
02:08:22.211 --> 02:08:23.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2940
02:08:23.681 --> 02:08:26.490
<v Speaker 3>the 10 commandments there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're sort of a,</v>

2941
02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:30.530
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of the first and last and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some or maybe the,</v>

2942
02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:32.470
<v Speaker 3>the important ones at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end,</v>

2943
02:08:32.530 --> 02:08:35.230
<v Speaker 3>and one's the first one is you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>only look to God.</v>

2944
02:08:35.370 --> 02:08:40.370
<v Speaker 3>There's only one God and worship him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the last one is you shouldn't </v>

2945
02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:42.610
<v Speaker 3>covet anything that belongs to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbor or,</v>

2946
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:43.720
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2947
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:46.990
<v Speaker 3>that you shouldn't look at the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>around you too much.</v>

2948
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:52.470
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we need to find some way to look </v>

2949
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.810
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to look,</v>

2950
02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:58.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to look around because when we look </v>

2951
02:08:58.170 --> 02:08:58.590
<v Speaker 3>around it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2952
02:08:58.670 --> 02:09:03.670
<v Speaker 3>it's not that we figured out what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do is just ends up being the </v>

2953
02:09:03.670 --> 02:09:06.040
<v Speaker 3>hyper copycat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the medic crazed environment.</v>

2954
02:09:06.190 --> 02:09:07.870
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's always,</v>

2955
02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:10.690
<v Speaker 3>there needs to be more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to find some transcendence.</v>

2956
02:09:10.691 --> 02:09:11.780
<v Speaker 3>I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what,</v>

2957
02:09:11.890 --> 02:09:16.890
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's powerful about the Peterson </v>

2958
02:09:16.890 --> 02:09:17.620
<v Speaker 3>message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that it can't just be fashion.</v>

2959
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:21.100
<v Speaker 3>It can't just be what everybody thinks </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's just a,</v>

2960
02:09:21.370 --> 02:09:26.370
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just going to be competing with </v>

2961
02:09:26.370 --> 02:09:26.370
<v Speaker 3>people like crazy.</v>

2962
02:09:26.370 --> 02:09:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a literal metaphor here and that</v>

2963
02:09:26.370 --> 02:09:29.780
<v Speaker 2>we're always looking down on our phones </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're telling us to look up.</v>

2964
02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>

2965
02:09:32.181 --> 02:09:33.170
<v Speaker 2>but we were always.</v>

2966
02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:37.170
<v Speaker 3>We're looking too much at the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>around us and we're,</v>

2967
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:37.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2968
02:09:37.881 --> 02:09:38.470
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2969
02:09:38.471 --> 02:09:39.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

2970
02:09:39.701 --> 02:09:44.701
<v Speaker 3>it can be efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be a shortcut and then at some </v>

2971
02:09:44.701 --> 02:09:46.050
<v Speaker 3>point it can just be a trap because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2972
02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:47.230
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the,</v>

2973
02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:52.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the business school example I often </v>

2974
02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:52.380
<v Speaker 3>give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you thinking of a business,</v>

2975
02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:56.340
<v Speaker 3>Harvard business school or any of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>business schools as hothouse </v>

2976
02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:56.340
<v Speaker 3>environments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you have a bunch of people,</v>

2977
02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:58.570
<v Speaker 3>they have no transcendent reference </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

2978
02:09:58.571 --> 02:09:59.290
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2979
02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:01.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have no idea what they want to do.</v>

2980
02:10:01.570 --> 02:10:06.570
<v Speaker 3>They're all sort of extroverted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll spend two years talking to each </v>

2981
02:10:06.570 --> 02:10:09.901
<v Speaker 3>other about what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any ideas and there's </v>

2982
02:10:09.901 --> 02:10:11.940
<v Speaker 3>almost a dynamic where you end up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2983
02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:17.240
<v Speaker 3>the most faddish that and the most wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea being the consensus choice for,</v>

2984
02:10:17.531 --> 02:10:18.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for so many of these people.</v>

2985
02:10:18.881 --> 02:10:21.910
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's always a dynamic to try to avoid.</v>

2986
02:10:22.210 --> 02:10:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2987
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to end an interview </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than that.</v>

2988
02:10:25.381 --> 02:10:30.381
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad that we finally got to do </v>

2989
02:10:30.381 --> 02:10:30.381
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2990
02:10:30.381 --> 02:10:30.381
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking before I sat down with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2991
02:10:30.381 --> 02:10:34.970
<v Speaker 2>where do I point people to with Peter </v>
<v Speaker 2>Teal and I can point them to your and </v>

2992
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:34.970
<v Speaker 2>everywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I thought,</v>

2993
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:39.970
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
