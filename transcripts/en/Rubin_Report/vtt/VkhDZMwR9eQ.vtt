00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today as a sex researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a neuroscientist and cohost of the wrong</v>

2
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.250
<v Speaker 1>speak podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Deborah.</v>

3
00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I am glad to have you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy to be here.</v>

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a lot to talk about.</v>

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>I thought the best way to start this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to look at my notes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>

9
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:23.924
<v Speaker 1>but you had a line on your patrion page </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I thought summed up the whole damn </v>

10
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:27.974
<v Speaker 1>thing pretty perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your patrion bio says creating </v>

11
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 1>journalism that defends science and free</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

12
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>You've come to the right show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

13
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we talk about sex first?</v>

15
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.283
<v Speaker 1>Should we just start with sex and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>can you talk about it all bleeds into </v>

16
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.883
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 1>you started as a neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were sort of more attracted,</v>

19
00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:55.040
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to studying sex.</v>

20
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about that.</v>

21
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

22
00:00:57.231 --> 00:00:58.064
<v Speaker 2>I decided to go back to school and do my</v>
<v Speaker 2>phd in neuroscience and along the way I </v>

23
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:03.050
<v Speaker 2>had the chance to do a placement in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexology.</v>

24
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 2>So I'd never heard of sex research </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

25
00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.164
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was so fascinating to me and I </v>

26
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:09.704
<v Speaker 2>thought it's crazy that we have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology to look at people's brains </v>

27
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:12.944
<v Speaker 2>and look at sexual arousal in the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it tells us so much about what it </v>

28
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 2>means to be human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from from there I was hooked.</v>

29
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:19.814
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Phd was in using brain imaging to </v>

30
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:24.104
<v Speaker 2>look at Paraphilias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are atypical sexual interest and </v>

31
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 2>hypersexuality and men and I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

32
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.424
<v Speaker 2>I always will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I made the decision to leave </v>

33
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:34.754
<v Speaker 2>academia and work full time as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist now because the climate had </v>

34
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:39.374
<v Speaker 2>changed so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even between when I started my phd and </v>

35
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:41.960
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I finished.</v>

36
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the stuff that you're </v>

37
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:44.534
<v Speaker 1>talking about really is at the nexus of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that I'm doing here because </v>

38
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:48.224
<v Speaker 1>now you're on the journalist side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's because of the hostility that </v>

39
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>you were facing on the academic side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we're.</v>

40
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.413
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you were unearthing are </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying that was so triggering to </v>

41
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:00.854
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

42
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.913
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within sexology you can't really study </v>

43
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 2>anything that isn't triggering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say across the board,</v>

44
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to get mad at you no </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what,</v>

45
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.563
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

46
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really looking at facts.</v>

47
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:12.950
<v Speaker 1>You're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking to find that.</v>

48
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

49
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 2>And even with brandon machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

50
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely,</v>

51
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:19.160
<v Speaker 2>it's a growing field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The technology is legitimate,</v>

52
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.310
<v Speaker 2>but no matter what I think because </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist still considered very taboo,</v>

53
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:23.144
<v Speaker 2>people will either project their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and beliefs and values onto it or </v>

54
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.060
<v Speaker 2>they just don't see the value and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

55
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 2>why is the government funding this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel really lucky being in Canada,</v>

56
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:34.430
<v Speaker 2>we do have a pretty amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.390
<v Speaker 2>scene in terms of sex research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

58
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.110
<v Speaker 2>and my colleagues do manage to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding.</v>

59
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:42.590
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my decision to leave academia,</v>

60
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.933
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the last two years I had noticed </v>

61
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:50.000
<v Speaker 2>things were starting to go a bit weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in terms of the climate and in terms</v>

62
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:50.834
<v Speaker 2>of mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was seeing piece after piece about </v>

63
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 2>transgender kids and how young children </v>
<v Speaker 2>were socially transitioning.</v>

64
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Getting on blockers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pubertal,</v>

65
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.473
<v Speaker 2>pubertal blockers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the media was basically saying this </v>

66
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 2>is the greatest thing.</v>

67
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 2>This is something that we should rejoice</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that these kids are so much better</v>

68
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 2>off after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from a scientific perspective,</v>

69
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.373
<v Speaker 2>the research actually shows that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of kids who are gender </v>

70
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 2>dysphoric actually outgrow their </v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings.</v>

71
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 2>They're more likely to grow up to be gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>in adulthood,</v>

72
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>not transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it makes sense for them to wait,</v>

73
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 2>not for them to socially transition at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>young age.</v>

74
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.323
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to write a mainstream piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this and there has been a very </v>

75
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 2>long standing history between trans </v>
<v Speaker 2>activist and a sex researchers.</v>

76
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Very ugly history of activists going </v>
<v Speaker 2>after sex researchers if they don't like</v>

77
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 2>what someone's study says or what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say publicly.</v>

78
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.573
<v Speaker 2>So I thought about it for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote the piece and I sat on it </v>

79
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 2>probably for about six months and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't sure if I wanted to put it out.</v>

80
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 2>I asked a bunch of my colleagues and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentors and they all said,</v>

81
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The science is solid,</v>

82
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what's going to happen.</v>

83
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 2>If you do put this out and at the time I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to stay in academia and I said,</v>

84
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 2>should I wait until I get tenure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone told me,</v>

85
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 2>even if you have tenured nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to protect you.</v>

86
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 2>You can still lose your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I decided to actually I couldn't stay</v>

87
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:08.854
<v Speaker 2>quiet and I thought I'm not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay in an environment where I can't </v>

88
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:12.124
<v Speaker 2>speak the truth and I can't even pursue </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions that are meaningful anymore </v>

89
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:15.604
<v Speaker 2>because I have to worry about who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get mad and then I'm going to </v>

90
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 2>lose my money and my funding and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to lose my job.</v>

91
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:21.214
<v Speaker 2>So that piece went out and it was called</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white transgender kids show a </v>

92
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 2>transition and then I haven't looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>back since.</v>

93
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I re-read.</v>

94
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I've read the piece before but I reread </v>
<v Speaker 1>it this morning,</v>

95
00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:32.250
<v Speaker 1>but thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got here.</v>

96
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.503
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much of this is just bleed is </v>

97
00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>just blatantly a misunderstanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

98
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.693
<v Speaker 1>Like I think there's partly that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a misunderstanding of science and </v>

99
00:04:45.211 --> 00:04:48.150
<v Speaker 1>then you just have activists who just </v>
<v Speaker 1>want you to bow to them all the time.</v>

100
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Are you able to sort of quantify how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of the backlash is each?</v>

101
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.790
<v Speaker 2>I think to be charitable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to look at the other side and give</v>

102
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:00.480
<v Speaker 2>them credit and try to think that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have good intentions.</v>

103
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Maybe people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

104
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:06.330
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All 11 studies ever done on the topic of</v>

105
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.173
<v Speaker 2>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this phenomenon I talked about where </v>

106
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.460
<v Speaker 2>kids grow out of their feelings of </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender dysphoria,</v>

107
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.360
<v Speaker 2>all of them say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the final statistic is about 60 to 90</v>

108
00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the vast majority of kids.</v>

109
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.840
<v Speaker 2>You can't really question those data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think what it could be as people,</v>

110
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:24.684
<v Speaker 2>I mean trans people have a history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to deal with medical gatekeeping </v>

111
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:30.870
<v Speaker 2>of people telling them they don't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they feel isn't real.</v>

112
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.590
<v Speaker 2>I do think gender dysphoria is a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon and I do think we should have</v>

113
00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:36.800
<v Speaker 2>empathy for people who are suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

114
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>so I think it could be coming from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

115
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.900
<v Speaker 2>of that place of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

116
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.123
<v Speaker 2>we don't want people saying that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a legitimate thing or that trans </v>

117
00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:45.930
<v Speaker 2>people should be forced to not feel the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they do,</v>

118
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.800
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of these children,</v>

119
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.293
<v Speaker 2>we should be thinking about the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome so it doesn't make sense for </v>

120
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:54.324
<v Speaker 2>them to transition if that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually going to help them in the </v>

121
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.480
<v Speaker 2>longterm.</v>

122
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.313
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I to give people the benefit of the </v>

123
00:05:58.311 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 2>doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think the activists,</v>

124
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some level,</v>

125
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 2>I think they know that they can bully </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex researchers because of that history.</v>

126
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:11.230
<v Speaker 2>They know that there's only so much an </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic can do and they've won a couple</v>

127
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 2>battles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's part of it as well.</v>

128
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>How shocking was it to you when you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing this with colleagues,</v>

129
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.193
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were kind of hinting you may </v>

130
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>want to wait on this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

131
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>did you think that you'd be in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation?</v>

132
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering,</v>

133
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>did any of them sit on some other things</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were afraid to.</v>

134
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.510
<v Speaker 2>It was eyeopening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

136
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:37.360
<v Speaker 2>I kind of knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

137
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.100
<v Speaker 2>one one I guess instance I can talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about is one colleague,</v>

138
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Michael Bailey at northwestern </v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

139
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.303
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a book that upset transgender </v>
<v Speaker 2>activists and they went off after </v>

140
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.553
<v Speaker 2>ruthlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they really tried to destroy his </v>

141
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:52.170
<v Speaker 2>life and thankfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:06:52.171 --> 00:06:53.004
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still considered one of the </v>

143
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.720
<v Speaker 2>foremost experts in sexology </v>
<v Speaker 2>internationally.</v>

144
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.370
<v Speaker 2>But I would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:00.204
<v Speaker 2>I've written about him previously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's kind of been the poster </v>

146
00:07:03.571 --> 00:07:04.404
<v Speaker 2>boys to why people are really terrified </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say anything that goes against the </v>

147
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Trans Narrative.</v>

148
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.230
<v Speaker 1>So I think you've already hinted at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know your work otherwise,</v>

149
00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:14.920
<v Speaker 1>but so you have no issue with trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>people as people.</v>

150
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Just to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is purely about the science related</v>

151
00:07:18.641 --> 00:07:19.474
<v Speaker 1>to transitioning and hormone blockers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things of that nature of a certain </v>

152
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:25.560
<v Speaker 1>age where they're doing it as young as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're right about 14.</v>

153
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>younger than that now.</v>

154
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.813
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

155
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean if there's parental consent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

156
00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:31.690
<v Speaker 2>And I have to say for a transgender </v>
<v Speaker 2>adults,</v>

157
00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:34.030
<v Speaker 2>and I'd say even kids who reached </v>
<v Speaker 2>puberty and still feel that way,</v>

158
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I think transitioning is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is totally up to you.</v>

159
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:39.700
<v Speaker 2>If that's the path you decide to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then power to you.</v>

160
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

161
00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:44.200
<v Speaker 2>it's anyone's business to tell you what </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do at that point.</v>

162
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>So why are there basic parameters </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to age then?</v>

163
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are insurance.</v>

164
00:07:49.871 --> 00:07:52.780
<v Speaker 2>So I don't work with children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do clinical work anymore.</v>

165
00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:55.780
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the research literature,</v>

166
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.973
<v Speaker 2>usually clinicians will wait until </v>
<v Speaker 2>puberty and see how the child feels at </v>

167
00:08:01.271 --> 00:08:02.950
<v Speaker 2>that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the body starts changing,</v>

168
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.950
<v Speaker 2>when they start having crushes on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>peers and that kind of thing.</v>

169
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.110
<v Speaker 2>And the research does show that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

170
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.660
<v Speaker 2>when kids start to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:10.563
<v Speaker 2>have crushes and start dating and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can play a role in terms of how they </v>

172
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:17.230
<v Speaker 2>feel about their bodies and whether they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do outgrow it.</v>

173
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Just at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole body is in flux.</v>

174
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Your mental states and physical states </v>
<v Speaker 1>in flux.</v>

175
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.441
<v Speaker 1>And as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

176
00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:26.274
<v Speaker 1>what did you say a percentage on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of How many of them turn out to just so </v>

177
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>

178
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>so 60 to 90 percent of the children </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergoing these feelings turn out to be</v>

179
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 1>gay and then I assume the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't transition,</v>

180
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 1>probably most of them ended up being </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay with being gay,</v>

181
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly.</v>

182
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:43.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say even like I grew up in </v>

183
00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:46.554
<v Speaker 2>the gay community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of gay male friends and </v>

184
00:08:47.911 --> 00:08:51.300
<v Speaker 2>they've said to me when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told my parents all the time,</v>

185
00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:52.134
<v Speaker 2>I hated being a boy and I want it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a girl and I am a girl and why can I </v>

186
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 2>become a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now as a gay man,</v>

187
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm so comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy.</v>

188
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 2>And they say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:01.194
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of glad I'm not growing up in </v>

190
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 2>this time because I think I probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have transitioned.</v>

191
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why the,</v>

192
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:06.264
<v Speaker 1>the external pressure seemed so crazy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me because you just don't know at that </v>

193
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.820
<v Speaker 1>at that age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you do know waiting a little</v>

194
00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a,</v>

195
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.830
<v Speaker 1>for the science to flesh out here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to kill you.</v>

196
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 1>It's just hard talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>evening.</v>

197
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

198
00:09:21.771 --> 00:09:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>

199
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.400
<v Speaker 2>what people also aren't talking about is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that for these kids,</v>

200
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.970
<v Speaker 2>in some cases the parents don't want a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay child and this is what upsets me the</v>

201
00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:29.804
<v Speaker 2>most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a little boy who's very </v>

202
00:09:31.401 --> 00:09:34.160
<v Speaker 2>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's likely going to grow up to be a gay</v>

203
00:09:34.161 --> 00:09:34.994
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you take that same level and </v>

204
00:09:37.191 --> 00:09:39.800
<v Speaker 2>allow them to transition to female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he grows up,</v>

205
00:09:39.801 --> 00:09:41.210
<v Speaker 2>he's going to appear to be a straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

206
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.553
<v Speaker 2>And so these parents are being lauded as</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive when really they're </v>

207
00:09:45.321 --> 00:09:46.154
<v Speaker 2>homophobic.</v>

208
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How perverse that is.</v>

209
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:48.993
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting what you just said </v>

210
00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:52.460
<v Speaker 1>about a certain amount of gay men that </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow up,</v>

211
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to be a or it felt more like</v>

212
00:09:54.951 --> 00:09:56.480
<v Speaker 1>a girl or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then eventually grew out and we were</v>

213
00:09:56.481 --> 00:09:57.314
<v Speaker 1>okay because I never felt that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I played sports and I played video </v>

214
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:02.660
<v Speaker 1>games and transformers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

215
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.553
<v Speaker 1>all the things that my friends did or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>never felt like I was a girl or more </v>

216
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.370
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always say to me,</v>

217
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't seem gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm always like,</v>

218
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:14.420
<v Speaker 1>it ain't like I'm married to a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty gay,</v>

220
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.280
<v Speaker 1>but I never had that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

221
00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:20.150
<v Speaker 1>that sort of just interesting about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology of gay people in general.</v>

222
00:10:20.151 --> 00:10:20.984
<v Speaker 1>There are gay people that grow up </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling very feminine or gay men that </v>

223
00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:24.674
<v Speaker 1>grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not feeling that way and I'm sure </v>

224
00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:29.480
<v Speaker 1>there's women that grow up feeling very </v>
<v Speaker 1>butch or whatever.</v>

225
00:10:29.481 --> 00:10:31.820
<v Speaker 1>And there's women that grew up that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

226
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.340
<v Speaker 1>lipstick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesbians and the whole thing.</v>

227
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Have you done any research on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on any of that?</v>

228
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of my research,</v>

229
00:10:38.051 --> 00:10:38.884
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in terms of what studies have shown </v>

230
00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:43.120
<v Speaker 2>it as about hormone levels in utero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So testosterone,</v>

231
00:10:43.121 --> 00:10:45.670
<v Speaker 2>if you are exposed to higher levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone in Utero,</v>

232
00:10:45.671 --> 00:10:48.700
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to be male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>typical and masculine when you're born.</v>

233
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:49.743
<v Speaker 2>So whether you're male or female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most boys are exposed to high levels </v>

234
00:10:52.811 --> 00:10:55.150
<v Speaker 2>of testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at that explains when they're born,</v>

235
00:10:55.151 --> 00:10:59.350
<v Speaker 2>why they are interested in Male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>typical toys and activities.</v>

236
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for gay men they were likely exposed </v>

237
00:11:03.311 --> 00:11:06.460
<v Speaker 2>to lower levels of testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why they're more feminine.</v>

238
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.780
<v Speaker 2>And the same with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with girls,</v>

239
00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:08.614
<v Speaker 2>if they're exposed to higher levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone than more likely to be </v>

240
00:11:10.511 --> 00:11:11.500
<v Speaker 2>masculine and lesbian.</v>

241
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's obvious outliers.</v>

242
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is on average.</v>

243
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.430
<v Speaker 1>On average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

244
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.583
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a danger in talking about that </v>

245
00:11:18.951 --> 00:11:19.784
<v Speaker 1>because I would imagine that the certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people in the gay community </v>

246
00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:23.174
<v Speaker 1>that would want you to never go down </v>
<v Speaker 1>that road because then you could end up </v>

247
00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:27.801
<v Speaker 1>in a place where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

248
00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:28.634
<v Speaker 1>we would be able to prevent people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a ultimately if we can really </v>

249
00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:34.430
<v Speaker 1>figure out the science behind all this.</v>

250
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.461
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

251
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:37.120
<v Speaker 2>as a straight woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say I even,</v>

252
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I even right now feel like maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be saying these things because</v>

253
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak for the community.</v>

254
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.270
<v Speaker 2>But as a former sex researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am very much a proponent of A.</v>

255
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:47.723
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather you speak as a researcher </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a gay person or a straight person </v>

256
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>or anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>

257
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.790
<v Speaker 1>this is the problem though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

258
00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:54.180
<v Speaker 1>you're know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you weren't,</v>

259
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.023
<v Speaker 1>you were an expert in this and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>even for you who's so brave on all of </v>

260
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 1>these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets weird to talk about it.</v>

261
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:03.690
<v Speaker 1>And even for me I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a little weird to talk</v>

262
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.980
<v Speaker 2>like a trader.</v>

263
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am what I am and that's all that I am.</v>

264
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.043
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like I know that just even talking </v>

265
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.610
<v Speaker 1>about this just gets people crazy and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what our,</v>

266
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.940
<v Speaker 1>what our twitter feeds are going to look</v>

267
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.630
<v Speaker 2>right after this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get ready.</v>

268
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.733
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's crazy because even my </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleagues who have the best intentions </v>

269
00:12:23.931 --> 00:12:24.764
<v Speaker 2>are doing this research because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just want understand why are people the </v>

270
00:12:27.141 --> 00:12:28.700
<v Speaker 2>way they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

271
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.270
<v Speaker 2>There are no nefarious intentions there </v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are so quick to jump on.</v>

272
00:12:32.271 --> 00:12:36.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was earlier this year there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a study about using ai to be able to</v>

273
00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:39.440
<v Speaker 2>detect whether someone is gay by looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at their face.</v>

274
00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.453
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies have shown that on average you </v>

275
00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:45.530
<v Speaker 2>can see differences between straight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people.</v>

276
00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:46.364
<v Speaker 2>Both men and women in terms of facial </v>
<v Speaker 2>features and so everyone's freaking out </v>

277
00:12:49.521 --> 00:12:50.354
<v Speaker 2>about this study and I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't we saying this is amazing </v>

278
00:12:53.391 --> 00:12:55.700
<v Speaker 2>that we're able to know this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

279
00:12:55.701 --> 00:12:56.534
<v Speaker 2>I think I've really good Gaydar I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>always thought I have and now I think </v>

280
00:12:58.531 --> 00:12:59.364
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's actually some quantitative </v>

281
00:13:00.621 --> 00:13:03.410
<v Speaker 2>data to suggest that I'm not just making</v>
<v Speaker 2>things up.</v>

282
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're also,</v>

283
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 1>they always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well gay guys have Gaydar something else</v>

284
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:10.060
<v Speaker 1>that maybe you can see or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

285
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Or they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the people say it anymore,</v>

286
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:12.694
<v Speaker 1>but people used to say gay face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's just something about the </v>

287
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:15.334
<v Speaker 1>facial features sometimes of gay men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they were a little softer or </v>

288
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.990
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what it is,</v>

289
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>but like people were talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the gay community.</v>

290
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Then it comes out through some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science lens and it's like,</v>

291
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we better watch out for that.</v>

292
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.000
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is then researchers see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and say,</v>

293
00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:30.834
<v Speaker 2>well I don't want to go through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they don't want to touch that </v>

294
00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:33.090
<v Speaker 2>topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now there's,</v>

295
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.953
<v Speaker 2>they're eventually going to be only like</v>
<v Speaker 2>two different things you could probably </v>

296
00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:37.770
<v Speaker 2>study unless you know that what your </v>
<v Speaker 2>findings,</v>

297
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.680
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to find is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically acceptable,</v>

298
00:13:40.681 --> 00:13:41.514
<v Speaker 2>in which case you shouldn't be doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>research because that means you're not </v>

299
00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:43.974
<v Speaker 2>actually doing science.</v>

300
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:44.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it is about you that </v>

301
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.070
<v Speaker 1>makes you brave enough to do this sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing?</v>

302
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Because I bet a couple of other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about James Debord a</v>

303
00:13:51.441 --> 00:13:52.274
<v Speaker 1>little bit because you've also written </v>
<v Speaker 1>about him and why the whole thing about </v>

304
00:13:55.431 --> 00:13:56.264
<v Speaker 1>diversity and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've had a bunch of outliers in </v>

305
00:13:58.401 --> 00:13:59.234
<v Speaker 1>these communities on the show and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>always curious what it is about the </v>

306
00:14:01.881 --> 00:14:05.510
<v Speaker 1>specific people that make them sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it out there and go,</v>

307
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you like it or not.</v>

308
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.600
<v Speaker 2>It's probably my personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

309
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:11.434
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just generally don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>care what people think about me and I'm </v>

310
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:18.610
<v Speaker 2>pretty stubborn and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very.</v>

311
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:23.420
<v Speaker 2>I feel very strongly about sex research </v>
<v Speaker 2>being taken seriously and my decision to</v>

312
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.273
<v Speaker 2>go on it and gone into that field that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you deal with a lot of stigma as I </v>

313
00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:28.420
<v Speaker 2>mentioned earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You deal with it on both sides,</v>

314
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:29.254
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you make the decision to go </v>

315
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 2>into the field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly when people know what you do,</v>

316
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:37.000
<v Speaker 2>they will judge you on a personal level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that was part of it.</v>

317
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:37.893
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up very thick skin from saying </v>

318
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do what I find interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people can assume whatever they want</v>

319
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:46.630
<v Speaker 2>about me and that I think that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>translated into now what I do as a,</v>

320
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:48.380
<v Speaker 2>as a science journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

321
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I would say too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure you probably went through a</v>

322
00:14:50.561 --> 00:14:51.394
<v Speaker 2>similar experience once you speak out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes much easier and I find I </v>

323
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't stay quiet now.</v>

324
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.950
<v Speaker 2>And I find the people that are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 2>turn their backs on you let them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need them in your life.</v>

326
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you start,</v>

327
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 1>you can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

328
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 1>it's built into you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't stop.</v>

329
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I think is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting is how,</v>

330
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such a movement always to say </v>

331
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:15.800
<v Speaker 1>that gay people are born this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

332
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:16.634
<v Speaker 1>Lady Gaga even wrote it down on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathroom floor in this way and yet at </v>

333
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:24.260
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I know for a fact,</v>

334
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:28.410
<v Speaker 1>like I have a friend who for many years </v>
<v Speaker 1>was my lesbian friend,</v>

335
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.900
<v Speaker 1>my one good lesbian friend and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>dating girls all the time and all that.</v>

336
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.183
<v Speaker 1>Then about three years ago we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there and she told me that she </v>

337
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:38.024
<v Speaker 1>met a guy and now she's been with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy for about three or four years and </v>

338
00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 1>they're getting married and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified as basically as bisexual now,</v>

339
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:47.264
<v Speaker 1>but she's only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's exclusively been with a guy for </v>

340
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:49.994
<v Speaker 1>about four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I find interesting about it is </v>

341
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:52.994
<v Speaker 1>that her lesbian friends have basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>all turned on her and this is supposed </v>

342
00:15:59.121 --> 00:15:59.954
<v Speaker 1>to be the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are supposed to be the people of </v>

343
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 1>tolerance and we should accept your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and all that.</v>

344
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 1>But when it goes the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly it becomes this other thing.</v>

345
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Have you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seen that before?</v>

346
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine that I'm.</v>

347
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing they probably think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she sold out.</v>

348
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.700
<v Speaker 2>She's a sellout or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

349
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.150
<v Speaker 1>you're taking the easy road or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

350
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Like every insane cliche and I know her </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be completely authentic and real.</v>

351
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.720
<v Speaker 2>How does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how has she dealt with it?</v>

352
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:24.554
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious.</v>

353
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.590
<v Speaker 1>It's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

354
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.540
<v Speaker 1>it's woken her up in a zillion other </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

355
00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:28.374
<v Speaker 1>so for a lot of the other things that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about about free speech and </v>

356
00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:36.030
<v Speaker 1>politics and freedom and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's started to wake up to all of that.</v>

357
00:16:36.031 --> 00:16:36.864
<v Speaker 1>She was a huge lefty progressive and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's basically a libertarian because </v>

358
00:16:41.611 --> 00:16:45.180
<v Speaker 1>she saw that authoritarian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you guys want to control me?</v>

359
00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.510
<v Speaker 1>The second I think differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys want to control me,</v>

360
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.630
<v Speaker 1>so now she's like the</v>

361
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.790
<v Speaker 2>good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of my friends so to speak.</v>

362
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.163
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all of us are eventually going </v>

363
00:16:54.211 --> 00:16:55.044
<v Speaker 2>to have a moment like that where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize what you thought was the truth </v>

364
00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:01.870
<v Speaker 2>is not the truth and there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>

365
00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:02.704
<v Speaker 2>It's like falling down that rabbit hole </v>
<v Speaker 2>and real and you start to question </v>

366
00:17:04.271 --> 00:17:06.370
<v Speaker 2>everything then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's really liberating.</v>

367
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.391
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:08.620
<v Speaker 2>in terms of sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

369
00:17:08.621 --> 00:17:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women,</v>

370
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.150
<v Speaker 2>female sexuality is much more fluid than</v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

371
00:17:13.151 --> 00:17:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Some men tend to be very category </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific.</v>

372
00:17:15.161 --> 00:17:17.440
<v Speaker 2>If you're into women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really like women.</v>

373
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 2>You're not two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're into guys,</v>

374
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:23.080
<v Speaker 2>do you guys not to women than women tend</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a little bit more flexible.</v>

375
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like you find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:25.683
<v Speaker 1>there are supposedly straight married </v>
<v Speaker 1>men that on the dl or sleeping with </v>

377
00:17:28.801 --> 00:17:29.634
<v Speaker 1>other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure there aren't many </v>

378
00:17:30.601 --> 00:17:31.434
<v Speaker 1>gay men that are in relationships are </v>
<v Speaker 1>married that are sneaking out and </v>

379
00:17:34.021 --> 00:17:34.854
<v Speaker 1>sleeping with women.</v>

380
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.350
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen one of those who?</v>

381
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Your research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

382
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

383
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I think the first case I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably closet gays and then the second</v>

384
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:49.260
<v Speaker 2>case I have to think about that</v>

385
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.243
<v Speaker 1>gay man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

386
00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I guess you might be sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

387
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:55.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean I did it like I slept with women </v>
<v Speaker 1>as sort of like a,</v>

388
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.320
<v Speaker 1>an overcompensation or I was trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even overcompensation.</v>

389
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I was really trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought I should try.</v>

390
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I and tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried and you know,</v>

391
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 1>eventually I tried no more.</v>

392
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also for gay men when you come </v>

393
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:10.674
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a big thing and I think to </v>

394
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:18.081
<v Speaker 2>make that decision to come out is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>committed to this as much as you know,</v>

395
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.680
<v Speaker 2>we don't like identity labels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is an identity label.</v>

396
00:18:20.681 --> 00:18:21.514
<v Speaker 2>So I would see it as being less common </v>
<v Speaker 2>for someone who's gay to be sleeping </v>

397
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:29.541
<v Speaker 2>with women on the side because he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have likely just stayed in that camp.</v>

398
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 2>That would be my guess.</v>

399
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

400
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned that you,</v>

401
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.990
<v Speaker 1>you study a lot of this related to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

402
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.123
<v Speaker 1>how a lot of this is sort of built into </v>
<v Speaker 1>us and you studied this across sort of </v>

403
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.680
<v Speaker 1>fetishize the right word.</v>

404
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.020
<v Speaker 2>A paraphilia is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

405
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.090
<v Speaker 2>fetishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a specific pair of failure,</v>

406
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.180
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the board basically.</v>

407
00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 1>So wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the definition of Paraphilia,</v>

408
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.993
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unusual sexual interests and how's that </v>

409
00:18:54.141 --> 00:18:55.640
<v Speaker 2>different than fetish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

410
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.483
<v Speaker 2>if fetishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a specific object or body part that you </v>

411
00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.590
<v Speaker 2>have a preference for.</v>

412
00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

413
00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.853
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about a couple of those </v>

414
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.460
<v Speaker 1>located.</v>

415
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.650
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I always,</v>

416
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.300
<v Speaker 2>I tell people this and no one ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes me,</v>

417
00:19:08.301 --> 00:19:12.140
<v Speaker 2>but I'm actually very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very traditional vanilla,</v>

418
00:19:12.141 --> 00:19:12.980
<v Speaker 2>not kinky.</v>

419
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.663
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to ask you all that at the </v>

420
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.313
<v Speaker 1>end about yourself.</v>

421
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

422
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

423
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.173
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super fascinating and I guess it's </v>

424
00:19:20.991 --> 00:19:22.820
<v Speaker 2>my way of living vicariously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

425
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.983
<v Speaker 2>so in terms of different paraphilia is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a foyer ism is known as </v>

426
00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:29.474
<v Speaker 2>peeping toms and exhibitionism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people like to expose themselves a </v>

427
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.950
<v Speaker 2>sadism and masochism which are different</v>
<v Speaker 2>from bdsm.</v>

428
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Bdsm is consensual masochism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadism.</v>

429
00:19:40.311 --> 00:19:42.230
<v Speaker 2>So masochism being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting,</v>

430
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.510
<v Speaker 2>wanting to be humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sadism is one,</v>

431
00:19:44.511 --> 00:19:45.860
<v Speaker 2>just your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be humiliated.</v>

432
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.873
<v Speaker 2>Bdsm is very much about consent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not true masochism or sadism </v>

433
00:19:49.401 --> 00:19:50.234
<v Speaker 2>because a partners will negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand and not do anything outside </v>

434
00:19:53.331 --> 00:19:55.760
<v Speaker 2>of particular boundaries and that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>

435
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else is there?</v>

436
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:58.783
<v Speaker 2>Fraud or ISM.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's when people like to rub up </v>

437
00:20:00.321 --> 00:20:03.560
<v Speaker 2>against unsuspecting people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are tons I could go on forever.</v>

438
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how are these all connected to </v>

439
00:20:06.411 --> 00:20:07.244
<v Speaker 1>the same parts of the brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the same mechanism that's working </v>

440
00:20:10.581 --> 00:20:13.210
<v Speaker 1>in the fetish itself is just manifested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in</v>

441
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.760
<v Speaker 2>different targets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

442
00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:17.580
<v Speaker 2>So with my research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was still a researcher,</v>

443
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I found that for men who are Kinky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they look at kinky pornography,</v>

444
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:22.584
<v Speaker 2>the same brain network activates as when</v>
<v Speaker 2>non kinky people are looking at regular </v>

445
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.593
<v Speaker 2>or vanilla pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's adjust that paraphilias maybe </v>

446
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.033
<v Speaker 2>akin to a sexual orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not to say that's the same as </v>

447
00:20:33.811 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 2>being gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the same idea conceptually that</v>

448
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:38.850
<v Speaker 2>it's someone's preference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be changed.</v>

449
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's with them from,</v>

450
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.760
<v Speaker 2>from very early on.</v>

451
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does the Internet play into all </v>

452
00:20:44.171 --> 00:20:45.004
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know you've written about a </v>

453
00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:47.403
<v Speaker 1>porn and things like that where now all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff is so accessible where </v>

454
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:56.280
<v Speaker 1>obviously even 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago it was a lot harder to get.</v>

455
00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are probably able to test</v>

456
00:21:00.591 --> 00:21:03.590
<v Speaker 2>out different things and go searching </v>
<v Speaker 2>for things out of curiosity.</v>

457
00:21:03.591 --> 00:21:04.424
<v Speaker 2>But if you really like something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's because you happened </v>

458
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:09.650
<v Speaker 2>to find it on the Internet and with porn</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction in particular,</v>

459
00:21:09.651 --> 00:21:14.330
<v Speaker 2>there's no research to suggest that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real thing that excessive porn viewing</v>

460
00:21:14.331 --> 00:21:15.164
<v Speaker 2>is akin to an addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually if you talk to someone with </v>

461
00:21:17.751 --> 00:21:20.120
<v Speaker 2>problems with porn across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

462
00:21:20.121 --> 00:21:22.370
<v Speaker 2>there's always some other reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>either they're anxious,</v>

463
00:21:22.371 --> 00:21:23.600
<v Speaker 2>they like to procrastinate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

464
00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:24.434
<v Speaker 2>they don't like to procrastinate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they use it as a way of </v>

465
00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:27.410
<v Speaker 2>procrastinating and avoiding other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

466
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not that they're actually addicted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pornography.</v>

467
00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear though that people will</v>

468
00:21:31.881 --> 00:21:32.271
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

469
00:21:32.271 --> 00:21:33.104
<v Speaker 1>you're getting that dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that partly what being addicted </v>

470
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.700
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you become addicted to that?</v>

471
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:38.973
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My understanding of the term addiction </v>

472
00:21:40.281 --> 00:21:41.360
<v Speaker 1>slightly incorrectly.</v>

473
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.660
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

474
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.650
<v Speaker 2>but dopamine is released during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of different things.</v>

475
00:21:45.651 --> 00:21:48.750
<v Speaker 2>If you eat a nice piece of food that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dopamine's released,</v>

476
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see a nice picture,</v>

477
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.070
<v Speaker 2>dope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean reward,</v>

478
00:21:52.071 --> 00:21:54.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's responsible for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

479
00:21:54.201 --> 00:21:56.930
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's one case of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

480
00:21:56.931 --> 00:21:57.764
<v Speaker 2>I do have some issue with science </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists watering things down and </v>

481
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:04.490
<v Speaker 2>liking to take one finding or one study </v>
<v Speaker 2>in kind of a,</v>

482
00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>representing it or misrepresenting it.</v>

483
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:11.060
<v Speaker 2>So it's not really an accurate take on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

484
00:22:11.061 --> 00:22:11.894
<v Speaker 2>but I understand why people think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because dopamine has been seen as the </v>

485
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.940
<v Speaker 2>addiction neurotransmitter and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see so much about porn,</v>

486
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.701
<v Speaker 2>porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>

487
00:22:19.701 --> 00:22:20.534
<v Speaker 2>sex addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say probably a year ago it was </v>

488
00:22:21.981 --> 00:22:22.814
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was talking about porn and sex </v>

489
00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:24.980
<v Speaker 2>addiction even though they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

490
00:22:24.981 --> 00:22:28.490
<v Speaker 2>there's no legitimate research to </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggest that those things are real.</v>

491
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.693
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you've studied all of these </v>

492
00:22:31.331 --> 00:22:32.060
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

493
00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:32.893
<v Speaker 1>what are you finding out about the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a neuroscientist and can anything be </v>

494
00:22:36.581 --> 00:22:37.414
<v Speaker 1>done for any of these things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody was partaking in these </v>

495
00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:40.594
<v Speaker 1>things and either didn't want to or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least wanting to understand it or </v>

496
00:22:43.121 --> 00:22:43.954
<v Speaker 1>whatever else.</v>

497
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:48.420
<v Speaker 2>The biggest thing I would say is find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner who accepts you for who you are.</v>

498
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially for men,</v>

499
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.353
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the difference between someone </v>

500
00:22:54.121 --> 00:22:54.360
<v Speaker 2>who has</v>

501
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.193
<v Speaker 1>so meaning women's kinks or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>will change with time where a man would </v>

502
00:22:58.081 --> 00:22:58.914
<v Speaker 1>be less inclined to.</v>

503
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same with,</v>

504
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:01.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same way with the sexual </v>

505
00:23:01.501 --> 00:23:02.334
<v Speaker 2>orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women tend to be more flexible with </v>

506
00:23:03.151 --> 00:23:04.920
<v Speaker 2>their sexual preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if are Kinky,</v>

507
00:23:04.921 --> 00:23:05.754
<v Speaker 2>they might be really kinky with one </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner or if they have a partner who's </v>

508
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.870
<v Speaker 2>very kinky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be into whatever he's into if</v>

509
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:10.723
<v Speaker 2>it's a straight couple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then if she's with someone who's </v>

510
00:23:12.411 --> 00:23:14.760
<v Speaker 2>less Kinky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not be as much of a problem.</v>

511
00:23:14.761 --> 00:23:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if it's a man who's really into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

512
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.650
<v Speaker 2>if his partner is not into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's always going to be into it.</v>

513
00:23:19.651 --> 00:23:20.790
<v Speaker 2>He's just going to have to hide it.</v>

514
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of this phrase,</v>

515
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:24.550
<v Speaker 1>lesbian bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

516
00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:25.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all over the place.</v>

517
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going into the fall and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with.</v>

518
00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard this phrase before?</v>

519
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 2>It's means that there's no sex after a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of time.</v>

520
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That lesbians,</v>

521
00:23:35.841 --> 00:23:40.841
<v Speaker 1>it sort of burns very hot for that early</v>
<v Speaker 1>period and then the u haul shows up as a</v>

522
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:46.460
<v Speaker 1>joke and then just like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desire for sex just disappeared.</v>

523
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 2>There's just lots of cuddling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard of that.</v>

524
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:50.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men on average do tend to have a higher </v>

525
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:52.904
<v Speaker 2>sex drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I could see if you're in a </v>

526
00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:55.890
<v Speaker 2>relationship where it's two women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how uh,</v>

527
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:56.803
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

528
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 2>their sex drive might be a bit lower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not sure what else?</v>

529
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you really thinking about right</v>

530
00:24:04.951 --> 00:24:05.784
<v Speaker 1>now in general?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the topics that are really on </v>

531
00:24:08.011 --> 00:24:09.090
<v Speaker 1>your mind related to all this?</v>

532
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.280
<v Speaker 2>My concern number one is probably seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>how gender is being warped to facilitate</v>

533
00:24:16.781 --> 00:24:19.120
<v Speaker 2>particular political agendas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

534
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:19.983
<v Speaker 2>as you mentioned the James Damore and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing how that whole thing unfolded </v>

535
00:24:22.691 --> 00:24:23.560
<v Speaker 2>last summer.</v>

536
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about that.</v>

537
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Could you wrote a piece on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the piece coming out.</v>

538
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:28.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

539
00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:31.350
<v Speaker 2>so I remember when that news first </v>
<v Speaker 2>broke,</v>

540
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:32.563
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this sexist memo was going around </v>

541
00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.330
<v Speaker 2>and I read it and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

542
00:24:36.331 --> 00:24:39.000
<v Speaker 2>this is not sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I saw the statement from Google</v>

543
00:24:39.001 --> 00:24:42.660
<v Speaker 2>that he was perpetuating gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotypes and I thought,</v>

544
00:24:42.661 --> 00:24:45.480
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I wrote that column for the Globe</v>

545
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.920
<v Speaker 2>and Mail to speak to the science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

546
00:24:46.921 --> 00:24:47.754
<v Speaker 2>you know what the science said James </v>
<v Speaker 2>cited was absolutely 100 percent </v>

547
00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.330
<v Speaker 2>legitimate and there shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything wrong with saying that.</v>

548
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.210
<v Speaker 2>And if you actually read his memo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that he's not a misogynist.</v>

549
00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.073
<v Speaker 2>And we actually saw the podcasts that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>cohost with Jonathan Kay called wrong </v>

550
00:25:00.751 --> 00:25:01.584
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually interviewed him for our </v>

551
00:25:02.821 --> 00:25:05.220
<v Speaker 2>first episode and if you listened to him</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak,</v>

552
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:06.090
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see,</v>

553
00:25:06.091 --> 00:25:06.924
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very much for equality between the </v>

554
00:25:08.431 --> 00:25:11.070
<v Speaker 2>sexes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says that if men and women don't talk</v>

555
00:25:11.071 --> 00:25:12.780
<v Speaker 2>to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to harm both of us.</v>

556
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was much easier for them to paint</v>

557
00:25:15.031 --> 00:25:19.470
<v Speaker 2>him as a misogynist and as an outright </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure because I guess,</v>

558
00:25:19.471 --> 00:25:20.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing else going on the news.</v>

559
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:23.303
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel that the article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least when James was able to get </v>

560
00:25:27.271 --> 00:25:29.780
<v Speaker 1>out there and say what he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he did it here or,</v>

561
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.010
<v Speaker 1>or on Rogan or a series of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

562
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.293
<v Speaker 1>did you feel that that was able to break</v>
<v Speaker 1>through to some of the people that </v>

563
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.160
<v Speaker 1>needed to break through to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it gets to the masses,</v>

564
00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:38.994
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets to the people who appreciate </v>

565
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe what happens in here or on Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 1>or things like that,</v>

566
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.600
<v Speaker 1>but for any of the people that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to hear it,</v>

567
00:25:45.601 --> 00:25:49.500
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are at Google or the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are setting the diversity agenda at</v>

568
00:25:49.501 --> 00:25:52.980
<v Speaker 1>schools and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any sign that any of this,</v>

569
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.680
<v Speaker 1>a pushback against it has taken root?</v>

570
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.240
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's gotten worse,</v>

571
00:25:58.241 --> 00:25:59.140
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

572
00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:00.400
<v Speaker 2>which is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

573
00:26:00.401 --> 00:26:04.990
<v Speaker 2>I think they are so set in that mindset </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you really can't.</v>

574
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.860
<v Speaker 2>You can't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think reasonable people if you talk to</v>

575
00:26:08.861 --> 00:26:09.694
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was surprised actually at that time </v>

576
00:26:10.691 --> 00:26:13.600
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people that I knew that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were really intelligent,</v>

577
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:14.703
<v Speaker 2>really rational had bought into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative that he was a sexist person </v>

578
00:26:17.891 --> 00:26:18.724
<v Speaker 2>who said that women are biologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>inferior and are not capable of </v>

579
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.480
<v Speaker 2>engineering or working in tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

580
00:26:25.481 --> 00:26:26.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you think that?</v>

581
00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Did you read the memo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most people had not,</v>

582
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.940
<v Speaker 2>but then because the left wing media was</v>
<v Speaker 2>so adamant about this message,</v>

583
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.350
<v Speaker 2>people just assume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

584
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.710
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would they lie and you know,</v>

585
00:26:38.711 --> 00:26:40.600
<v Speaker 2>we are in this industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so of course we know,</v>

586
00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:42.790
<v Speaker 2>but I think most people just take it </v>
<v Speaker 2>face value.</v>

587
00:26:42.791 --> 00:26:43.624
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have their jobs and so they see a </v>

588
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 2>headline or they see an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just think,</v>

589
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a mainstream interview.</v>

590
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.550
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

591
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't be saying these things if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't some truth to them,</v>

592
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.500
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

593
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.560
<v Speaker 2>They're blatantly lying.</v>

594
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:56.543
<v Speaker 1>They're blatantly lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has all of this and being part of this </v>

595
00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:01.980
<v Speaker 1>and being very public about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>

596
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:02.814
<v Speaker 1>Has this changed your politics at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that it consistently has changed </v>

597
00:27:06.931 --> 00:27:10.500
<v Speaker 1>people's politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually it shifts people to more of what</v>

598
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I would say as a classical liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

599
00:27:12.001 --> 00:27:12.834
<v Speaker 1>but what a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just more of a less government position </v>

600
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.343
<v Speaker 1>because you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's where I think at the </v>

601
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most freedom lays.</v>

602
00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with that.</v>

603
00:27:22.631 --> 00:27:24.190
<v Speaker 2>And especially the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

604
00:27:24.191 --> 00:27:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be definitely more left,</v>

605
00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.520
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more left.</v>

606
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was still calling myself a liberal,</v>

607
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.753
<v Speaker 2>but definitely now that I see because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to think was good for the </v>

608
00:27:33.371 --> 00:27:36.100
<v Speaker 2>government to come in and help people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to kind of set the tone.</v>

609
00:27:36.101 --> 00:27:40.210
<v Speaker 2>But now now I'm seeing things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not hate speech or being considered hate</v>

610
00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:43.840
<v Speaker 2>speech and genuine facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not allowed to say them anymore.</v>

611
00:27:43.841 --> 00:27:44.674
<v Speaker 2>So I'm much more skeptical now of </v>
<v Speaker 2>government intervention of policies </v>

612
00:27:48.101 --> 00:27:50.200
<v Speaker 2>dictating what people can and cannot do </v>
<v Speaker 2>or say.</v>

613
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.420
<v Speaker 2>So I would say I have moved more to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

614
00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:54.220
<v Speaker 2>but I would still call myself a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

615
00:27:54.221 --> 00:27:57.680
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I write about sex research</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a living is pretty low.</v>

616
00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're my kind of liberal.</v>

617
00:27:59.271 --> 00:28:00.390
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good to go.</v>

618
00:28:00.391 --> 00:28:01.224
<v Speaker 1>In here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that I think is </v>

619
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 1>fascinating about all of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about here is that it's not just</v>

620
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:05.664
<v Speaker 1>about gender and sex and sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is also leaking into all sorts </v>

621
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:10.914
<v Speaker 1>of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about ethnicity and color of </v>

622
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:16.170
<v Speaker 1>skin and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

623
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.000
<v Speaker 1>you've written a bit about this.</v>

624
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:18.901
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

625
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about how a university </v>
<v Speaker 2>applications,</v>

626
00:28:22.081 --> 00:28:22.914
<v Speaker 2>and particularly Harvard has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminating against Asians for </v>

627
00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:29.130
<v Speaker 2>decades and how to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians,</v>

628
00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:29.964
<v Speaker 2>when they apply to university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will want to hide their ethnicity in </v>

629
00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:33.954
<v Speaker 2>hopes of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to give them a fair chance </v>

630
00:28:35.161 --> 00:28:35.860
<v Speaker 2>of actually getting into.</v>

631
00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.050
<v Speaker 1>So the school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

632
00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.893
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so somebody that's watching this right </v>

633
00:28:38.741 --> 00:28:40.390
<v Speaker 1>now that doesn't know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna go,</v>

634
00:28:40.391 --> 00:28:41.224
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would harvard discriminate against </v>

635
00:28:44.051 --> 00:28:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Asian people?</v>

636
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Because apparently there are too many </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians there.</v>

637
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.100
<v Speaker 2>If it's based solely on sat scores and </v>
<v Speaker 2>meritocracy,</v>

638
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:52.423
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very high proportion of Asian </v>

639
00:28:54.881 --> 00:28:55.714
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in the name of quote unquote </v>

640
00:28:57.581 --> 00:28:59.830
<v Speaker 2>diversity and inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

641
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Asian students get penalized.</v>

642
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:02.503
<v Speaker 1>So this to me is the most blatant </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of why this diversity stuff is </v>

643
00:29:08.691 --> 00:29:12.440
<v Speaker 1>complete nonsense because people on face</v>
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>

644
00:29:12.441 --> 00:29:14.780
<v Speaker 1>it seems nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to help people,</v>

645
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.943
<v Speaker 1>we want to help groups that maybe have </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggled more for whatever reason and </v>

646
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.950
<v Speaker 1>there's probably many good ways to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

647
00:29:21.951 --> 00:29:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe investing in more education or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever else.</v>

648
00:29:24.351 --> 00:29:25.184
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to hear your thoughts on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they take as a good thought </v>

649
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.830
<v Speaker 1>then they don't think all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

650
00:29:30.831 --> 00:29:33.710
<v Speaker 1>which means okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to have to punish people</v>

651
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.770
<v Speaker 1>who have worked very hard and done </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything right.</v>

652
00:29:36.771 --> 00:29:38.960
<v Speaker 1>And by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Asian community,</v>

653
00:29:38.961 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Chinese or Japanese or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean or whatever else,</v>

654
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:42.280
<v Speaker 1>have</v>

655
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.280
<v Speaker 2>worked really hard and put a focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>education and family.</v>

656
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 2>And then what is the result of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's now harder if not almost impossible</v>

657
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:54.400
<v Speaker 2>at some level to get into Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the craziest thing,</v>

658
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why people think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable.</v>

659
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 2>And even when I wrote that column,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a number of Asians reach out to me</v>

660
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

661
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:03.244
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be used as a token for the far </v>

662
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:06.940
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm totally okay with this,</v>

663
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:08.260
<v Speaker 2>this is fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking,</v>

664
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you on the times?</v>

665
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:12.263
<v Speaker 2>Do an op Ed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think by an Asian woman coming </v>

666
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.960
<v Speaker 2>mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

667
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Saying that this is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

668
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.903
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do it that you are fighting </v>

669
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:27.100
<v Speaker 2>for true equality that is simply not </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're fighting for.</v>

670
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's indoctrination at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

671
00:30:28.991 --> 00:30:29.824
<v Speaker 2>I think especially for the kids who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>applying to these schools and who are </v>

672
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:37.210
<v Speaker 2>okay with having to score much higher on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sat in order to get a fair chance.</v>

673
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I think they've just been told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

674
00:30:39.321 --> 00:30:41.530
<v Speaker 2>this is how it has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

675
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.393
<v Speaker 2>but this idea that it should be equality</v>
<v Speaker 2>and equality of outcome as opposed to </v>

676
00:30:46.181 --> 00:30:47.014
<v Speaker 2>opportunity is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is silly and it doesn't actually deal </v>

677
00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:54.190
<v Speaker 2>with actual differences in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>

678
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.593
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the differences that we see </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reasons why there are these </v>

679
00:30:57.461 --> 00:30:59.710
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not actually being addressed.</v>

680
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:00.783
<v Speaker 2>Please tell me that you got some nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>support from members of the Asian </v>

681
00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:07.410
<v Speaker 2>community that it wasn't just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>brainwashed lefties that were.</v>

682
00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.580
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

683
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I got across the board of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

684
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many races,</v>

685
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:12.243
<v Speaker 2>so I was grateful for that because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't sure how people were going to </v>

686
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:14.704
<v Speaker 2>respond to that piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I felt very strongly that I had to </v>

687
00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:17.104
<v Speaker 2>say something as Harvard issued a </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to any of this or do we even </v>

688
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:21.990
<v Speaker 2>know where they're at with all this?</v>

689
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.033
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know that the lawsuit is </v>

690
00:31:23.921 --> 00:31:26.130
<v Speaker 2>still ongoing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

691
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.380
<v Speaker 2>it really is just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are you with me on this?</v>

692
00:31:29.381 --> 00:31:30.214
<v Speaker 2>I sense that there's some massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>minority groups that are breaking right </v>

693
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:34.720
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Asian community,</v>

694
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:36.280
<v Speaker 2>because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate saying community,</v>

695
00:31:36.281 --> 00:31:37.114
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to use some words to describe </v>

696
00:31:38.171 --> 00:31:39.004
<v Speaker 2>how this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the black community is </v>

697
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:41.880
<v Speaker 2>breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what a lot of what candidates.</v>

698
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is talking about.</v>

699
00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I sent to this happening in the gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

700
00:31:45.461 --> 00:31:46.294
<v Speaker 2>I sent to this happening in the Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 2>community on very similarly because of </v>

701
00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:49.444
<v Speaker 2>the Asian community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of hard work and an education </v>

702
00:31:51.971 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so did you decide yet we have to put</v>

703
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:56.740
<v Speaker 2>you at the bottom of the oppression </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics.</v>

704
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's an interesting like,</v>

705
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:03.430
<v Speaker 2>strange alliance now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now building up or are you seeing that?</v>

706
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I could say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it coming.</v>

707
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.730
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

708
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.560
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about the bit about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

709
00:32:09.561 --> 00:32:13.690
<v Speaker 2>about how the left is going to eat its </v>
<v Speaker 2>own until there is only one person left.</v>

710
00:32:13.691 --> 00:32:14.524
<v Speaker 2>So it's only a matter of time really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to find each other and </v>

711
00:32:16.871 --> 00:32:17.201
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

712
00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:18.520
<v Speaker 2>we've had enough of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

713
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 2>gay men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys don't count.</v>

714
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't count to begin anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

715
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never wanted extra credit.</v>

716
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:26.770
<v Speaker 2>I wanted equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>

717
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.540
<v Speaker 2>equal credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not extra credit.</v>

718
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:30.483
<v Speaker 2>In a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually okay being thrown out in </v>

719
00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:35.500
<v Speaker 2>that regard of this pyramid because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to play that game.</v>

720
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>But I think actually finally some gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially</v>

721
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 1>gay white men because now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fully thought of as the enemy.</v>

722
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:44.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've even seen things on college </v>

723
00:32:45.111 --> 00:32:48.830
<v Speaker 1>campuses where lgbt organizations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

724
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:49.664
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be a gay white man and be the </v>

725
00:32:51.141 --> 00:32:53.330
<v Speaker 1>president of the organization because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

726
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>

727
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 1>That's really dangerous thinking.</v>

728
00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.383
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw what you had to deal with too at </v>

729
00:32:59.051 --> 00:33:02.530
<v Speaker 2>that professor who said that the lgbt </v>
<v Speaker 2>community doesn't want you at the.</v>

730
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Was it the University of University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Hampshire?</v>

731
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:05.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>

732
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.840
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't know at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think much of my audience will know</v>

733
00:33:09.841 --> 00:33:10.674
<v Speaker 1>what you're referring to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I spoke at University of New </v>

734
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:12.863
<v Speaker 1>Hampshire and there were all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>heckler's there and there was a trans </v>

735
00:33:14.401 --> 00:33:17.130
<v Speaker 1>woman who I did not know was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor.</v>

736
00:33:17.131 --> 00:33:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that until literally two </v>
<v Speaker 1>months later who was screaming at me how</v>

737
00:33:21.571 --> 00:33:23.820
<v Speaker 1>much I hate trans people and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I kept saying,</v>

738
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:24.863
<v Speaker 1>I want you to have equality under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law and I want you to be treated with </v>

739
00:33:27.811 --> 00:33:28.644
<v Speaker 1>decency and respect and I hope you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that loves you and all of the </v>

740
00:33:30.961 --> 00:33:34.380
<v Speaker 1>things I would want for anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want the government using a</v>

741
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.240
<v Speaker 1>dictating what pronouns I can use to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to refer to you and you know,</v>

742
00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:41.450
<v Speaker 1>basically she was calling me all right </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that it did.</v>

743
00:33:41.451 --> 00:33:44.430
<v Speaker 1>And of course it turns out she's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender studies professor.</v>

744
00:33:44.431 --> 00:33:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

745
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.130
<v Speaker 2>It should never be a surprise anymore,</v>

746
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.050
<v Speaker 1>but there's gonna be no discipline at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the school or anything like that.</v>

747
00:33:50.051 --> 00:33:51.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean I could probably make more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

748
00:33:51.791 --> 00:33:53.410
<v Speaker 1>have it and see what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

749
00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:54.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

750
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.600
<v Speaker 2>you handled it amazingly well and I mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only a matter of time.</v>

751
00:33:57.601 --> 00:34:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Like I see with feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're turning on white women now too.</v>

752
00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:03.060
<v Speaker 2>So it's insane.</v>

753
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.103
<v Speaker 1>Is that the only logical outcome of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these disciplines because they are not </v>

754
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:08.873
<v Speaker 1>held to the scientific standard of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else that we discussed here </v>

755
00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:14.730
<v Speaker 1>in the first app that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are held to as a scientist?</v>

756
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because everything is,</v>

757
00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:17.763
<v Speaker 2>there's so much based in subjective </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling and validating people's </v>

758
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:23.264
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You apparently can't question someone's </v>

759
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:26.984
<v Speaker 2>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if someone's offended or they don't </v>

760
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:31.100
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can you say?</v>

761
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:32.600
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see that and it's,</v>

762
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:35.840
<v Speaker 2>it's very much rewarding people for </v>
<v Speaker 2>being emotionally driven instead of,</v>

763
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.093
<v Speaker 2>I think the best way to have a debate as</v>
<v Speaker 2>to remove emotion and just try to look </v>

764
00:34:40.581 --> 00:34:43.550
<v Speaker 2>at the facts as objectively as you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what the issue is.</v>

765
00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:44.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

766
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:45.351
<v Speaker 2>it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

767
00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:48.410
<v Speaker 2>that they don't really have any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>method to how they do their,</v>

768
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 2>even their research is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

769
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:51.403
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a joke,</v>

770
00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:52.743
<v Speaker 1>but rob kind of hearing that even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>methods now are part of the patriarchy </v>

771
00:34:55.901 --> 00:34:59.320
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using facts,</v>

772
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:00.763
<v Speaker 1>they don't want facts to actually count </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they believe in this postmodern </v>

773
00:35:05.171 --> 00:35:06.004
<v Speaker 1>drivel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that facts have been arrived to by </v>

774
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.990
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms that they don't believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

775
00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough thing to trick somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of.</v>

776
00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

777
00:35:13.891 --> 00:35:17.130
<v Speaker 2>I think on some level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some of these scholars know that</v>

778
00:35:17.131 --> 00:35:17.964
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing is very lucrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're just basically trying to </v>

779
00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:23.040
<v Speaker 2>shut people down in any way they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't really justified,</v>

780
00:35:23.041 --> 00:35:23.874
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just keep screaming about it and </v>

781
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.383
<v Speaker 2>academics who have better things to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like actually do real research and </v>

782
00:35:30.151 --> 00:35:30.984
<v Speaker 2>they've got their courses and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>students and a million other things and </v>

783
00:35:33.781 --> 00:35:36.270
<v Speaker 2>their 80 hour work weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have time to deal with this.</v>

784
00:35:36.271 --> 00:35:37.104
<v Speaker 2>So this is why there's a lopsided </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse in terms of what you see </v>

785
00:35:40.561 --> 00:35:43.440
<v Speaker 2>coming out of the universities and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are some institutions that,</v>

786
00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:44.274
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they won't allow academics to engage </v>

787
00:35:46.591 --> 00:35:48.320
<v Speaker 2>with the media without permission for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

788
00:35:48.321 --> 00:35:49.710
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

789
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Speaker 2>it's really an unfair battle right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's being fought.</v>

790
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you think we get to a place where</v>

791
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:59.140
<v Speaker 1>specifically related to sexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>topics related to gender and sex,</v>

792
00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.020
<v Speaker 1>where we will be able to talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

793
00:36:02.021 --> 00:36:04.600
<v Speaker 1>in a better way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

794
00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 1>the me too movement where everybody I </v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

795
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:09.243
<v Speaker 1>I think basically thinking person </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands that there were some really </v>

796
00:36:12.671 --> 00:36:15.730
<v Speaker 1>bad people here that did some really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

797
00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.593
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Harvey Weinstein and Bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cosby and some people that really that </v>

798
00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.213
<v Speaker 1>drug people in that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of history of doing all this and </v>

799
00:36:24.371 --> 00:36:27.490
<v Speaker 1>then there's all sorts of other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who seem like they're just getting swept</v>

800
00:36:27.491 --> 00:36:28.324
<v Speaker 1>up in it or basically accused all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can be for the idea of the me </v>

801
00:36:32.591 --> 00:36:36.460
<v Speaker 1>too movement without being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for taking down.</v>

802
00:36:36.461 --> 00:36:37.294
<v Speaker 1>All of these other people are also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess what the real issue is </v>

803
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:44.140
<v Speaker 1>litigating everyone's history where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could all look back and go,</v>

804
00:36:44.141 --> 00:36:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone did that to me,</v>

805
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:47.171
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

806
00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:49.750
<v Speaker 1>the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>College kids now have an assigned things</v>

807
00:36:49.751 --> 00:36:50.584
<v Speaker 1>before they hook up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really where we're creating this </v>

808
00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:53.274
<v Speaker 1>situation where our interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations are going to have almost </v>

809
00:36:56.231 --> 00:36:59.950
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with the stuff that's hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>wired into us.</v>

810
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.150
<v Speaker 1>The stuff that you study</v>

811
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.193
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think me too probably started as </v>

812
00:37:04.071 --> 00:37:04.904
<v Speaker 2>something honorable and I do agree that </v>
<v Speaker 2>women and men have been dealing with </v>

813
00:37:08.451 --> 00:37:12.230
<v Speaker 2>harassment for far too long and that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get taken seriously sometimes,</v>

814
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's to the point now where </v>
<v Speaker 2>relations are so strained,</v>

815
00:37:15.081 --> 00:37:17.500
<v Speaker 2>especially between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

816
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I sense men are terrified and that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be helpful across the board for</v>

817
00:37:22.311 --> 00:37:23.780
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

818
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I think especially when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>shades of gray,</v>

819
00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.853
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so much I could say on </v>

820
00:37:28.401 --> 00:37:29.234
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think what's the best </v>

821
00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:31.900
<v Speaker 2>place to start would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

822
00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.193
<v Speaker 2>with consent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say I think one message that's been </v>

823
00:37:36.651 --> 00:37:38.240
<v Speaker 2>missing is women I've written about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

824
00:37:38.241 --> 00:37:39.074
<v Speaker 2>Women need to advocate for themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not to say if you were </v>

825
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.690
<v Speaker 2>experienced harassment or if you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>assaulted that you are at fault.</v>

826
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:48.973
<v Speaker 2>I'm not advocating victim blaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think what's missing from this </v>

827
00:37:52.011 --> 00:37:52.844
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are portrayed as though they're </v>

828
00:37:54.531 --> 00:37:56.450
<v Speaker 2>helpless and if something happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

829
00:37:56.451 --> 00:37:58.150
<v Speaker 2>they're helpless and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

830
00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:59.183
<v Speaker 2>they're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no say in terms of how men </v>

831
00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.570
<v Speaker 2>behave towards them.</v>

832
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.433
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written about sexism in the </v>

833
00:38:04.521 --> 00:38:08.180
<v Speaker 2>sciences and how women are basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>being scared off,</v>

834
00:38:08.181 --> 00:38:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I think of going into the field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

835
00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:13.910
<v Speaker 2>as someone with a phd in a science </v>
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>

836
00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You deal with sexism and it's </v>

837
00:38:16.191 --> 00:38:17.024
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I still got my degree and now I'm </v>

838
00:38:19.371 --> 00:38:22.880
<v Speaker 2>speaking out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to achieve something,</v>

839
00:38:22.881 --> 00:38:23.301
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

840
00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:26.660
<v Speaker 2>sexism is not so terrible in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that women can't achieve what they want.</v>

841
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.460
<v Speaker 2>So going back to consent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:38:28.461 --> 00:38:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I think women need young women </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>

843
00:38:31.021 --> 00:38:31.940
<v Speaker 2>you needed to be told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

844
00:38:31.941 --> 00:38:32.774
<v Speaker 2>you have a say in this if you don't like</v>
<v Speaker 2>something or if you don't want to do </v>

845
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say so,</v>

846
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.290
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't feel like it's on the man to um,</v>

847
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.400
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read your mind and I feel like I'm going</v>

848
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:44.350
<v Speaker 2>to get in so much trouble for saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

849
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think that empowers women instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of telling them,</v>

850
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just really hope that this doesn't </v>

851
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 2>happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it does,</v>

852
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:52.444
<v Speaker 2>then get on twitter and use the Hashtag </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talk about how men are terrible and </v>

853
00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 2>men are trash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men are not terrible.</v>

854
00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 2>They're lovely men in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love men.</v>

855
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some bad men,</v>

856
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 2>but you can't generalize to all men.</v>

857
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we love the generalizations.</v>

858
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.010
<v Speaker 1>It's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

859
00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 1>you even see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of articles where I see,</v>

860
00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to take down white.</v>

861
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.160
<v Speaker 1>It's always white men that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take down or,</v>

862
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.233
<v Speaker 1>or now it's women's turn to rule the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world or all of these things and it's </v>

863
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

864
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:20.740
<v Speaker 1>a woman could be president or a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>

865
00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that a man could be,</v>

866
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.560
<v Speaker 1>but it shouldn't be because she's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

867
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:29.280
<v Speaker 1>It should be because she's capable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

868
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:33.700
<v Speaker 1>but we've seen this sort of hysterical </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to it and I think that that now</v>

869
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:34.683
<v Speaker 1>is just another one of these places </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're on this crazy pendulum just </v>

870
00:39:37.331 --> 00:39:38.410
<v Speaker 1>bouncing back and forth.</v>

871
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping it's going to come back to </v>

872
00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:41.340
<v Speaker 2>the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

873
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.230
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully not too much damage will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be done before that happens and that the</v>

874
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.890
<v Speaker 2>relations between men and women or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be so terribly strange.</v>

875
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:50.283
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think we're reaching that point </v>

876
00:39:51.261 --> 00:39:54.380
<v Speaker 2>though because there are only so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>men left to have it been accused of a me</v>

877
00:39:54.381 --> 00:39:55.300
<v Speaker 2>too moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

878
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only a matter of time.</v>

879
00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:58.181
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

880
00:39:58.181 --> 00:39:59.014
<v Speaker 1>I have a running joke with some of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends that I know a lot of great </v>

881
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:06.250
<v Speaker 1>straight girls in La that are single lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of straight great girls.</v>

882
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.833
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of straight guys that I think are </v>

883
00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:11.314
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know I know some straight guys </v>

884
00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:13.744
<v Speaker 1>that are kinda whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know like a lot of straight </v>

885
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:19.210
<v Speaker 1>guys that kind of have their shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>together that are.</v>

886
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 1>So I have all these girls that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

887
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 1>you set me up with a guy and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 1>not guys I know,</v>

888
00:40:24.371 --> 00:40:25.204
<v Speaker 1>which does show that there's sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis I think in masculinity or </v>

889
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:28.831
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

890
00:40:28.831 --> 00:40:32.080
<v Speaker 1>and obviously Jordan Peterson is </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing this at some level,</v>

891
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:33.310
<v Speaker 1>although now I've spent so much time </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>

892
00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I think he's addressing it in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

893
00:40:34.811 --> 00:40:35.644
<v Speaker 1>You almost equally for men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although people only focus on the male </v>

894
00:40:38.681 --> 00:40:39.760
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you know,</v>

895
00:40:39.761 --> 00:40:40.594
<v Speaker 1>is anyone doing research on sort of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is happening to young men in particular </v>

896
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:46.594
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

897
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Hm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

898
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:49.483
<v Speaker 2>I know that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of testosterone are lower on </v>

899
00:40:51.981 --> 00:40:55.580
<v Speaker 2>average more recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if that has something to</v>

900
00:40:55.581 --> 00:40:56.414
<v Speaker 2>do with it.</v>

901
00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Do we know what the reasoning for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>

902
00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's more estrogens that are,</v>

903
00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:02.474
<v Speaker 2>that we're putting into our bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think of what I can give </v>

904
00:41:06.021 --> 00:41:07.340
<v Speaker 2>you [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting.</v>

905
00:41:07.341 --> 00:41:09.410
<v Speaker 2>So how old are your friends?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious.</v>

906
00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:10.523
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of set of friends that I'm </v>

907
00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These girls usually are in,</v>

908
00:41:13.841 --> 00:41:16.240
<v Speaker 1>they're sorta like early thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

909
00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>

910
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:18.160
<v Speaker 1>and they're single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

911
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most often cases,</v>

912
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:20.944
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their friends are married already and </v>

913
00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:24.310
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on the hunt and they've got good</v>

914
00:41:24.311 --> 00:41:25.144
<v Speaker 1>jobs and they look good and they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of themselves and all of those </v>

915
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:27.604
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just don't see the equivalent </v>

916
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:30.430
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

917
00:41:30.431 --> 00:41:31.264
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's an odd subset of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because la is like a little bit of an </v>

918
00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:35.300
<v Speaker 1>odd place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's more gay people here.</v>

919
00:41:35.301 --> 00:41:35.991
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

920
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:36.824
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

921
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

922
00:41:37.681 --> 00:41:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I could say the average age for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting married as 28,</v>

923
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.153
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to generalize and say that </v>

924
00:41:43.591 --> 00:41:47.010
<v Speaker 2>across the board you sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible and to be fair,</v>

925
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it could be that for guys who</v>

926
00:41:50.131 --> 00:41:53.250
<v Speaker 2>are a certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a reason,</v>

927
00:41:53.251 --> 00:41:54.990
<v Speaker 2>but at the same thing for women of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain age,</v>

928
00:41:54.991 --> 00:41:56.490
<v Speaker 2>and not to say that your friends of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

929
00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.470
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

930
00:41:58.471 --> 00:41:59.304
<v Speaker 2>if you're focused on your career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're not used to giving your </v>

931
00:42:02.491 --> 00:42:04.320
<v Speaker 2>time to someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be part of it.</v>

932
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

933
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the feminist movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I know is sort of,</v>

934
00:42:08.671 --> 00:42:09.504
<v Speaker 1>we sort of ancillary been talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it this whole time that they really did </v>

935
00:42:13.441 --> 00:42:14.274
<v Speaker 1>give up something very special by </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting so much focus on work and </v>

936
00:42:18.871 --> 00:42:20.600
<v Speaker 1>success in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

937
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:22.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think back to my childhood now,</v>

938
00:42:22.471 --> 00:42:25.020
<v Speaker 1>which I think in retrospect was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

939
00:42:25.021 --> 00:42:28.800
<v Speaker 1>My mom was home for most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

940
00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:30.690
<v Speaker 1>she worked before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the oldest of three.</v>

941
00:42:30.691 --> 00:42:31.524
<v Speaker 1>She worked before I was there and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't work all the years that she </v>

942
00:42:34.291 --> 00:42:36.510
<v Speaker 1>was raising us and then went back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work after,</v>

943
00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that having someone at home that was</v>

944
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.823
<v Speaker 1>cooking and taking care of us and making</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure we got to school and all of those </v>

945
00:42:42.931 --> 00:42:44.070
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

946
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.650
<v Speaker 1>that's like the greatest thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone could do.</v>

947
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:50.420
<v Speaker 1>It happens to more often be the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a,</v>

948
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's often been sacrifice.</v>

949
00:42:53.001 --> 00:42:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Now we're thought of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's marked in a way.</v>

950
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

951
00:42:56.211 --> 00:42:59.120
<v Speaker 2>I've always been a atypical in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

952
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.983
<v Speaker 2>I've always been felt more masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been very focused on my </v>

953
00:43:02.361 --> 00:43:03.310
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

954
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:08.710
<v Speaker 2>but I definitely think that feminism and</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some people it or some proponents of</v>

955
00:43:09.771 --> 00:43:10.604
<v Speaker 2>feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will denigrate female typical </v>

956
00:43:12.891 --> 00:43:13.730
<v Speaker 2>roles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

957
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.760
<v Speaker 2>and motherhood and wanting to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

958
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:19.440
<v Speaker 2>at home with your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think I've,</v>

959
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:21.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard from women who say,</v>

960
00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:21.873
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been told that the path to </v>

961
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:26.990
<v Speaker 2>happiness is for me to focus on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>career and to neglect my personal life.</v>

962
00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:28.620
<v Speaker 2>And then they reach a point where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>

963
00:43:28.621 --> 00:43:30.620
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do want those things and I don't think</v>

964
00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:32.180
<v Speaker 2>there should be anything wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

965
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.350
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

966
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I've written about how there's such an </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasis for,</v>

967
00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:39.410
<v Speaker 2>for girls to be like boys now I saw you </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweet about babies,</v>

968
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:40.583
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And underlying that is a sexism that it </v>

969
00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:48.850
<v Speaker 2>says that girls need to be like boys in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to be equal or worthy of respect.</v>

970
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:52.430
<v Speaker 2>And no one's talking about that where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are just saying,</v>

971
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:53.121
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

972
00:43:53.121 --> 00:43:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

973
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.170
<v Speaker 2>tell girls that they have to be the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>as boys and women have to be the same as</v>

974
00:43:57.171 --> 00:43:57.460
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

975
00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the article you're referring to,</v>

976
00:43:58.890 --> 00:43:59.723
<v Speaker 1>there was this piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Newsweek that these </v>

977
00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.740
<v Speaker 1>parents are raising their twins as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabian t,</v>

978
00:44:05.741 --> 00:44:08.170
<v Speaker 1>h e y babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies,</v>

979
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to let them pick their</v>

980
00:44:10.901 --> 00:44:11.734
<v Speaker 1>gender and it's like you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create more psychological problems then </v>

981
00:44:16.931 --> 00:44:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you were trying to hide them from most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely,</v>

982
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.113
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

983
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it goes back to biology again,</v>

984
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.660
<v Speaker 2>and hormonal exposure in utero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

985
00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

986
00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.160
<v Speaker 1>It might've been NBC news I think.</v>

987
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

988
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Newsweek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

989
00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

990
00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.143
<v Speaker 2>I think there are a couple outlets that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were so excited about this and the </v>

991
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:34.950
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was why I wrote about it.</v>

992
00:44:34.951 --> 00:44:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Not because of the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:36.864
<v Speaker 2>these parents can do whatever they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I followed up with </v>

994
00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.293
<v Speaker 2>immediately after an appearance can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want and then when the </v>

995
00:44:40.831 --> 00:44:41.664
<v Speaker 2>children are of age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can either decide my parents were </v>

996
00:44:43.051 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 2>crazy or not write this on the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

997
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:47.910
<v Speaker 2>And all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was.</v>

998
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.983
<v Speaker 2>But that wasn't the issue for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was that the way these headlines are </v>

999
00:44:51.201 --> 00:44:53.640
<v Speaker 2>always written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that this was like this is the</v>

1000
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:54.474
<v Speaker 2>new thing and the implicit piece of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you better do this to be a good </v>

1001
00:44:59.671 --> 00:45:00.504
<v Speaker 2>parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get tolerant parent to be a </v>

1002
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 2>progressive parents and that open minded</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1003
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 2>And that to me is the danger here.</v>

1004
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:08.783
<v Speaker 2>Not The little isolated case necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>have these people that are doing </v>

1005
00:45:11.281 --> 00:45:12.960
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an outlier thing.</v>

1006
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:14.483
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard stories now where people are </v>

1007
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:16.794
<v Speaker 2>terrified of giving their daughters </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolls and which is what's really funny </v>

1008
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:19.674
<v Speaker 2>is you have some of these really </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive parents who raise their </v>

1009
00:45:22.321 --> 00:45:23.154
<v Speaker 2>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only have gender neutral toys or </v>

1010
00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:25.014
<v Speaker 2>they give them boys toys and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl obviously goes to school and sees </v>

1011
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.720
<v Speaker 2>girl typical toys and wants to play with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1012
00:45:30.721 --> 00:45:32.280
<v Speaker 2>And the parents were horrified and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1013
00:45:32.281 --> 00:45:33.114
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the patriarchy coming in return </v>

1014
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.580
<v Speaker 2>of the is biology and we shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of that.</v>

1015
00:45:38.581 --> 00:45:39.414
<v Speaker 2>And we shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't shame girls for wanting to </v>

1016
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:42.030
<v Speaker 2>be female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Typical.</v>

1017
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is why when people say,</v>

1018
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I think to a bunch of us that are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this space,</v>

1019
00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:46.291
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1020
00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:48.660
<v Speaker 1>you guys are overstating what this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1021
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:51.600
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bunch of angry activist or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1022
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:52.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like we've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1023
00:45:52.981 --> 00:45:55.410
<v Speaker 1>academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you addressed already.</v>

1024
00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:56.670
<v Speaker 1>We've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1025
00:45:56.671 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 1>the home and how you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise your kids.</v>

1026
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Even just thinking about this now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1027
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:01.913
<v Speaker 1>I think I read something on this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and if not there's definite proof </v>

1028
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:07.530
<v Speaker 1>of it that Disney made a decision along </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

1029
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:08.364
<v Speaker 1>Now that they have star wars and marvel </v>
<v Speaker 1>that star wars was going to be more </v>

1030
00:46:11.671 --> 00:46:14.700
<v Speaker 1>marketed to girls and marvel was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the boy's thing.</v>

1031
00:46:14.701 --> 00:46:15.534
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm a big star wars guy and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>see these commercials and it was all </v>

1032
00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:19.051
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1033
00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:21.420
<v Speaker 1>girls in the ships and grows with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>light lightsabers live.</v>

1034
00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously a rave,</v>

1035
00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.400
<v Speaker 1>a leading character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last one is a girl.</v>

1036
00:46:26.401 --> 00:46:27.670
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The girls can do that,</v>

1037
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:28.623
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But pushing marketing on them seems odd </v>

1038
00:46:31.621 --> 00:46:32.160
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1039
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:32.993
<v Speaker 1>and although I'm sure there are many </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl girls out there that want to be a </v>

1040
00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.840
<v Speaker 1>jetta I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously more boys.</v>

1041
00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:40.674
<v Speaker 1>So the way that we even market and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspect they're marketing in a way </v>

1042
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:43.464
<v Speaker 1>that's hurting their bottom line in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>name of tolerance in the name of what I </v>

1043
00:46:48.751 --> 00:46:49.210
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

1044
00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:49.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1045
00:46:49.961 --> 00:46:51.250
<v Speaker 2>how did the boys feel about that?</v>

1046
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.501
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1047
00:46:52.501 --> 00:46:54.580
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to get this odd thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll eventually,</v>

1048
00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:55.443
<v Speaker 1>if there enough marketing boys are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to want to play with the girl thing and </v>

1049
00:46:57.721 --> 00:46:58.770
<v Speaker 1>then feel weird about it.</v>

1050
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:01.160
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's messed up.</v>

1051
00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:03.440
<v Speaker 2>How much time did you have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much time on their hands.</v>

1052
00:47:03.441 --> 00:47:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1053
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:05.183
<v Speaker 2>Just say like kids do what they want and</v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledged that as long as you give </v>

1054
00:47:08.061 --> 00:47:08.894
<v Speaker 2>them free choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably won't have too much say at </v>

1055
00:47:11.661 --> 00:47:12.920
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least you know,</v>

1056
00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.270
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll be happy.</v>

1057
00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1058
00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.730
<v Speaker 1>is there anything else that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>researching at the moment or that's been</v>

1059
00:47:18.731 --> 00:47:20.250
<v Speaker 1>on your mind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1060
00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:21.310
<v Speaker 1>that we haven't covered?</v>

1061
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I would say is,</v>

1062
00:47:23.331 --> 00:47:26.070
<v Speaker 2>so with [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are going to be launching our second.</v>

1063
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:28.500
<v Speaker 2>We just launched our first season last </v>
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>

1064
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so spoke with James Damore,</v>

1065
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.143
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay Shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also did an episode on rapid onset </v>

1066
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:33.934
<v Speaker 2>gender dysphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's this phenomenon of adolescent </v>

1067
00:47:36.611 --> 00:47:37.444
<v Speaker 2>girls who were suddenly saying they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender even though they've had no </v>

1068
00:47:39.491 --> 00:47:40.324
<v Speaker 2>previous signs of gender dysphoria and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually their problems have nothing to </v>

1069
00:47:43.091 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 2>do with gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are the problems?</v>

1070
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:46.504
<v Speaker 2>That's just societal stuff or pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>or wanting attention or all of the </v>

1071
00:47:49.541 --> 00:47:51.550
<v Speaker 2>above.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually autism as well,</v>

1072
00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 2>so they either will be diagnosed by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental professional,</v>

1073
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:57.910
<v Speaker 2>but the person will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that I have to,</v>

1074
00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affirm your child's gender.</v>

1075
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:01.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they can otherwise get a lot of </v>

1076
00:48:02.111 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 2>trouble and lose their jobs if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1077
00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.113
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you repeat that again so that they will </v>

1078
00:48:08.681 --> 00:48:11.610
<v Speaker 2>lose their jobs if they don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>affirm their.</v>

1079
00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:17.020
<v Speaker 2>They have two clinicians nowadays have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to affirm these kids.</v>

1080
00:48:17.021 --> 00:48:19.060
<v Speaker 2>If a child says they're transgender and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

1081
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:22.010
<v Speaker 2>they'll lose their jobs otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1082
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:22.953
<v Speaker 2>so technically a therapist or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinician could feel that this is some </v>

1083
00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:28.744
<v Speaker 2>other issue going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to actually affirm what </v>

1084
00:48:32.891 --> 00:48:34.420
<v Speaker 2>the child says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1085
00:48:34.421 --> 00:48:38.530
<v Speaker 2>the parents and in all the documents </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they will lose their jobs.</v>

1086
00:48:38.531 --> 00:48:40.570
<v Speaker 2>They're terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in Toronto,</v>

1087
00:48:40.571 --> 00:48:41.620
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1088
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.290
<v Speaker 2>what the Preston case was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1089
00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:44.670
<v Speaker 2>my colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenneth Zucker,</v>

1090
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.233
<v Speaker 2>I had a clinic where he saw gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>dysphoric children and people said that </v>

1091
00:48:50.081 --> 00:48:52.270
<v Speaker 2>he was practicing conversion therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was not.</v>

1092
00:48:52.271 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 2>So conversion therapy I do not stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

1093
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.490
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to turn gay children's </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight,</v>

1094
00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.010
<v Speaker 2>but sexual orientation is not the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing as gender,</v>

1095
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:04.090
<v Speaker 2>so gender and young children is flexible</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes more stable with age.</v>

1096
00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:08.080
<v Speaker 2>So when he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when patients would come to him and say,</v>

1097
00:49:08.081 --> 00:49:09.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be the opposite sex,</v>

1098
00:49:09.401 --> 00:49:10.020
<v Speaker 2>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1099
00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:13.120
<v Speaker 2>what's the underlying resentment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say gender is flexible,</v>

1100
00:49:13.121 --> 00:49:13.954
<v Speaker 2>you don't mean the amount of genders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean the feeling that you have </v>

1101
00:49:16.451 --> 00:49:18.500
<v Speaker 2>related to gender?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be clean.</v>

1102
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I know there are two genders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be clear on that.</v>

1103
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1104
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.380
<v Speaker 2>so if you have an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even using,</v>

1105
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:29.230
<v Speaker 2>if you have a little boy who says he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

1106
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.573
<v Speaker 2>he will likely be a gay man and he will </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely grow to be comfortable in his </v>

1107
00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:34.864
<v Speaker 2>male gender identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for 99 percent of us are biological </v>

1108
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:38.470
<v Speaker 2>sex is our gender,</v>

1109
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.500
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1110
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.260
<v Speaker 2>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1111
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a real monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1112
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:47.010
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of misinformation out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1113
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.710
<v Speaker 2>So what I was saying with my colleague </v>
<v Speaker 2>has clinic got shut down.</v>

1114
00:49:49.711 --> 00:49:52.020
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't doing anything unethical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because of that,</v>

1115
00:49:52.021 --> 00:49:53.820
<v Speaker 2>it's set this chill across the field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1116
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.833
<v Speaker 2>clinicians do not do not want to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing happened to them because </v>

1117
00:49:57.601 --> 00:49:58.434
<v Speaker 2>activists will go after them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one really practicing or </v>

1118
00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:03.323
<v Speaker 2>anyone sort of thought of as legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's practicing conversion therapy </v>

1119
00:50:05.611 --> 00:50:06.444
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there?</v>

1120
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:09.770
<v Speaker 2>I hope not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing against it,</v>

1121
00:50:09.771 --> 00:50:10.604
<v Speaker 2>like the that it just never worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was just something that I guess </v>

1122
00:50:14.461 --> 00:50:15.294
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Idealogue was practicing not using real </v>

1123
00:50:18.961 --> 00:50:23.190
<v Speaker 2>evidence or science and it just fizzled </v>
<v Speaker 2>out basically.</v>

1124
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I do think there are some practitioners </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are still doing it.</v>

1125
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't call them legitimate,</v>

1126
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.460
<v Speaker 2>which it makes me very uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see that,</v>

1127
00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:33.403
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely sexual orientation is </v>

1128
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.910
<v Speaker 2>biological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's genetic and it can't be changed,</v>

1129
00:50:37.911 --> 00:50:41.570
<v Speaker 2>so conversion therapy is completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>useless.</v>

1130
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm glad we got it.</v>

1131
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:45.403
<v Speaker 1>At least I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most people won't be angry at </v>

1132
00:50:46.931 --> 00:50:47.711
<v Speaker 1>you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1133
00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe some people on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be angry on that one,</v>

1134
00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1135
00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:53.973
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about presenting the data and </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking to facts and the science and </v>

1136
00:50:56.781 --> 00:50:59.900
<v Speaker 2>standing up for sex research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it infuriates people on the left</v>

1137
00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:00.734
<v Speaker 2>or the right.</v>

1138
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science facts reason pretty much.</v>

1139
00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much all but all sort of packaged</v>
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>

1140
00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.630
<v Speaker 1>within the free speech thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Can I call you a member of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual dark web?</v>

1142
00:51:12.091 --> 00:51:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Please do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I have that power,</v>

1143
00:51:15.961 --> 00:51:16.794
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clubhouse later and I'm going to get me </v>

1144
00:51:19.051 --> 00:51:19.851
<v Speaker 1>a membership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1145
00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:20.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1146
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.580
<v Speaker 1>we have to vote on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing and we can be a white</v>

1147
00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:25.590
<v Speaker 1>man some days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1148
00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:26.550
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing.</v>

1149

<v Speaker 1>All these idiots that are writing all </v>

<v Speaker 2>I've been called a white supremacist.</v>
