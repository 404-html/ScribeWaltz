00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Joining me on the show this week is </v>
<v Speaker 1>author,</v>

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>speaker and Associate Director of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry Jackson Society,</v>

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:08.184
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been familiar with douglass work </v>

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.833
<v Speaker 1>for almost a year now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name kept popping up in my twitter </v>

5
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>feed after the Charlie Hebdo shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like last week's guest,</v>

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.533
<v Speaker 1>Ayaan Hirsi Ali Douglas has been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relentless defender of free speech even </v>

7
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:21.384
<v Speaker 1>when it isn't popular to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of my awakening about the </v>

8
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:24.774
<v Speaker 1>regressive left came around the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time as Charlie Hebdo when I saw more </v>

9
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>concerned for political correctness then</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the victims of the horrific attack.</v>

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.053
<v Speaker 1>I was really impressed with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas is clean and clear explanation </v>

11
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>of why free speech must be protected at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all costs.</v>

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the issues we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about today.</v>

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>This is where I should tell you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Murray is a neo-con.</v>

14
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>The word neo-con sounds kind of evil to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

15
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Sorta like a decepticon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>and like decepticons neocons are big on </v>
<v Speaker 1>world domination,</v>

17
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>or are they.</v>

18
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're going to find out </v>

19
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>when we talked to Douglas today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:57.474
<v Speaker 1>we get so lost in throwing around labels</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time that we hardly know what </v>

21
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:01.194
<v Speaker 1>they mean anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I understand that a neo-con is </v>

22
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>someone who wants to spread democracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>through military intervention and we all</v>

23
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>know how well that usually works out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

24
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.953
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is just generally thought of </v>

25
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>in the American Lens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it the same for the British?</v>

26
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>I want to find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I way off altogether?</v>

27
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:18.264
<v Speaker 1>I want to find that out too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're going to talk </v>

28
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you might be thinking,</v>

29
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been labeling the regressive left</v>

30
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:24.174
<v Speaker 1>for weeks now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that different than labeling </v>

31
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>someone to neo-con?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the thing is here that we had to</v>

32
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:29.934
<v Speaker 1>identify what the regressive left stands</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us so that we could also identify </v>

33
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>what we stand for.</v>

34
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>As I've said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt the need to talk about the lunacy</v>

35
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:37.734
<v Speaker 1>on the left because there just weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough voices amplifying the battle of </v>

36
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>ideas that you guys all want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're here.</v>

37
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I'm going to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

38
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>So today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I sit here with someone firmly on the</v>

39
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scary neoconservative,</v>

40
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.683
<v Speaker 1>let's all have a battle of ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually listened to what he says and </v>

41
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:55.944
<v Speaker 1>then formulate opinions on those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not do what the regressive left </v>

42
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is label someone and then prejudge</v>

43
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>everything they say based on that very </v>
<v Speaker 1>label.</v>

44
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.353
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreement and everything in between </v>

45
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.563
<v Speaker 1>and it's our ability to have those </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest conversations and know that </v>

46
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>people we disagree with can feel as just</v>
<v Speaker 1>an as principled as we do.</v>

47
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the spirit that I'll continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do this show in.</v>

48
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>While I do want to continue having these</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of conversations,</v>

49
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:22.764
<v Speaker 1>I also want to assure you guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be widening the net </v>

50
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>around here as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk politics,</v>

51
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

52
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

53
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>free speech and the battle of ideas will</v>
<v Speaker 1>always be a mainstay,</v>

54
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to become a one trick </v>
<v Speaker 1>pony either.</v>

55
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.603
<v Speaker 1>Next week I have two people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting many of the ideas we've been </v>

56
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:38.964
<v Speaker 1>talking about into action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Keys and Faisal Al Mutar from </v>

57
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:43.194
<v Speaker 1>advancing human rights.org.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're using the tools of democracy to </v>

58
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:48.264
<v Speaker 1>help advance human rights in parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world where the people are most </v>

59
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>effected by the ideas we've been talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

60
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>The point is I'm going to keep mixing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

61
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>keep letting me know what you guys think</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who you want me to talk to.</v>

62
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.003
<v Speaker 1>Most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's keep pushing the conversation </v>

63
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>forward so we can build bridges where </v>
<v Speaker 1>others were just tear them down.</v>

64
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Murray is an author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a journalist,</v>

65
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:10.684
<v Speaker 1>and atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a neoconservative and an outspoken </v>

66
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>defender of free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas,</v>

67
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>now that I've labeled you all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

68
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:18.184
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the show.</v>

69
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Very nice to be with you.</v>

70
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I told you right before we started that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.380
<v Speaker 1>we've only been doing this show for </v>
<v Speaker 1>about two months now,</v>

72
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.513
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you by far I've had more requests to </v>

73
00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:28.754
<v Speaker 1>have you on then pretty much anyone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you seem you seem to be like </v>

74
00:03:32.301 --> 00:03:33.134
<v Speaker 1>this sort of hub of free speech and free</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and that even though I think </v>

75
00:03:38.481 --> 00:03:40.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe we don't line up exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>

76
00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:41.384
<v Speaker 1>people wanted to see us sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm excited that you took a little </v>

77
00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:45.494
<v Speaker 1>time here.</v>

78
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 2>I look forward to hearing our </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

79
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.131
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

80
00:03:50.131 --> 00:03:50.964
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first what I want to start with is </v>

81
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:53.184
<v Speaker 1>the word neoconservative because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really the first thing that if someone </v>

82
00:03:56.461 --> 00:04:00.690
<v Speaker 1>googles you that pops up that you were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>neoconservative or a neo con.</v>

83
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Now I know since I come from the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a real buzzword for my people.</v>

84
00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:07.470
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they freak out on this.</v>

85
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I think that you're some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperialist,</v>

86
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:11.010
<v Speaker 1>this kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first I thought,</v>

87
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.023
<v Speaker 1>well let's just get what the definition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of neoconservative ism is from you </v>

88
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.213
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

89
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 2>It's quite nice to know that's the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that comes up on Google.</v>

90
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.263
<v Speaker 2>What I expected far words were basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have been moved from the left in </v>

91
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 2>the postwar period in America and </v>
<v Speaker 2>famously described themselves.</v>

92
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been crystal as being.</v>

93
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Liberals have been mugged by reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that now I wrote a,</v>

94
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book on neo-cons about 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago now.</v>

95
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is,</v>

96
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 2>is that the word neoconservatives with </v>
<v Speaker 2>ms.so</v>

97
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 2>filled with pejorative connotations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone thinks they know what they mean</v>

98
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:54.710
<v Speaker 2>by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

99
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book partly to correct those </v>
<v Speaker 2>ms dot apprehensions.</v>

100
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it was remotely </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful in that regard.</v>

101
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

102
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.021
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

103
00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

104
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that bothered about the term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is interesting and it remains</v>

105
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.763
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movement of people from a liberal </v>

106
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:15.690
<v Speaker 2>position as it were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

107
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.863
<v Speaker 2>but apart from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think has gotten relatively little </v>

108
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 2>relevance today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the word is probably noxious for</v>

109
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 2>at least a generation,</v>

110
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think within an American context,</v>

111
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.950
<v Speaker 1>it basically means using military force </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spread democracy.</v>

112
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that fair to say?</v>

113
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

114
00:05:34.581 --> 00:05:35.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

115
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.500
<v Speaker 2>mainly no conservatives in America where</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not interested in foreign policy.</v>

116
00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:40.400
<v Speaker 2>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

117
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.190
<v Speaker 2>certainly a glitch weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

118
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.300
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

119
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.760
<v Speaker 2>certainly in recent years it's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived.</v>

120
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.750
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that in terms of bringing</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy,</v>

121
00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:48.584
<v Speaker 2>I think the most striking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neoconservative foreign policy idea was </v>

122
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:56.090
<v Speaker 2>really that idea that you could use </v>
<v Speaker 2>military force for humanitarian means.</v>

123
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 2>It partly solved a sort of imbroglio </v>
<v Speaker 2>that cut for a long time by that point,</v>

124
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 2>which was that people on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadly speaking,</v>

125
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 2>didn't believe in the use of force and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on the right,</v>

126
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.024
<v Speaker 2>broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't think that humanitarian </v>

127
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:10.124
<v Speaker 2>catastrophes where the sort of thing you</v>
<v Speaker 2>use the military for neoconservatives </v>

128
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>were few people to sort of meld these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things together and say actually,</v>

129
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:18.314
<v Speaker 2>as in the Balkans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the use of military force to alleviate </v>

130
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.003
<v Speaker 2>human suffering and to prevent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that case even worse genocide </v>

131
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 2>occurred was a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

132
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

133
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.930
<v Speaker 2>as we all know the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

134
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.943
<v Speaker 2>if it's possible for a neoconservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a liberal who's been mugged by </v>

135
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:35.594
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I think it's probably possible now </v>

136
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 2>to be a neoconservatives who's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>mugged by reality as well.</v>

137
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.933
<v Speaker 1>So I guess this is why labels just suck </v>
<v Speaker 1>in general because I think what you're </v>

138
00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:45.364
<v Speaker 1>saying is there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's various lines through here that </v>

139
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:49.294
<v Speaker 1>you could be someone that does believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in nation building and obviously there </v>

140
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:53.704
<v Speaker 1>are some people that do believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation building and then you could be </v>

141
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:56.404
<v Speaker 1>someone that just purely believes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervening on Humira and humanitarian </v>

142
00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:03.910
<v Speaker 1>regards and probably several other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things beneath that.</v>

143
00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:04.744
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

144
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.633
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that thing of that being a sort </v>

145
00:07:07.411 --> 00:07:09.180
<v Speaker 2>of coalition with people from left and </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

146
00:07:09.181 --> 00:07:10.014
<v Speaker 2>who certainly met I think in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties over the Balkans mess again in </v>

147
00:07:13.861 --> 00:07:15.930
<v Speaker 2>a bit and the early part of the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>decade,</v>

148
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.793
<v Speaker 2>but I think since that aligns that </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurred is suddenly gone and sold in </v>

149
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.420
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>

150
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

151
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to start there just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have a little bit of a sense</v>

152
00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:26.304
<v Speaker 1>of the word and don't get too hung up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it before all the commenters start </v>

153
00:07:28.711 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 1>yelling at you right out of the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

154
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.463
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to start also with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I became familiar with you was </v>

155
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.693
<v Speaker 1>right after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in</v>
<v Speaker 1>France because you were all over the </v>

156
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 1>media and I saw an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

157
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.810
<v Speaker 1>it was a discussion on Al Jazeera and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were incredibly,</v>

158
00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:53.811
<v Speaker 1>I thought lucid and clear and clean and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your explanation of why we can have no,</v>

159
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can have no give when it comes to </v>

160
00:07:58.321 --> 00:07:59.154
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought you could possibly explain </v>

161
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.064
<v Speaker 1>that for me.</v>

162
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't the best interview I've ever</v>

163
00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:10.771
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One always tries to be polite of course,</v>

164
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.230
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bit much,</v>

165
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:19.240
<v Speaker 2>but within 24 hours a of the 12 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>being shot dead in Paris,</v>

166
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.580
<v Speaker 2>the Algiers you inviting me on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to have a discussion about what</v>

167
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.960
<v Speaker 2>this would mean about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

168
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.400
<v Speaker 2>allegedly nascent European hatred of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam and Muslims and,</v>

169
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.650
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

170
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.810
<v Speaker 2>the socal backlash thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

171
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.733
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fairly furious about that because </v>

172
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:39.064
<v Speaker 2>I thought that this was obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>diverting attention from actual dead </v>

173
00:08:43.361 --> 00:08:48.361
<v Speaker 2>bodies onto a potentially hurt opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt feelings and so on.</v>

174
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.890
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyhow,</v>

175
00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:53.800
<v Speaker 2>I did actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a prerecorded for what it's worth</v>

176
00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 2>and I went back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

177
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.003
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and said to a colleague or </v>

178
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>they're never going to wear that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

179
00:08:58.651 --> 00:08:59.484
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I did at some point give the </v>

180
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.703
<v Speaker 2>interviewer who was sitting in Doha a </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of my mind about the fact that he </v>

181
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 2>seemed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

182
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 2>well he didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say when I pointed out he lived in</v>

183
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:10.614
<v Speaker 2>an unfree country and was working for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfree media and that I wasn't </v>

184
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:14.574
<v Speaker 2>answerable to him.</v>

185
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.790
<v Speaker 2>I still haven't actually got the fee for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that interview</v>

186
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.983
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

187
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not being asked back either.</v>

188
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing the check is not coming in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mail,</v>

189
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:23.814
<v Speaker 1>so I would just let that be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I liked about that though is </v>

190
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:28.520
<v Speaker 1>that you clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

191
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.770
<v Speaker 1>you called out the interviewer in Doha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really you were,</v>

192
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you were really calling out your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

193
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were calling up people in the UK and</v>

194
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:36.894
<v Speaker 1>you were calling out people in France </v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably in America and all over </v>

195
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of.</v>

196
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:40.704
<v Speaker 1>We were doing this to ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally before the bodies had been </v>

197
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:46.284
<v Speaker 1>buried.</v>

198
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

199
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

200
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.003
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was recognizing in a way when you've </v>

201
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:51.824
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've lost every round of the free </v>

202
00:09:53.901 --> 00:09:57.560
<v Speaker 2>speech wars in recent years from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>satanic verses a fair on.</v>

203
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Whereas we always sort of get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical,</v>

204
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always,</v>

205
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.040
<v Speaker 2>there's always a technical way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We allow ourselves,</v>

206
00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:04.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

207
00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm off the satanic verses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:08.630
<v Speaker 2>thank goodness someone wished you </v>
<v Speaker 2>remained alive.</v>

209
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.760
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically everybody has been.</v>

210
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.663
<v Speaker 2>Has this been often said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>internalize the fact why there's never </v>

211
00:10:13.191 --> 00:10:15.590
<v Speaker 2>been another book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the satanic verses published.</v>

212
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.570
<v Speaker 2>There probably won't be in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetimes.</v>

213
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm off to Charlene Abdo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

214
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:21.684
<v Speaker 2>people walked through the streets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paris world leaders in that sort of </v>

215
00:10:24.831 --> 00:10:25.664
<v Speaker 2>preposterous parade through Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parisians holding up pencils as if this </v>

216
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:32.984
<v Speaker 2>was an act of defiance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No inactive defiance would have been if </v>

217
00:10:34.851 --> 00:10:38.060
<v Speaker 2>everyone had marched through Paris </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding a cartoon of Muhammad,</v>

218
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.463
<v Speaker 2>the act of defiance on the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>media that was so desperately trying to </v>

219
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:46.640
<v Speaker 2>find a way to be showing alliance with </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're slaughtered colleagues.</v>

220
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.503
<v Speaker 2>The best media could do is to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeat the same weasley excuses even </v>

221
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.690
<v Speaker 2>doing for 10 years since the Danish </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoons,</v>

222
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:56.600
<v Speaker 2>the FA and try to save their dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

223
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a very undignified site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the media,</v>

224
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:00.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after all we've got,</v>

225
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.700
<v Speaker 2>remember it probably awards itself more </v>
<v Speaker 2>awards than anyone else in the world.</v>

226
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know firemen and policemen don't,</v>

227
00:11:07.641 --> 00:11:08.474
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have endless award ceremonies for </v>

228
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:12.380
<v Speaker 2>their bravery and give each other metals</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

229
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:13.880
<v Speaker 2>But journalists are doing it all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

230
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.580
<v Speaker 2>There is lots of journalistic bravery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>

231
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.420
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

232
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.253
<v Speaker 2>the reason why we keep on failing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is because actually our media as a </v>

233
00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:23.084
<v Speaker 2>whole and most individuals just don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to make the kind of standard which </v>

234
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.553
<v Speaker 2>if we'd made it 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't have to keep on going </v>

235
00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:31.304
<v Speaker 2>through today.</v>

236
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.223
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that's why people are </v>

237
00:11:33.821 --> 00:11:36.760
<v Speaker 1>responding to you the way they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to you and responding to what</v>

238
00:11:36.761 --> 00:11:37.594
<v Speaker 1>we're doing because it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems late at this point by us </v>

239
00:11:41.381 --> 00:11:45.400
<v Speaker 1>talking about free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems so late and overdue and I think</v>

240
00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:46.234
<v Speaker 1>that's why there's been this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of groundswell of support for </v>

241
00:11:49.631 --> 00:11:51.430
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you agree with that?</v>

242
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

243
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:53.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

244
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bit pessimistic about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

245
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.860
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of another satanic </v>
<v Speaker 2>verses.</v>

246
00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.300
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

247
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.483
<v Speaker 2>things could change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly seems to me that a lot </v>

248
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:03.124
<v Speaker 2>of people are increasingly aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that we live in an age of </v>

249
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:07.803
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary caladis at an age of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cowardice that masquerades as an era of </v>

250
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:13.100
<v Speaker 2>truth telling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

251
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

252
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.183
<v Speaker 2>but these things are very confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for most people when they're </v>

253
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:18.080
<v Speaker 2>living through them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

254
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just said,</v>

255
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.790
<v Speaker 2>if you just said I didn't know in 1999,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

256
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:23.723
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't see me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd see me in one of us had said to </v>

257
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:25.901
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

258
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 2>the 21st century is going to be racked </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the Western world with blasts for</v>

259
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:35.461
<v Speaker 2>me was you just thought you must be </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk or I'm at the most.</v>

260
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 2>If you believe that prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have said,</v>

261
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do the Spanish inquisition come back</v>

262
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 2>into Europe here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that occur?</v>

263
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.073
<v Speaker 2>How did I know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did the Catholic Church remains </v>

264
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 2>returned to medieval times and start </v>
<v Speaker 2>burning heretics?</v>

265
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one would have thought that in 2015 a</v>

266
00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:58.654
<v Speaker 2>newspaper offices across the world would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be debating whether they could show a </v>

267
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 2>little cartoon or some guy just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

268
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 2>just to not even have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

269
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:11.500
<v Speaker 2>not even as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate photo fit of Mohammed,</v>

270
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 2>just anything which they then say could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be called Mohammed.</v>

271
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:20.220
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have believed that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the thing that broke a,</v>

272
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the western press,</v>

273
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 2>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is.</v>

274
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:23.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was was one of the most infuriating </v>

275
00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:30.381
<v Speaker 1>parts for you that actually what Charlie</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebdo did was incredible satire,</v>

276
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.153
<v Speaker 1>making fun of all religions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I saw in that Aljazeera piece and in </v>

277
00:13:35.391 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 1>another piece where people were saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this was racism,</v>

278
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.143
<v Speaker 1>what they were doing was racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually it was the reverse of </v>

279
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:42.624
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were fighting for the principles </v>

280
00:13:44.551 --> 00:13:46.710
<v Speaker 1>that the left is supposed to believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

281
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.780
<v Speaker 2>W W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w what?</v>

282
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.693
<v Speaker 2>Let's not forget the fact that we live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in an age when everyone not only has an </v>

283
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:53.224
<v Speaker 2>opinion but is expected to have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion and most people therefore have </v>

284
00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 2>to mug up very fast on things they know </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing about.</v>

285
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.860
<v Speaker 2>So after Shawnee Abdo and January,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people were just cropping up on</v>

286
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:08.560
<v Speaker 2>things who had always said he never </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually seen a copy of Charlene.</v>

287
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I've never actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

288
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 2>read it or seen the cartoons or new </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything very much about it.</v>

289
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.113
<v Speaker 2>But one of the immediate attacks on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead journalists was of course to say </v>

290
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.310
<v Speaker 2>they were racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was probably for me,</v>

291
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:26.311
<v Speaker 2>the thing which I have to keep going </v>
<v Speaker 2>during that period.</v>

292
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:27.243
<v Speaker 2>I thought it wasn't remain under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief that it was intolerable that a </v>

293
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:32.314
<v Speaker 2>group of people could go through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>front doors of the newspaper office in </v>

294
00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:34.954
<v Speaker 2>Europe and gum people down with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kalashnikovs and then for their fellow </v>

295
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 2>travelers to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it were,</v>

296
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:41.350
<v Speaker 2>more pub afterwards by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

297
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.513
<v Speaker 2>they were kind of racist anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know much about them until 24 </v>

298
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:45.814
<v Speaker 2>hours ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll say they're racist and then </v>

299
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 2>nobody needs to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was a real low point.</v>

300
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

301
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been calling them.</v>

302
00:14:53.371 --> 00:14:54.204
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a phrase that marginalized coined </v>

303
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.620
<v Speaker 1>the regressive left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

304
00:14:58.621 --> 00:14:59.454
<v Speaker 1>and is that really where they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed us as a society more than </v>

305
00:15:03.571 --> 00:15:07.350
<v Speaker 1>anything else by this meme that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is racist.</v>

306
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Everything is based in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.893
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say anything you hate women or </v>

308
00:15:12.001 --> 00:15:13.410
<v Speaker 1>you hate gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this,</v>

309
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.273
<v Speaker 1>this idea that people on the other side </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you disagree with can't be as </v>

310
00:15:18.091 --> 00:15:18.924
<v Speaker 1>principled as you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that where the left has really </v>

311
00:15:20.671 --> 00:15:21.504
<v Speaker 1>failed?</v>

312
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.483
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want me to just start with </v>

313
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.180
<v Speaker 2>describing why the left?</v>

314
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm going to push it and then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to put you on somebody.</v>

315
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is several things.</v>

316
00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:33.864
<v Speaker 2>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because people aren't religious </v>

317
00:15:35.221 --> 00:15:36.054
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean they don't still want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought to be good by their </v>

318
00:15:37.711 --> 00:15:38.544
<v Speaker 2>contemporaries and their peers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it used to be quite straightforward </v>

319
00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.990
<v Speaker 2>to demonstrate how are you a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

320
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.830
<v Speaker 2>today we're sort of making it up on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hoof,</v>

321
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:45.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

322
00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:46.674
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to be the most frenetically </v>

323
00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:52.390
<v Speaker 2>supportive person ever of whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>latest rights issue,</v>

324
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.910
<v Speaker 2>but really the deepest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

325
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a desire of.</v>

326
00:15:56.461 --> 00:15:57.990
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it from the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just this,</v>

327
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:03.020
<v Speaker 2>whatever this movement is that being so </v>
<v Speaker 2>gripping in recent years to 70 people,</v>

328
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.423
<v Speaker 2>I think a predominant thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that people want other people to be </v>

329
00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:10.830
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want people to be racist.</v>

330
00:16:10.831 --> 00:16:11.664
<v Speaker 2>They want Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are fighting a war that was </v>

331
00:16:15.571 --> 00:16:20.571
<v Speaker 2>effectively finished consummately 70 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and they don't seem to realize</v>

332
00:16:20.851 --> 00:16:24.060
<v Speaker 2>it or they want to look as brave as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who fought narcissism,</v>

333
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.320
<v Speaker 2>but they can do it from their home on </v>
<v Speaker 2>skype or twitter or facebook.</v>

334
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.640
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

335
00:16:29.641 --> 00:16:30.060
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

336
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.893
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are in so many ways </v>

337
00:16:32.371 --> 00:16:33.204
<v Speaker 2>disappointed people because the number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Nazis around these days is quite </v>

338
00:16:37.741 --> 00:16:39.210
<v Speaker 2>small in number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thankfully.</v>

339
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

340
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.033
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a supply and demand </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem or there's an enormous demand </v>

341
00:16:44.011 --> 00:16:46.050
<v Speaker 2>for Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not much of a supply.</v>

342
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.120
<v Speaker 2>So people go scouring around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

343
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.200
<v Speaker 2>the social media is media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political landscape,</v>

344
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.303
<v Speaker 2>desperately trying to find people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can call Nazis or racists in order </v>

345
00:16:56.641 --> 00:17:00.900
<v Speaker 2>to position themselves as therefore anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist or anti Nazi.</v>

346
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.320
<v Speaker 2>These people need this because they need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to feed off it and they're great hope is</v>

347
00:17:07.021 --> 00:17:07.854
<v Speaker 2>that they can call everybody else racist</v>
<v Speaker 2>when and then be the only person </v>

348
00:17:12.661 --> 00:17:15.210
<v Speaker 2>standing who's not a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

349
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>

350
00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are not only fighting,</v>

351
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.823
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

352
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I pretty much dead battle about they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasting their lives in the process.</v>

353
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that where the,</v>

354
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:31.650
<v Speaker 1>the meme of Islamophobia has come in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>been dealt with in such a dishonest way?</v>

355
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.833
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to guess that you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue that there's no people that hate </v>

356
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

357
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 1>You agree that some people just hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims,</v>

358
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:40.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

359
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people hate all sorts of people.</v>

360
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

361
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.133
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People hate people because of their </v>

362
00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:47.870
<v Speaker 1>color or their religion or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so their sexuality,</v>

363
00:17:47.871 --> 00:17:48.704
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this idea of Islamophobia seems to </v>

364
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.004
<v Speaker 1>me that it's taken on this new thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're not allowed to hate an </v>

365
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:57.840
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not people.</v>

366
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:59.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

367
00:17:59.381 --> 00:18:00.214
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

368
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.083
<v Speaker 2>I think this is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful ways that anyone's come up </v>

369
00:18:03.821 --> 00:18:05.470
<v Speaker 2>with in recent years to shut down </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

370
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.160
<v Speaker 2>It's no surprise that the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>started off the I,</v>

371
00:18:09.161 --> 00:18:09.994
<v Speaker 2>the term Islamophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who were keenest on it from </v>

372
00:18:12.401 --> 00:18:15.700
<v Speaker 2>the outset in the 19 nineties own words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were his limits?</v>

373
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to portray themselves as the</v>

374
00:18:18.791 --> 00:18:22.390
<v Speaker 2>only defenders of Islam against these </v>
<v Speaker 2>haters.</v>

375
00:18:22.391 --> 00:18:25.630
<v Speaker 2>These people who hated all Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hated the religion.</v>

376
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.390
<v Speaker 2>It's been a trickle that's been going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time.</v>

377
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

378
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:33.800
<v Speaker 1>just to clarify that the word came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim Brotherhood,</v>

379
00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:34.634
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

380
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

381
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.353
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people realize that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it came from some think tank </v>

382
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.250
<v Speaker 1>probably in the United States.</v>

383
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.261
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

384
00:18:41.261 --> 00:18:41.720
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

385
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 2>it was just picked up by such people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

386
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.760
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when a real problem because a,</v>

387
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.210
<v Speaker 2>still most people when they hear the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cry,</v>

388
00:18:52.211 --> 00:18:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia Think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

389
00:18:53.891 --> 00:18:55.260
<v Speaker 2>this must be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

390
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.170
<v Speaker 2>some racist problem and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the problem is among other things,</v>

391
00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:04.171
<v Speaker 2>and it's scooped up any and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism of anything to do with Islam.</v>

392
00:19:04.391 --> 00:19:05.950
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means that,</v>

393
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:06.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

394
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.640
<v Speaker 2>if you come out with a criticism of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim Brotherhood,</v>

395
00:19:09.641 --> 00:19:10.510
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the group,</v>

396
00:19:10.511 --> 00:19:13.540
<v Speaker 2>which is eminently possible to criticize</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

397
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.180
<v Speaker 2>you are being Islamophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

398
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.073
<v Speaker 2>if you say you don't like something </v>
<v Speaker 2>which may well be very fundamental to </v>

399
00:19:20.741 --> 00:19:21.574
<v Speaker 2>the Islamic faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are being Islamophobic and that for </v>

400
00:19:25.181 --> 00:19:26.014
<v Speaker 2>the time being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this will change and it may </v>

401
00:19:27.971 --> 00:19:30.840
<v Speaker 2>change very fast and very nastily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

402
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:35.710
<v Speaker 2>but for the time being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia trumps most other things.</v>

403
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.270
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

404
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.191
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

405
00:19:39.191 --> 00:19:40.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be the,</v>

406
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.480
<v Speaker 2>you can be the most outspoken feminists </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your generation,</v>

407
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.880
<v Speaker 2>but if you said something that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia,</v>

408
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the time being trump,</v>

409
00:19:47.921 --> 00:19:50.590
<v Speaker 2>feminism and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gays by the way,</v>

410
00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:52.870
<v Speaker 2>go really down low in this pecking </v>
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

411
00:19:52.871 --> 00:19:54.940
<v Speaker 2>No one really cares about that,</v>

412
00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

413
00:19:56.141 --> 00:19:56.974
<v Speaker 1>people seem afraid to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that isis is literally throwing </v>

414
00:20:00.221 --> 00:20:03.850
<v Speaker 1>gays off the roofs of buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no outrage over that,</v>

415
00:20:03.851 --> 00:20:04.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

416
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.250
<v Speaker 2>It should get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should not be easier than this,</v>

417
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isis,</v>

418
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:11.840
<v Speaker 2>throw gays off buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

419
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.833
<v Speaker 2>criticize isis and what's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticize the ideology that they are </v>

420
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:17.963
<v Speaker 2>coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

421
00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:18.963
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isis poses an enormous problem because </v>

422
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Isis don't get their ideas from nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't invent them yesterday.</v>

423
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 2>They always publish along scriptural </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanations,</v>

424
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Koran and had he,</v>

425
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 2>of why they're doing what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

426
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:38.241
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that people should say</v>
<v Speaker 2>isis through the gaze of the buildings.</v>

427
00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all Muslims hate gays.</v>

428
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:41.004
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all gays or anyone else should hate </v>

429
00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Muslims obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

430
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.920
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

431
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.390
<v Speaker 2>But obviously you have to identify where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem comes from and I mean,</v>

432
00:20:48.391 --> 00:20:49.224
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look around and I find ones of people </v>

433
00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:52.340
<v Speaker 2>willing to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

434
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment,</v>

435
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:54.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just a quick one,</v>

436
00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:55.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

437
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

438
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 2>you always get reached to the National </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union of students in Britain if you want</v>

439
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:00.574
<v Speaker 2>to reach for a bunch of idiots at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>National Union of students in Britain </v>

440
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:04.720
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

441
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:05.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't condemn isis because they said </v>

442
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:11.920
<v Speaker 2>that it would be Islamophobic to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So while Isis,</v>

443
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing gays off buildings and raping </v>

444
00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:16.294
<v Speaker 2>young girls for the alleged crime of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a Yazidi or occurred or from a </v>

445
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Muslim sect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

446
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:21.750
<v Speaker 2>a group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

447
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.290
<v Speaker 2>men have a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>salacious.</v>

448
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Don't believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you criticize that,</v>

449
00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:27.840
<v Speaker 2>your Islamaphobic look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>

450
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are caught.</v>

451
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 2>They're caught in this terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

452
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mess of half thinking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonthinking and um,</v>

453
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.950
<v Speaker 2>everyone's got to find a way to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>them think their way out of it.</v>

454
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.360
<v Speaker 2>But they've been to be quite fast.</v>

455
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.650
<v Speaker 1>They better be fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fear that they're not.</v>

456
00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:44.810
<v Speaker 1>So what would you say to the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would argue,</v>

457
00:21:44.811 --> 00:21:45.644
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really created isis because we went </v>

458
00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.230
<v Speaker 1>into Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which now by most accounts was the wrong</v>

459
00:21:51.231 --> 00:21:53.750
<v Speaker 1>war to go into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if you agree with that,</v>

460
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:54.763
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then by leaving so quickly the way </v>

461
00:21:56.811 --> 00:21:58.130
<v Speaker 1>we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>

462
00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.053
<v Speaker 1>it was a breeding ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fertile ground for religious </v>

463
00:22:01.671 --> 00:22:02.504
<v Speaker 1>extremism and all of this awfulness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen so that it's not just about </v>

464
00:22:05.631 --> 00:22:07.760
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also about the geopolitics.</v>

465
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Can I make a point which doesn't always </v>
<v Speaker 2>go down well with American audiences,</v>

466
00:22:13.951 --> 00:22:16.770
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's worth pointing out as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an outsider,</v>

467
00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:17.604
<v Speaker 2>as a question because part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American thought disease on this is now </v>

468
00:22:20.941 --> 00:22:22.800
<v Speaker 2>in Europe as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it started with you.</v>

469
00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:26.460
<v Speaker 2>We give you some bad ideas and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>give us as well this,</v>

470
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.010
<v Speaker 2>this American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

471
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.933
<v Speaker 2>self obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This American idea that nothing in the </v>

472
00:22:33.001 --> 00:22:36.990
<v Speaker 2>world can get screwed up unless it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of America is a,</v>

473
00:22:36.991 --> 00:22:37.824
<v Speaker 2>an intellectual disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get over the world can go </v>

474
00:22:40.651 --> 00:22:45.180
<v Speaker 2>to hell without America doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world can go to hell without America</v>

475
00:22:45.181 --> 00:22:46.014
<v Speaker 2>lifting a finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But every time anything in the world </v>

476
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.630
<v Speaker 2>does go to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans ask themselves,</v>

477
00:22:51.631 --> 00:22:54.690
<v Speaker 2>what is it we did or didn't do that made</v>
<v Speaker 2>this happen?</v>

478
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.190
<v Speaker 2>That's why you still see the amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

479
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.070
<v Speaker 2>an example of not only the president of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>

480
00:23:02.071 --> 00:23:07.071
<v Speaker 2>but other senior figures in American </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics even wanting to apologize for,</v>

481
00:23:07.201 --> 00:23:08.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the era of the Crusades.</v>

482
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff happened centuries before,</v>

483
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the British even discovered,</v>

484
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

485
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early cities of America and so on.</v>

486
00:23:19.521 --> 00:23:20.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

487
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:21.001
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

488
00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:22.260
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this happened before,</v>

489
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.050
<v Speaker 2>before the US was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was founded.</v>

490
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.113
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep blaming yourself for things </v>

491
00:23:28.441 --> 00:23:33.441
<v Speaker 2>before the creation of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nobody is fooled apart from you.</v>

492
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:34.583
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend some years ago who went </v>
<v Speaker 2>to interview Yasser Arafat and Iranian </v>

493
00:23:38.011 --> 00:23:39.030
<v Speaker 2>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a journalist,</v>

494
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.740
<v Speaker 2>very distinguished journalists from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran.</v>

495
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.080
<v Speaker 2>And he went to interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes or I for some years ago.</v>

496
00:23:43.081 --> 00:23:44.780
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the end of the interview.</v>

497
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a knock on the door.</v>

498
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:47.534
<v Speaker 2>And one of you asked about how fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>goons or porthole or male friends or </v>

499
00:23:50.421 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 2>whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm said,</v>

500
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.383
<v Speaker 2>Chairman Arafat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American delegation is here to see </v>

501
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:56.414
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

502
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and my friend thought he had a scoop and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said to,</v>

503
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who is this American </v>
<v Speaker 2>delegation?</v>

504
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.543
<v Speaker 2>And there was a delegation that's come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the US to apologize for the </v>

505
00:24:04.641 --> 00:24:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Crusades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Arafat burst out laughing.</v>

506
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Everybody laughs at this apart from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

507
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:16.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isis was not created because of George W</v>

508
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.443
<v Speaker 2>Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

509
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

510
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.580
<v Speaker 2>al Qaeda wasn't created because of Bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton or George Hw Bush.</v>

511
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.120
<v Speaker 2>There are things that America can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>well and things that can American can do</v>

512
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:26.954
<v Speaker 2>badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are things you've done that </v>

513
00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:28.544
<v Speaker 2>haven't held.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were things that Britain has done </v>

514
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:32.870
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't helped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is not all because of you.</v>

515
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

516
00:24:34.171 --> 00:24:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I do agree we have a way of making </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything about ourselves.</v>

517
00:24:37.221 --> 00:24:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because we're a young </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy and a lot of respect.</v>

518
00:24:39.721 --> 00:24:42.440
<v Speaker 1>So we're still in our infant tile phase </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps.</v>

519
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.323
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys not have that in England?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously England has done all </v>

520
00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:49.330
<v Speaker 1>sorts of imperial things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far more far,</v>

521
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 1>far richer history of materialism than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States saying you guys,</v>

522
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.470
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't have that feeling is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist at all.</v>

523
00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.753
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain could teach America something </v>

524
00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:00.554
<v Speaker 2>about imperialism and it can teach and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he could teach America something about </v>

525
00:25:03.381 --> 00:25:05.360
<v Speaker 2>post and pivot as we've been going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

526
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 2>We've been going through this for </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades and rightly so.</v>

527
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:08.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

528
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.393
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all countries are after their </v>

529
00:25:12.141 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 2>height.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks over what it's done and wonders</v>

530
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.410
<v Speaker 2>whether it was a force for good or ill </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

531
00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 2>And we have periods where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We seem to think we did no good.</v>

532
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:23.084
<v Speaker 2>And other times when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we realize actually that on </v>

533
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:26.810
<v Speaker 2>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe things were better than that.</v>

534
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we did more good than we did harm.</v>

535
00:25:29.301 --> 00:25:32.360
<v Speaker 2>It's always in the balance that goes up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and down and perhaps so it should.</v>

536
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:36.950
<v Speaker 2>But the fascinating thing to me again </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this is it's so one sided.</v>

537
00:25:36.951 --> 00:25:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

538
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:38.953
<v Speaker 2>we hear all the time about what empires </v>
<v Speaker 2>do and about the British empire and </v>

539
00:25:42.431 --> 00:25:43.264
<v Speaker 2>about the mandate in Palestine and about</v>
<v Speaker 2>America is really quite minimal </v>

540
00:25:46.881 --> 00:25:47.714
<v Speaker 2>involvement or at least quite brief </v>
<v Speaker 2>involvement to date in the Middle East </v>

541
00:25:50.301 --> 00:25:51.080
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

542
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.530
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't we ever talk about Turkey?</v>

543
00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we ever talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most important,</v>

544
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 2>the longest and largest empires in human</v>
<v Speaker 2>history was the Ottoman Empire.</v>

545
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 2>I never hear anyone from America or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain or anyone else saying,</v>

546
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:06.404
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Turks have got so much to answer </v>

547
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.713
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever says the Turks have done so </v>

548
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:16.640
<v Speaker 2>much wrong in the Middle East and until </v>
<v Speaker 2>we punish them sufficiently,</v>

549
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.653
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only people in America and Britain </v>

550
00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:22.124
<v Speaker 2>and the rest of the west who so self </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed and I know so little history </v>

551
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:26.871
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

552
00:26:26.871 --> 00:26:27.704
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we think is we will be able to </v>

553
00:26:30.321 --> 00:26:31.154
<v Speaker 2>solve it if we beat ourselves up and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could beat ourselves up for every year </v>

554
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:35.834
<v Speaker 2>we have in the future and it still </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't solve the problems in the </v>

555
00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't solve Iraq,</v>

556
00:26:40.581 --> 00:26:42.740
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't so serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't solve Turkey,</v>

557
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:44.370
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't stop Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't do anything.</v>

558
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.413
<v Speaker 2>It's a luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a luxury that I think is a kind of </v>

559
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:49.200
<v Speaker 2>decadent luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

560
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't approve of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may have,</v>

561
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:50.830
<v Speaker 2>may have gotten,</v>

562
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:55.150
<v Speaker 1>but I think I got that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds almost like a sort of like,</v>

563
00:26:55.151 --> 00:27:00.150
<v Speaker 1>you see this as like a disease of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western mind sort of that we've,</v>

564
00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.053
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our society because of our freedoms has </v>

565
00:27:03.041 --> 00:27:03.874
<v Speaker 1>moved so far past some of these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>places that we turn everything on </v>

566
00:27:08.771 --> 00:27:09.604
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't realize sort of how good we </v>

567
00:27:10.871 --> 00:27:11.970
<v Speaker 1>have it or something to that.</v>

568
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also it's laziness.</v>

569
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.180
<v Speaker 2>It's laziness masquerading as moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophistication.</v>

570
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

571
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.970
<v Speaker 2>if you go to a dinner party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

572
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.340
<v Speaker 2>I know you went at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>

573
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.183
<v Speaker 2>this is squared for you there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you were to go to a dinner party </v>

574
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.393
<v Speaker 2>and somebody was going to see them about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and you wanted to say </v>

575
00:27:29.651 --> 00:27:31.690
<v Speaker 2>something really clever about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan,</v>

576
00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:32.524
<v Speaker 2>you would probably say something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how terrible American involvement in </v>

577
00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan has been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

578
00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.413
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you signed to any other power other </v>

579
00:27:40.181 --> 00:27:42.790
<v Speaker 2>than a western powers involvement in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan,</v>

580
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:43.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

581
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.730
<v Speaker 2>it's not so sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

582
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:46.703
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go from America or you go for </v>

583
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go for yourself,</v>

584
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

585
00:27:50.481 --> 00:27:51.400
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look like,</v>

586
00:27:51.401 --> 00:27:53.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about African history,</v>

587
00:27:53.021 --> 00:27:55.810
<v Speaker 2>which let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few people do.</v>

588
00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:57.430
<v Speaker 2>You start to look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

589
00:27:57.431 --> 00:27:58.264
<v Speaker 2>about African history and you also look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're so morally sophisticated </v>

590
00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.613
<v Speaker 2>that you can even beat up on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it means among other things is </v>

591
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.290
<v Speaker 2>you don't actually have to pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the world.</v>

592
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.363
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to go anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to really think about </v>

593
00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:12.850
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't really have to keep up to date</v>

594
00:28:12.851 --> 00:28:14.860
<v Speaker 2>because every time anything happens you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can say,</v>

595
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:17.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was that time and you know,</v>

596
00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:17.950
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

597
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:18.783
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

598
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.360
<v Speaker 2>and just come up with some date and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hey,</v>

599
00:28:22.361 --> 00:28:23.194
<v Speaker 2>presto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you walk away looking like you know </v>

600
00:28:25.091 --> 00:28:26.740
<v Speaker 2>something and looking like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>

601
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

602
00:28:27.441 --> 00:28:28.274
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of it sort of through </v>

603
00:28:29.421 --> 00:28:31.460
<v Speaker 1>the prism that you're presenting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

604
00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:32.294
<v Speaker 1>but I think Turkey is a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting example of this because if </v>

605
00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1974,</v>

606
00:28:36.921 --> 00:28:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Turkey's been in occupation of half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cypress,</v>

607
00:28:40.341 --> 00:28:41.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that,</v>

608
00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.060
<v Speaker 1>isn't this an occupation of a sovereign </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation?</v>

609
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.980
<v Speaker 2>You still have one of my most salient </v>
<v Speaker 2>important points I should have gotten.</v>

610
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You all right?</v>

611
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:52.700
<v Speaker 1>So I just tossed it up for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take it away.</v>

612
00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cypress is,</v>

613
00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.060
<v Speaker 2>is the most startling example of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:58.983
<v Speaker 2>Turkey is a member of NATO and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>an occupation of part of a European </v>

615
00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:04.850
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

616
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.110
<v Speaker 2>and I never hear anyone talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

617
00:29:08.111 --> 00:29:08.944
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

618
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.790
<v Speaker 2>unless you have Cypriot friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one ever raises Cyprus at dinner.</v>

619
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:13.883
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever anyone's got a placard on the </v>

620
00:29:15.281 --> 00:29:17.800
<v Speaker 2>street marching up and down and in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupation,</v>

621
00:29:17.801 --> 00:29:22.120
<v Speaker 2>they never talking about Cypress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one ever raises it.</v>

622
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

623
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't care and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

624
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.250
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm in it.</v>

625
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:30.084
<v Speaker 2>It's these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only point these things out and </v>

626
00:29:32.201 --> 00:29:36.610
<v Speaker 2>hope that over time that trickle down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this information gets somewhere,</v>

627
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as I say,</v>

628
00:29:38.321 --> 00:29:39.154
<v Speaker 2>in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have got a very narrow set of </v>

629
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 2>facts and the easiest way out is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's our fault.</v>

630
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to delve a little more into,</v>

631
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.083
<v Speaker 1>into Israel and Palestine and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperialism and how it all happen and </v>

632
00:29:55.671 --> 00:29:56.730
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People never talked that.</v>

633
00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:57.643
<v Speaker 1>It all started with the Ottoman empire </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the British empire and the </v>

634
00:30:00.651 --> 00:30:02.690
<v Speaker 1>mandate and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we get to that,</v>

635
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:03.703
<v Speaker 1>let's just do a little bit quick on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Syria right now because it seems to </v>

636
00:30:06.801 --> 00:30:10.190
<v Speaker 1>me by every estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no longer a country under any,</v>

637
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.060
<v Speaker 1>under any circumstances that we consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>a functioning country.</v>

638
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:15.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that we're at this </v>

639
00:30:16.731 --> 00:30:17.564
<v Speaker 1>point also basically just in a proxy war</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the United States pretty much in a </v>

640
00:30:20.691 --> 00:30:21.524
<v Speaker 1>proxy war with Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my completely oversimplifying it at </v>

641
00:30:24.861 --> 00:30:25.694
<v Speaker 1>this point.</v>

642
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:26.563
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not quite approximate war with </v>

643
00:30:29.591 --> 00:30:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something else.</v>

644
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.380
<v Speaker 2>The truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that Syria is the end of Syria,</v>

645
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.230
<v Speaker 2>the end game in this area as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think we probably are in now,</v>

646
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.850
<v Speaker 2>is the end game that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Iranians always wanted,</v>

647
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.300
<v Speaker 2>which is assigned against Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

648
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.163
<v Speaker 2>because if it's a sad against Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know that the world will not back </v>

649
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

650
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.733
<v Speaker 2>earlier this year I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was interviewed by Jeremy Button at the </v>

651
00:30:58.181 --> 00:30:59.820
<v Speaker 2>BBC and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

652
00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:01.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks about the opposition as these </v>

653
00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:03.820
<v Speaker 2>terrorists of Isis and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

654
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.313
<v Speaker 2>some years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have been able to get away </v>

655
00:31:06.401 --> 00:31:08.980
<v Speaker 2>with that so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She still can't completely get away with</v>

656
00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:11.530
<v Speaker 2>that line now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some years ago,</v>

657
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:12.364
<v Speaker 2>he certainly couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew and worked with some members of </v>

658
00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Syrian opposition more than 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

659
00:31:18.131 --> 00:31:18.964
<v Speaker 2>I think to begin with and know and knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there were people who were very </v>

660
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:23.854
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wanted their country not to be run </v>

661
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:30.361
<v Speaker 2>by the Bashar Al Assad family forever </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wanted Syria to be the great country</v>

662
00:31:31.341 --> 00:31:32.350
<v Speaker 2>it could be.</v>

663
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

664
00:31:33.821 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 2>all of our hopes have gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of those people are dead now.</v>

665
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.950
<v Speaker 2>And side has got what he wanted and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iranians have got what they wanted.</v>

666
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.160
<v Speaker 2>No one will bag isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite rightly so in the end,</v>

667
00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:50.161
<v Speaker 2>will allow us to remain in power a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is to some extent,</v>

668
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:51.723
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

669
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:57.010
<v Speaker 2>what happened is when we don't take any </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest and don't really get involved,</v>

670
00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.153
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been against us intervening </v>

671
00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:03.580
<v Speaker 2>in any major way in Syria for one reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>in particular,</v>

672
00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:05.240
<v Speaker 2>which was that I always said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

673
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.153
<v Speaker 2>after Iraq and Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should realize that we clearly don't </v>

674
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:10.444
<v Speaker 2>have the desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the willpower or produce the people </v>

675
00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:16.540
<v Speaker 2>anymore in your country or mine who want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to spend,</v>

676
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 or 30 years in this country governing</v>

677
00:32:20.531 --> 00:32:23.060
<v Speaker 2>bits of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping with infrastructure problems,</v>

678
00:32:23.061 --> 00:32:23.894
<v Speaker 2>with anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're good at going in and doing the </v>

679
00:32:26.531 --> 00:32:27.364
<v Speaker 2>first phase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're no good at the follow up and </v>

680
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 2>we should realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the meantime,</v>

681
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.413
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not be responsible for any country's </v>

682
00:32:34.181 --> 00:32:35.014
<v Speaker 2>collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The WHO's who's nation building </v>

683
00:32:37.391 --> 00:32:39.260
<v Speaker 2>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really don't want to do.</v>

684
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.083
<v Speaker 1>So you're not a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>neoconservative that I think because </v>

685
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:45.670
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because wouldn't all the people that are</v>

686
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 1>going to label you neoconservative would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you should be for all these things.</v>

687
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.433
<v Speaker 2>Will it be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will he do the labels never listened to </v>

688
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:52.930
<v Speaker 2>to actually say,</v>

689
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.781
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

690
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:55.320
<v Speaker 1>what should we do then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

691
00:32:55.321 --> 00:32:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without really belaboring Syria,</v>

692
00:32:57.181 --> 00:32:59.220
<v Speaker 1>because I know we could talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for two hours.</v>

693
00:32:59.221 --> 00:33:01.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point watching this country just</v>

694
00:33:01.891 --> 00:33:05.270
<v Speaker 1>collapse and Russia filled the vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should the role of the West v?</v>

695
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we have much of a role now</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>

696
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:09.420
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

697
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.560
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for backing would go guys,</v>

698
00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.460
<v Speaker 2>the window closed very early in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

699
00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is,</v>

700
00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:21.200
<v Speaker 2>is that the future of Syria is not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be an American hands.</v>

701
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:22.034
<v Speaker 2>It probably never was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not and never was going </v>

702
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 2>to be in British hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran will win in Syria.</v>

703
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.383
<v Speaker 2>Russia will win in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bashar Al Assad will win in Syria and </v>

704
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:33.494
<v Speaker 2>everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including most of the Syrian people </v>

705
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:36.740
<v Speaker 2>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the end game.</v>

706
00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:37.574
<v Speaker 2>That's the result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much would you like it or not like </v>

707
00:33:39.681 --> 00:33:40.550
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the result.</v>

708
00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:41.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:33:41.451 --> 00:33:43.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically agree with you on that.</v>

710
00:33:43.281 --> 00:33:47.210
<v Speaker 1>How much of this do you think is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very obvious that,</v>

711
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.200
<v Speaker 1>that Obama just wanted out of this part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

712
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.213
<v Speaker 1>He just simply wanted out and the way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>left Iraq and everything else I was </v>

713
00:33:55.941 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was against,</v>

714
00:33:56.811 --> 00:33:58.660
<v Speaker 1>that's going into Libya was against </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

715
00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff.</v>

716
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.100
<v Speaker 1>But to your earlier point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like even if we do something,</v>

717
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 1>everyone hates us and if we don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

718
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 1>everyone hates us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the ultimate irony here?</v>

719
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an irony.</v>

720
00:34:11.431 --> 00:34:13.740
<v Speaker 2>There are many others as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

721
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:14.401
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

722
00:34:14.401 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is true that when America </v>
<v Speaker 2>rack,</v>

723
00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:17.183
<v Speaker 2>so it gets blamed on when it doesn't act</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get blamed and sometimes that blame </v>

724
00:34:20.401 --> 00:34:21.120
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

725
00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.890
<v Speaker 2>is worth listening to and sometimes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't.</v>

726
00:34:22.891 --> 00:34:23.724
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some extent and how you have to </v>

727
00:34:24.481 --> 00:34:26.370
<v Speaker 2>listen to who it comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

728
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

729
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people who criticize America or her</v>

730
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.810
<v Speaker 2>allies or country like Britain do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

731
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as helpful critiques,</v>

732
00:34:35.881 --> 00:34:36.714
<v Speaker 2>you can usually tell and when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticize America or Britain or any </v>

733
00:34:40.951 --> 00:34:42.570
<v Speaker 2>other country and they're speaking as </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies,</v>

734
00:34:42.571 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 2>you can also tend to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

735
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

736
00:34:47.071 --> 00:34:50.250
<v Speaker 2>that there are lots of things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can learn from this period.</v>

737
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.113
<v Speaker 2>I would think it would be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>regrettable if America decided that the </v>

738
00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.930
<v Speaker 2>response to all of this will be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>America will decide,</v>

739
00:34:57.931 --> 00:34:58.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

740
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.050
<v Speaker 2>no one ever loved us anyway.</v>

741
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.470
<v Speaker 2>So we're going home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

742
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.450
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have America to kick around</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

743
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Sort of lap is a Jeb Bush like line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

744
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.353
<v Speaker 2>I hope that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that America doesn't take that </v>

745
00:35:10.261 --> 00:35:11.094
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

746
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.063
<v Speaker 2>Obama as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I hope everyone also learns the </v>

747
00:35:14.191 --> 00:35:15.660
<v Speaker 2>lesson of Obama on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

748
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.840
<v Speaker 2>bomb his predecessor and he found all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of ways,</v>

749
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.713
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

750
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:20.693
<v Speaker 2>to mark up the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Obama has as well how many new ways </v>

751
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:23.750
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

752
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:24.780
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways,</v>

753
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

754
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.090
<v Speaker 2>a bomb was meant to be the president </v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

755
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:27.953
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who brought the troops home and brought </v>

756
00:35:28.921 --> 00:35:31.050
<v Speaker 2>peace in the Middle East and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

757
00:35:31.051 --> 00:35:31.884
<v Speaker 2>he did a bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he certainly hasn't brought peace </v>

758
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.910
<v Speaker 2>anymore than the waters receded and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that other stuff.</v>

759
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 2>And it's been a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

760
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.180
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Obama presidency,</v>

761
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:40.163
<v Speaker 2>the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will realize not that his </v>

762
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:45.690
<v Speaker 2>predecessors were terrific and that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't or anything but that,</v>

763
00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:48.900
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the noblest aspirations,</v>

764
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can all go wrong in wholly different </v>

765
00:35:52.381 --> 00:35:53.214
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

766
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that Egypt speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speech he gave in Cairo,</v>

767
00:35:56.981 --> 00:35:57.814
<v Speaker 1>which really was the reset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't that seem like not just a </v>

768
00:36:00.551 --> 00:36:01.384
<v Speaker 1>different time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost feels like it was from a </v>

769
00:36:02.201 --> 00:36:04.210
<v Speaker 1>different planet at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

770
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:05.090
<v Speaker 2>As,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

771
00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:08.570
<v Speaker 2>as did the Russia reset and as does the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia reset now,</v>

772
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after 9:11,</v>

773
00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Dick Armitage.</v>

774
00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.180
<v Speaker 2>A famously said to the Pakistani </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambassador who was saying,</v>

775
00:36:17.181 --> 00:36:18.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

776
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.090
<v Speaker 2>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no new usual guff about,</v>

777
00:36:20.091 --> 00:36:22.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when an Isi and so on,</v>

778
00:36:22.491 --> 00:36:24.860
<v Speaker 2>don't know who we know about our cage </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this sort of stuff.</v>

779
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:25.983
<v Speaker 2>Dig On.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A teacher said to a bang the table and </v>

780
00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.900
<v Speaker 2>when the Pakistani ambassador said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

781
00:36:29.901 --> 00:36:33.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of history and you said to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bang the table and say,</v>

782
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.590
<v Speaker 2>history stops today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very noble a,</v>

783
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.140
<v Speaker 2>a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's never true.</v>

784
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>history didn't start a,</v>

785
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.471
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11.</v>

786
00:36:42.471 --> 00:36:47.300
<v Speaker 2>It didn't start with the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first Obama administration.</v>

787
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:52.090
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish we were wiser about this anyhow.</v>

788
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.833
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in a world of twitter and vine </v>

789
00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:58.140
<v Speaker 1>and short videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our attention span just is afraid to the</v>

790
00:36:58.141 --> 00:36:58.974
<v Speaker 1>point that people just forget history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just don't really care about </v>

791
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:02.784
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one more quick thing on Syria and </v>

792
00:37:03.571 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 1>then we'll move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The refugee situation in Europe,</v>

793
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.620
<v Speaker 1>which I'm seeing these videos every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of all sorts of different you</v>

794
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 1>from Denmark and Sweden and Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

795
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:16.230
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like an absolutely terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

796
00:37:16.231 --> 00:37:17.064
<v Speaker 1>And what I think is most interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it is nobody had heard about any </v>

797
00:37:19.711 --> 00:37:21.300
<v Speaker 1>of it a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

798
00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:23.070
<v Speaker 1>it basically started a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe five,</v>

799
00:37:23.071 --> 00:37:23.904
<v Speaker 1>six weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that before that it </v>

800
00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:26.034
<v Speaker 1>seemed like there was no refugee crisis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it seems like an epic refugee </v>

801
00:37:29.731 --> 00:37:30.564
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

802
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

803
00:37:31.931 --> 00:37:34.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks at that from that.</v>

804
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 1>That's at least what we were getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream here.</v>

805
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

806
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.750
<v Speaker 2>in Britain and of course you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean certainly southern job,</v>

807
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.910
<v Speaker 2>it's been going on for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously a and southern Europeans,</v>

808
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:45.744
<v Speaker 2>the Italians and the Greeks in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular and asking for help for a </v>

809
00:37:47.541 --> 00:37:49.940
<v Speaker 2>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you go,</v>

810
00:37:49.941 --> 00:37:54.230
<v Speaker 2>as I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a producer in south of Italy.</v>

811
00:37:54.231 --> 00:37:57.530
<v Speaker 2>It's nearer to Libya than it is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else in it.</v>

812
00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Thinking Sicily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

813
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:59.803
<v Speaker 2>you didn't see the graves of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of migrants who tried to get over going </v>

814
00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:05.590
<v Speaker 2>back 15 years or more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

815
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.780
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is quite long developing story.</v>

816
00:38:08.781 --> 00:38:09.614
<v Speaker 2>It's true that every year in recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>years when you get towards the summer </v>

817
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.300
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a surge.</v>

818
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's easier to cross the </v>
<v Speaker 2>waters during those months.</v>

819
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.590
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

820
00:38:18.591 --> 00:38:19.424
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is such a hugely complex story and </v>

821
00:38:22.161 --> 00:38:23.840
<v Speaker 2>it's one that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

822
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:24.703
<v Speaker 2>we're all getting wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a classic example of the sort of </v>

823
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.430
<v Speaker 2>twitter age not being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being really fit for purpose,</v>

824
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.593
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is one of the most </v>

825
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.823
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary and vast and migrations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've seen and it's being </v>

826
00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:42.280
<v Speaker 2>misunderstood by almost everybody.</v>

827
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.473
<v Speaker 2>The majority of the migrants who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming into Europe and not from Syria </v>

828
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.870
<v Speaker 2>for the Syrians comprise of a minority </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the migrants.</v>

829
00:38:49.871 --> 00:38:50.704
<v Speaker 2>You can pick your presenters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people think is a narrow and 20 </v>

830
00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:53.524
<v Speaker 2>percent some people up to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It varies obviously between the points </v>

831
00:38:57.071 --> 00:38:58.600
<v Speaker 2>of entry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

832
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

833
00:38:59.591 --> 00:39:02.590
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority are coming from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world.</v>

834
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 2>So people from Bangladesh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people from coming from a,</v>

835
00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the farther east than that,</v>

836
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 2>there are people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The majority,</v>

837
00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I would think by my mo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own observation,</v>

838
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from a sub Sahara in Africa.</v>

839
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:20.050
<v Speaker 2>And so when you hear statesman a saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pundits and others saying,</v>

840
00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:20.884
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

841
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 2>we need to solve Syria for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll solve the migrant crisis.</v>

842
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:27.520
<v Speaker 2>These people don't know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

843
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.790
<v Speaker 2>even if it was in America or Britain or </v>
<v Speaker 2>any other countries,</v>

844
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.653
<v Speaker 2>gift to solve the humanitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe of Syria that would only </v>

845
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 2>solve a part of the migraine crises.</v>

846
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your plan for Eritrea?</v>

847
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Has Anyone got one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has Anyone fortive one?</v>

848
00:39:42.611 --> 00:39:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Can anyone point to Eritrea or on a map?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

849
00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are so not fit for purpose in rising </v>

850
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:52.060
<v Speaker 2>to this challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all that can happen.</v>

851
00:39:52.061 --> 00:39:54.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you having to lower the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tone somewhat.</v>

852
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Benedict cumberbatch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

853
00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:56.443
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my compatriots was on stage in </v>

854
00:39:58.541 --> 00:39:59.374
<v Speaker 2>London the other night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finished a performance of hamlet and </v>

855
00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:02.254
<v Speaker 2>berated the crowd and berated British </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians for not bringing in enough </v>

856
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the clever,</v>

857
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 2>a caring thing to say at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must open our doors.</v>

858
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Refugees welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

859
00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:15.423
<v Speaker 2>In the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recent poll showed only seven percent </v>

860
00:40:17.741 --> 00:40:22.741
<v Speaker 2>of the British people wanted immigration</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the UK to increase seven percent.</v>

861
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.063
<v Speaker 2>It's the same across Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't mind accepting genuine </v>

862
00:40:27.431 --> 00:40:28.264
<v Speaker 2>refugees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no one knows what to do with a </v>

863
00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:31.294
<v Speaker 2>number of refugees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine refugees who are coming and </v>

864
00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.413
<v Speaker 2>absolutely nobody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Chancellor Merkel who having </v>

865
00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:38.230
<v Speaker 2>saved Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

866
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:43.000
<v Speaker 2>in the financial crisis has now totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>floundered on the refugee crisis.</v>

867
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:44.830
<v Speaker 2>And Angela Merkel doesn't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

868
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:45.843
<v Speaker 2>The European Commission just recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to force quotas on European </v>

869
00:40:49.631 --> 00:40:53.200
<v Speaker 2>countries to take migrants they couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>and didn't want to take.</v>

870
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:58.360
<v Speaker 2>And as the European Commission issued </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they admitted that that number they</v>

871
00:40:58.361 --> 00:40:59.194
<v Speaker 2>were talking about was not fit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose because the number was so much </v>

872
00:41:01.721 --> 00:41:03.640
<v Speaker 2>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm trying to convey,</v>

873
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:09.070
<v Speaker 2>this is a continent wide catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we are at the beginning of.</v>

874
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:10.980
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

875
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:11.833
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't even begun to rise to it and </v>

876
00:41:13.841 --> 00:41:16.210
<v Speaker 2>we're going to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think terrible things.</v>

877
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.330
<v Speaker 2>A winter's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

878
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.173
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden is now putting refugees intense </v>

879
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:24.220
<v Speaker 2>because it's run out of properties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden took the view.</v>

880
00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:24.851
<v Speaker 2>Let's let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>

881
00:41:24.851 --> 00:41:26.710
<v Speaker 2>let's show the world how generous we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

882
00:41:26.711 --> 00:41:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said a humanitarian superpower.</v>

883
00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Now they're going to have to raise </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>

884
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:33.303
<v Speaker 2>They've got increasing public opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>against them and the top party in the </v>

885
00:41:36.471 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 2>polls in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the humanitarian,</v>

886
00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.533
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

887
00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

888
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:45.670
<v Speaker 2>hyper power of Sweden is the party of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the January called far right now,</v>

889
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.310
<v Speaker 2>top of the polls in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to see that everywhere.</v>

890
00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

891
00:41:50.171 --> 00:41:51.004
<v Speaker 1>is that what's coming next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that is what I feared that I </v>

892
00:41:52.811 --> 00:41:55.090
<v Speaker 1>think somebody like Bender Benedict </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cumberbatch,</v>

893
00:41:55.091 --> 00:41:55.924
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some well intended </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentioned humanistic thing going on </v>

894
00:41:59.561 --> 00:42:00.850
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

895
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.570
<v Speaker 2>well I don't know about that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe,</v>

896
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.510
<v Speaker 2>maybe they just want to look like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing that,</v>

897
00:42:05.511 --> 00:42:06.740
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>

898
00:42:06.741 --> 00:42:10.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes back to a really a core mistake</v>

899
00:42:10.051 --> 00:42:11.790
<v Speaker 2>or error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be generous,</v>

900
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:12.653
<v Speaker 2>be generous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't demand other people to be </v>

901
00:42:15.181 --> 00:42:17.330
<v Speaker 2>generous for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

902
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.730
<v Speaker 2>the head of the Scottish nationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>party a little while ago since she would</v>

903
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.600
<v Speaker 2>be willing to take in a Syrian family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's months since she said that.</v>

904
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.450
<v Speaker 2>And as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no Syrians living with her.</v>

905
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.593
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the top members of the Labour </v>

906
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.550
<v Speaker 2>party said the same thing months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So far as I know,</v>

907
00:42:32.551 --> 00:42:34.650
<v Speaker 2>she hasn't got a Syrian family in her </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

908
00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is posturing and it really,</v>

909
00:42:37.981 --> 00:42:40.890
<v Speaker 2>it's not sincere because if you said to </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>

910
00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:45.810
<v Speaker 2>look for numbers that are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming and look at the numbers of people</v>

911
00:42:45.811 --> 00:42:46.644
<v Speaker 2>who say they want to come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will realize that it is not only </v>

912
00:42:50.191 --> 00:42:53.610
<v Speaker 2>economically but societaly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unsustainable.</v>

913
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.550
<v Speaker 2>So you would have to realize that</v>

914
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So under the best of circumstances,</v>

915
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.260
<v Speaker 1>bringing these people in would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely difficult.</v>

916
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.153
<v Speaker 1>And basically what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing this or this is being done </v>

917
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.850
<v Speaker 1>under the worst of circumstances because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just simply no controls here.</v>

918
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no good.</v>

919
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:13.383
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't nobody knows who's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people destroy their papers before </v>

920
00:43:15.671 --> 00:43:18.150
<v Speaker 2>they get here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people pretend to be a,</v>

921
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.740
<v Speaker 2>a Syrians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when they're very obviously not.</v>

922
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

923
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.843
<v Speaker 2>and the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I've seen in covering this story in </v>

924
00:43:26.081 --> 00:43:28.270
<v Speaker 2>the south of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is,</v>

925
00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:30.780
<v Speaker 2>is that once you're in European waters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

926
00:43:30.781 --> 00:43:33.460
<v Speaker 2>your in Europe and you never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never go back.</v>

927
00:43:33.461 --> 00:43:34.570
<v Speaker 2>There is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

928
00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.830
<v Speaker 2>there's no particularly good way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when this was a low point,</v>

929
00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.650
<v Speaker 2>there was no particularly sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to work out who was,</v>

930
00:43:41.651 --> 00:43:42.484
<v Speaker 2>who and to work out who was genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was an economic migrant and that's </v>

931
00:43:46.211 --> 00:43:48.820
<v Speaker 2>whole system is basically broken down </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

932
00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:52.090
<v Speaker 2>So once you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in and uh,</v>

933
00:43:52.091 --> 00:43:54.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is going to,</v>

934
00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:55.563
<v Speaker 2>it's going to obviously approve a </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially breaking challenge for </v>

935
00:43:58.781 --> 00:44:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Europe because these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

936
00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:01.943
<v Speaker 2>the owner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany is meant to be bringing one </v>

937
00:44:03.071 --> 00:44:08.020
<v Speaker 2>percent of its population in addition </v>
<v Speaker 2>every year for the foreseeable future.</v>

938
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Who pays for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Pays for those people?</v>

939
00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

940
00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:13.413
<v Speaker 2>I'm not heartless about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see everywhere genuine </v>

941
00:44:16.511 --> 00:44:17.344
<v Speaker 2>refugees get asylum in countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully return to their countries and </v>

942
00:44:20.561 --> 00:44:22.360
<v Speaker 2>help rebuild them when they're safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

943
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:25.240
<v Speaker 2>But I would like genuine asylum seekers </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get assigned.</v>

944
00:44:25.241 --> 00:44:26.074
<v Speaker 2>But the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is so tied up that </v>

945
00:44:28.481 --> 00:44:29.314
<v Speaker 2>actually I think Europe's heart is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to harden towards all of these people </v>

946
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.930
<v Speaker 2>and in that lack of attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>detail,</v>

947
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:37.764
<v Speaker 2>I think yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across Europe we see a catastrophe </v>

948
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:40.250
<v Speaker 2>starting.</v>

949
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the Gulf countries?</v>

950
00:44:42.561 --> 00:44:43.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kuwait,</v>

951
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>united,</v>

952
00:44:44.661 --> 00:44:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Arab Emirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

953
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:46.933
<v Speaker 1>I read this morning that the six main </v>
<v Speaker 1>gulf countries have taken in zero </v>

954
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.930
<v Speaker 1>refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are theIr brothers,</v>

955
00:44:53.931 --> 00:44:54.741
<v Speaker 1>are they not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

956
00:44:54.741 --> 00:44:55.790
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here,</v>

957
00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.040
<v Speaker 2>brothers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the same way that the,</v>

958
00:44:58.041 --> 00:44:59.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>palestinians have their brothers.</v>

959
00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.790
<v Speaker 2>We'll get to that next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

960
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:02.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

961
00:45:02.811 --> 00:45:07.811
<v Speaker 2>look at the gulf state countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing no syrian refugees.</v>

962
00:45:08.271 --> 00:45:10.820
<v Speaker 2>And one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one kuwaiti official,</v>

963
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:12.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

964
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.130
<v Speaker 2>rina recent interview was asked why and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

965
00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an interview in arabic.</v>

966
00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.660
<v Speaker 2>It's on the net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

967
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:20.490
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

968
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:23.510
<v Speaker 2>that the reason was because a qa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to understand,</v>

969
00:45:23.511 --> 00:45:27.220
<v Speaker 2>he said that we are very fragile island </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

970
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:29.880
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't take in all these people.</v>

971
00:45:29.881 --> 00:45:32.630
<v Speaker 2>They are traumatized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come from a different culture.</v>

972
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different culture.</v>

973
00:45:34.461 --> 00:45:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't put up with them in the gulf as</v>

974
00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:40.220
<v Speaker 2>much more like Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you go to Norway,</v>

975
00:45:40.221 --> 00:45:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

976
00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:43.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so now,</v>

977
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:43.873
<v Speaker 2>and you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another thing of people's good </v>

978
00:45:45.681 --> 00:45:48.770
<v Speaker 2>instincts being used against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>european is here.</v>

979
00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What european see is catastrophe,</v>

980
00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.730
<v Speaker 2>what did we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must be responsible.</v>

981
00:45:55.731 --> 00:45:58.190
<v Speaker 2>What's our responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must do this.</v>

982
00:45:58.191 --> 00:46:02.000
<v Speaker 2>We must do it even if it breaks us and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over in the gulf,</v>

983
00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:06.800
<v Speaker 2>taking in zero people and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>give a damn about it.</v>

984
00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:07.903
<v Speaker 2>And frankly I think they probably find </v>
<v Speaker 2>it quite funny that the europeans have </v>

985
00:46:11.271 --> 00:46:13.580
<v Speaker 2>fallen for the idea that this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe,</v>

986
00:46:13.581 --> 00:46:15.110
<v Speaker 2>it's the fault of the europeans.</v>

987
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

988
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.920
<v Speaker 1>So I do want to move on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to backup for a second.</v>

989
00:46:17.921 --> 00:46:21.040
<v Speaker 1>So what are you thinking in the mind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like angela merkel?</v>

990
00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.530
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's actually thinking.</v>

991
00:46:23.531 --> 00:46:26.620
<v Speaker 1>She has to know that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable.</v>

992
00:46:26.621 --> 00:46:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I get it.</v>

993
00:46:27.671 --> 00:46:28.504
<v Speaker 1>She's either trying to have these lofty </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals of trying to do something on </v>

994
00:46:32.411 --> 00:46:33.244
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian grounds or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think really is going on in </v>

995
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.410
<v Speaker 1>her head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also knowing that,</v>

996
00:46:38.411 --> 00:46:41.350
<v Speaker 1>as you said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this probably is going to strengthen the</v>

997
00:46:41.351 --> 00:46:42.550
<v Speaker 1>far right in Germany.</v>

998
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

999
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:44.541
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

1000
00:46:44.541 --> 00:46:47.390
<v Speaker 2>it may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may not actually be possible to solve</v>

1001
00:46:47.391 --> 00:46:52.391
<v Speaker 2>it because in Germany for all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious historical reasons,</v>

1002
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1003
00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.120
<v Speaker 2>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say in britain,</v>

1004
00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.441
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1005
00:46:57.441 --> 00:47:00.800
<v Speaker 2>we might have a migration so large that </v>
<v Speaker 2>a british culture,</v>

1006
00:47:00.801 --> 00:47:03.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's a cycle basically over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were to say that if you've always</v>

1007
00:47:03.831 --> 00:47:04.664
<v Speaker 2>not true at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean if somewhere down the road </v>

1008
00:47:06.021 --> 00:47:06.854
<v Speaker 2>you were to say that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would still get most british people </v>

1009
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.160
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1010
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.373
<v Speaker 2>we're nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We enjoying ourselves a country where </v>

1011
00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:14.900
<v Speaker 2>we've been broadly a force for good in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1012
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:18.650
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't want britain to be over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany has a different thing.</v>

1013
00:47:18.651 --> 00:47:19.484
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of people in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a who for historical reasons and some </v>

1014
00:47:22.941 --> 00:47:23.774
<v Speaker 2>understandable historical reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically think that german guilt can </v>

1015
00:47:26.721 --> 00:47:27.554
<v Speaker 2>never be alleviated and the anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>other than the destruction of Germany </v>

1016
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:34.930
<v Speaker 2>could never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never rid Germany of its sins.</v>

1017
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.093
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own view is that those people may be </v>

1018
00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:40.630
<v Speaker 2>in the years ahead themselves in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minority.</v>

1019
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.793
<v Speaker 2>I think it's quite hard to tell young </v>
<v Speaker 2>germans that because of something their </v>

1020
00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:45.244
<v Speaker 2>grandparents did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to abolish themselves as a </v>

1021
00:47:47.411 --> 00:47:48.244
<v Speaker 2>country or as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've definitely got the problem </v>

1022
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:51.334
<v Speaker 2>harder nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see that in angela merkel's </v>

1023
00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:54.214
<v Speaker 2>response angle America when she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked recently at the press conference </v>

1024
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:59.620
<v Speaker 2>by nice german lady who just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1025
00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:00.454
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't this,</v>

1026
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 2>isn't this a problem for our country?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I am concerned for my country.</v>

1027
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I was just brushed off by anglo marco as</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this woman was some wacko weirdo.</v>

1028
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:14.110
<v Speaker 2>It who'd come from recess deville.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see this all throughout.</v>

1029
00:48:14.111 --> 00:48:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you one other very quick </v>
<v Speaker 2>example of their least paquita protests,</v>

1030
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:20.070
<v Speaker 2>which I don't aGree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1031
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned about them.</v>

1032
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that they are,</v>

1033
00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.093
<v Speaker 2>there are all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are obviously an anti islam </v>

1034
00:48:27.221 --> 00:48:29.150
<v Speaker 2>protests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will spend 90 migration process and</v>

1035
00:48:29.151 --> 00:48:32.140
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a legitimate,</v>

1036
00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:33.383
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to be with time as legitimate </v>

1037
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.430
<v Speaker 2>political grievance and needs to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to have an eric angle,</v>

1038
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.273
<v Speaker 2>merkel users her new year message to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the piggy to protesters have a </v>

1039
00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:44.913
<v Speaker 2>coldness in their hearts if instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that she had said the islamists who the </v>

1040
00:48:49.571 --> 00:48:50.404
<v Speaker 2>buggy to protests are mainly concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>about have coldness in their hearts and </v>

1041
00:48:53.261 --> 00:48:54.094
<v Speaker 2>we as germans must be careful not in </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to this hatred to become </v>

1042
00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.650
<v Speaker 2>hateful ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that might be something.</v>

1043
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:00.484
<v Speaker 2>But because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>angela merkel's problem is she can only </v>

1044
00:49:02.681 --> 00:49:05.790
<v Speaker 2>deal with secondary problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can't deal with the primary ones.</v>

1045
00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:06.371
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>

1046
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:08.050
<v Speaker 2>I said that will be a final,</v>
<v Speaker 2>final,</v>

1047
00:49:08.051 --> 00:49:08.884
<v Speaker 2>final point.</v>

1048
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.133
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other week a fascinating thing </v>

1049
00:49:11.831 --> 00:49:12.664
<v Speaker 2>happened at the un in New York angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merkel was sitting next to mark </v>

1050
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:17.290
<v Speaker 2>zuckerberg for lunch and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1051
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:18.420
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1052
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:22.810
<v Speaker 2>angela merkel's microphone was hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in politics and how the hot mic</v>

1053
00:49:22.811 --> 00:49:24.710
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how mike was still on it.</v>

1054
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Possibly the worst moment of could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

1055
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm amazed it hasn't been picked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

1056
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:29.403
<v Speaker 2>but she sat down to lunch beside mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>zuckerberg in september in New York and </v>

1057
00:49:32.171 --> 00:49:34.170
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whilst the mic was on tomorrow,</v>

1058
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.043
<v Speaker 2>looking at what can we do to stop people</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing anti-immigration things on </v>

1059
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and mark zuckerberg says,</v>

1060
00:49:41.501 --> 00:49:43.330
<v Speaker 2>we're working on it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1061
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:44.403
<v Speaker 2>I say This just as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to create a volcano in </v>

1062
00:49:48.551 --> 00:49:49.384
<v Speaker 2>europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way to do it will be to shut </v>

1063
00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:52.533
<v Speaker 2>down and stop legitimate public feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>about things and to say that is no good </v>

1064
00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:00.250
<v Speaker 2>saying that you objected to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>migration on facebook.</v>

1065
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.520
<v Speaker 2>It should be stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the biggest way,</v>

1066
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:06.730
<v Speaker 2>the fastest way to make sure the volcano</v>
<v Speaker 2>blows out of the site.</v>

1067
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems so obvious to me that this </v>

1068
00:50:09.301 --> 00:50:13.500
<v Speaker 1>is what the regressive left has done by </v>
<v Speaker 1>labeling everyone who doesn't agree with</v>

1069
00:50:13.501 --> 00:50:14.334
<v Speaker 1>them racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've created a situation where good </v>

1070
00:50:16.381 --> 00:50:17.214
<v Speaker 1>intentioned people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals are now finding themselves </v>

1071
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.160
<v Speaker 1>agreeing on a lot of things with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the far right who they agree with.</v>

1072
00:50:23.161 --> 00:50:25.490
<v Speaker 1>nothing else on the danger,</v>

1073
00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1074
00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I think the fact</v>

1075
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what the left has done in recent</v>

1076
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:32.120
<v Speaker 1>years with the term racist has basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up,</v>

1077
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:33.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denuding the term of having any meaning </v>

1078
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or am or much meaning anyway,</v>

1079
00:50:37.761 --> 00:50:38.594
<v Speaker 1>because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everybody can be called a racist at </v>

1080
00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:42.500
<v Speaker 1>some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and generally very often,</v>

1081
00:50:42.501 --> 00:50:43.334
<v Speaker 1>at least for various various grounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that you basically got no </v>

1082
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:46.724
<v Speaker 1>terminology left when an actual racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes along and I can sort of sense the </v>

1083
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:53.060
<v Speaker 1>people just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to end up not caring.</v>

1084
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

1085
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I've always said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want this solved.</v>

1086
00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:56.923
<v Speaker 1>I want this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These sorts of problems dealt with in </v>

1087
00:50:59.361 --> 00:51:00.194
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not dealt in the coming decades </v>

1088
00:51:01.701 --> 00:51:06.701
<v Speaker 1>by marine le pen and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hydration elements in Austria,</v>

1089
00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.870
<v Speaker 1>but a few people listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1090
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.733
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally hear that and that's why I'm </v>

1091
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:17.120
<v Speaker 1>trying to bring this message that if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get the left back,</v>

1092
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.970
<v Speaker 1>otherwise we're just going to hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything over to the right,</v>

1093
00:51:19.971 --> 00:51:20.870
<v Speaker 1>which would be a disaster.</v>

1094
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:21.703
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk a little more about the </v>

1095
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:23.750
<v Speaker 1>middle east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about Israel.</v>

1096
00:51:23.751 --> 00:51:24.584
<v Speaker 1>Palestine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can probably knock that out and just </v>

1097
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.560
<v Speaker 1>a few minutes and everyone will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied.</v>

1098
00:51:27.561 --> 00:51:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1099
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.560
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So buddy seconds,</v>

1100
00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.760
<v Speaker 1>thIrty seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

1101
00:51:31.761 --> 00:51:36.470
<v Speaker 1>So I thought maybe the best way to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because I do know how much you know</v>

1102
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:37.980
<v Speaker 1>about history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1103
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:41.900
<v Speaker 1>where should we start with this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm noticing lately is that,</v>

1104
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:42.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we're seeing the stabbings and the </v>

1105
00:51:44.391 --> 00:51:45.224
<v Speaker 1>shootings and all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the debate is rarely about what's </v>

1106
00:51:47.421 --> 00:51:48.254
<v Speaker 1>happening right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now the debate is starting to be on </v>

1107
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.560
<v Speaker 1>the partition plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1108
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:52.394
<v Speaker 1>the british mandate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now it's starting to be unfurled </v>

1109
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:58.640
<v Speaker 1>and people don't understand history as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we alluded to earlier.</v>

1110
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:59.563
<v Speaker 1>So where is a good place if we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a decent discussion and try to </v>

1111
00:52:01.971 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 1>get some common ground here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is a good place to start with the,</v>

1112
00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:07.910
<v Speaker 1>with the Israel palestine situation?</v>

1113
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I think the only place you to start is </v>
<v Speaker 2>from where we are really,</v>

1114
00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:14.723
<v Speaker 2>and an acceptance that on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are broadly anti as well and </v>

1115
00:52:18.391 --> 00:52:21.780
<v Speaker 2>acceptance by those people that Israel </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists and that it's not going anywhere.</v>

1116
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1117
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:23.563
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spent a lot of time there in the </v>

1118
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:25.844
<v Speaker 2>surrounding areas and the west bank and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so on and spoken with a lot of </v>

1119
00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:29.693
<v Speaker 2>palestinian representatives and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the saddest things is when </v>

1120
00:52:33.241 --> 00:52:34.074
<v Speaker 2>you hear them talk about the occupation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you discovered that talking about </v>

1121
00:52:37.501 --> 00:52:40.800
<v Speaker 2>the occupation from 1948 because then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

1122
00:52:40.801 --> 00:52:42.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1123
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:45.600
<v Speaker 2>you're giving your future generations </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1124
00:52:45.601 --> 00:52:46.434
<v Speaker 2>hope you're selling them a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're telling them that we'll get back </v>

1125
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.540
<v Speaker 2>to tel aviv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1126
00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:54.510
<v Speaker 2>we'll get back to the whole of jerusalem</v>
<v Speaker 2>will get back heifer.</v>

1127
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:58.130
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not going to happen is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a bit,</v>

1128
00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:00.180
<v Speaker 2>they're selling the young people a </v>
<v Speaker 2>crock.</v>

1129
00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:05.250
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's a tragedy if it's,</v>

1130
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.440
<v Speaker 2>if they accepted that Israel is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going anywhere and Israel felt confident</v>

1131
00:53:11.011 --> 00:53:13.770
<v Speaker 2>enough that the palestinians accepted </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1132
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:17.580
<v Speaker 2>then the negotiations for the border </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispute,</v>

1133
00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1134
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.190
<v Speaker 2>frankly quite straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1135
00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:22.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see,</v>

1136
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.090
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see them on the ground.</v>

1137
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:26.340
<v Speaker 2>You can see basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1138
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the israelis have one and basically when</v>

1139
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:31.560
<v Speaker 2>the palestinians have one and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>see that,</v>

1140
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:31.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1141
00:53:31.931 --> 00:53:32.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1142
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:33.413
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basis for what's often been called </v>

1143
00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.260
<v Speaker 2>the world's ugliest border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1144
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.950
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1145
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:40.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to start from the premise,</v>

1146
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.380
<v Speaker 2>let Israel is not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1147
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:45.900
<v Speaker 2>and I think it is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>striking things,</v>

1148
00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in 2015,</v>

1149
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:52.350
<v Speaker 2>so many debates on college campuses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the media and so on,</v>

1150
00:53:52.351 --> 00:53:54.420
<v Speaker 2>don't accept that fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1151
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:59.230
<v Speaker 2>if we had a conversation about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan and uh,</v>

1152
00:53:59.231 --> 00:54:01.740
<v Speaker 2>and we started by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1153
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:05.230
<v Speaker 2>should Pakistan have been created or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a mistake?</v>

1154
00:54:05.231 --> 00:54:07.140
<v Speaker 2>And we wonder If we could rectify this </v>
<v Speaker 2>error.</v>

1155
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:08.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would say,</v>

1156
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.830
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 20 slash 15.</v>

1157
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan's got all sorts of problems we </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to talk about.</v>

1158
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we talking about this?</v>

1159
00:54:15.241 --> 00:54:16.074
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem from seven decades </v>

1160
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:19.350
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be a maniac.</v>

1161
00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:20.853
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1162
00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.400
<v Speaker 2>but on Israel that's thought quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>

1163
00:54:23.401 --> 00:54:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Israel and Pakistan to the same age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these,</v>

1164
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 2>these crazy Israel obsessives uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1165
00:54:29.461 --> 00:54:33.450
<v Speaker 2>keeP going back to the basis and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to win.</v>

1166
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.830
<v Speaker 2>That's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's done.</v>

1167
00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.870
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make of these people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>so because I see that,</v>

1168
00:54:37.871 --> 00:54:38.704
<v Speaker 1>I see very clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to tweet as much stuff as I can </v>

1169
00:54:40.841 --> 00:54:41.674
<v Speaker 1>about coexistence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want there to be two states for two </v>

1170
00:54:44.171 --> 00:54:47.290
<v Speaker 1>people and understand that people can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in occupation.</v>

1171
00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.273
<v Speaker 1>And I want everyone to be treated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dignity and have the right to self </v>

1172
00:54:51.251 --> 00:54:54.190
<v Speaker 1>determination and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I see nothing except on the,</v>

1173
00:54:54.191 --> 00:54:55.024
<v Speaker 1>on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I see is just this relentless </v>

1174
00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:58.900
<v Speaker 1>demonization of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter,</v>

1175
00:54:58.930 --> 00:54:59.950
<v Speaker 1>no matter what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1176
00:54:59.951 --> 00:55:02.400
<v Speaker 1>they left gaza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not one jew and guys,</v>

1177
00:55:02.401 --> 00:55:03.700
<v Speaker 1>a hitler would love the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1178
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1179
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd feel right at home in certain Way.</v>

1180
00:55:06.531 --> 00:55:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:08.740
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1182
00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:13.670
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you said tuesday,</v>

1183
00:55:13.671 --> 00:55:15.710
<v Speaker 2>the tuesday solution doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dead.</v>

1184
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.210
<v Speaker 2>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1185
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:18.083
<v Speaker 2>the best you can hope for now as a three</v>
<v Speaker 2>state solution because it's in no one's </v>

1186
00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.660
<v Speaker 2>gift to unite the palestinian.</v>

1187
00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:22.391
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to,</v>

1188
00:55:22.391 --> 00:55:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to ask you about that too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it really is a three states.</v>

1189
00:55:24.861 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1190
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:25.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1191
00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:26.523
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be which you'd stopped using the </v>

1192
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:29.310
<v Speaker 2>two to state idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1193
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:34.670
<v Speaker 2>but you then have to ask some serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions about the negotiating partners</v>

1194
00:55:36.001 --> 00:55:39.270
<v Speaker 2>on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now people like to say here and again,</v>

1195
00:55:39.271 --> 00:55:40.500
<v Speaker 2>the clever thing to say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1196
00:55:40.501 --> 00:55:41.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six of one,</v>

1197
00:55:41.341 --> 00:55:42.174
<v Speaker 2>half a dozen of the other and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is simply not the case that the </v>

1198
00:55:45.391 --> 00:55:46.224
<v Speaker 2>israeli prime minister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it Uses the rhetoric about the </v>

1199
00:55:48.151 --> 00:55:50.880
<v Speaker 2>palestinians like palestinian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate,</v>

1200
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.863
<v Speaker 2>so called moderate leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mahmoud abbas is used in recent weeks </v>

1201
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.860
<v Speaker 2>about the jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1202
00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:59.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mahmoud abbas was talking about the,</v>

1203
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.110
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1204
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:04.050
<v Speaker 2>we don't want the filthy feet of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jews on our holy sites.</v>

1205
00:56:04.051 --> 00:56:08.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean this doesn't even get very much </v>
<v Speaker 2>coverage outside of the region.</v>

1206
00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.440
<v Speaker 2>And if benjamin netanyahu had made a </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech where he said,</v>

1207
00:56:13.441 --> 00:56:17.790
<v Speaker 2>we don't want any filthy muslim or arab </v>
<v Speaker 2>feet in our land,</v>

1208
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I reckon that would've made the front </v>
<v Speaker 2>paGe of the New York times,</v>

1209
00:56:21.571 --> 00:56:23.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be being,</v>

1210
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.393
<v Speaker 2>I think people would know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does the most extraordinary incitement </v>

1211
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.760
<v Speaker 2>now in the most extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 2>denigration and,</v>

1212
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.350
<v Speaker 2>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

1213
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:33.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly,</v>

1214
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:34.204
<v Speaker 2>right thinking people in the west can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to say this is the man with whom you </v>

1215
00:56:37.571 --> 00:56:41.460
<v Speaker 2>must do piece because he's not as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1216
00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the world should,</v>

1217
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:46.960
<v Speaker 2>should concentrate less on the israeli </v>
<v Speaker 2>palestinian dispute.</v>

1218
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1219
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:49.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over egged.</v>

1220
00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:52.750
<v Speaker 2>It's got too much attention on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of the attention helps.</v>

1221
00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 2>there are intractable problems around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1222
00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sovereign question,</v>

1223
00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.580
<v Speaker 2>the western starland question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cypress,</v>

1224
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.850
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1225
00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:02.873
<v Speaker 2>and actually a massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>international opprobrium and attention </v>

1226
00:57:07.031 --> 00:57:10.330
<v Speaker 2>do nothing to solve these conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1227
00:57:10.331 --> 00:57:11.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1228
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.880
<v Speaker 2>we have seen in recent years the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1229
00:57:13.881 --> 00:57:14.714
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motif of our time fall apart in the </v>

1230
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 2>middle east.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

1231
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:18.903
<v Speaker 2>and it was said by everybody from light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from right and left throughout my </v>

1232
00:57:21.401 --> 00:57:22.390
<v Speaker 2>upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At any rate,</v>

1233
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:26.530
<v Speaker 2>if you could only unlock the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the paleStinian israeli dispute,</v>

1234
00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.780
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the middle east will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>solved.</v>

1235
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I heard this for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1236
00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:32.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the israeli palestinian border </v>

1237
00:57:33.761 --> 00:57:38.710
<v Speaker 2>dispute and the economy of Yemen will </v>
<v Speaker 2>boom and the iranians will see the point</v>

1238
00:57:38.711 --> 00:57:41.550
<v Speaker 2>of gay rights and the saudis will </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

1239
00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the potential utility of women in this </v>

1240
00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:47.500
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was obviously nonsense then,</v>

1241
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:48.663
<v Speaker 2>but we've seen it's nonsense in recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>years we've seen it because the middle </v>

1242
00:57:51.671 --> 00:57:55.780
<v Speaker 2>east has managed to fall apart with zero</v>
<v Speaker 2>israeli involvement.</v>

1243
00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:59.200
<v Speaker 1>YeAh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that the bigger issue here?</v>

1244
00:57:59.201 --> 00:58:00.034
<v Speaker 1>Is that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're really talking about a three </v>

1245
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.353
<v Speaker 1>day thing because gaza and the west bank</v>
<v Speaker 1>are totally separate ruled by different </v>

1246
00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:09.100
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason to think that if a</v>

1247
00:58:09.101 --> 00:58:12.850
<v Speaker 1>boss signed an agreement that hamas </v>
<v Speaker 1>would abide by it.</v>

1248
00:58:12.851 --> 00:58:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their,</v>

1249
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:15.130
<v Speaker 1>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1250
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:16.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1251
00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.830
<v Speaker 1>what do they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their charter.</v>

1252
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.670
<v Speaker 1>It says Kill all the jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not going to suddenly change,</v>

1253
00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:22.563
<v Speaker 1>so they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the strange part as I see </v>

1254
00:58:23.891 --> 00:58:27.040
<v Speaker 1>people in the west saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1255
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just make a solution,</v>

1256
00:58:28.901 --> 00:58:31.330
<v Speaker 1>make a magical solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll stop wanting to kill you.</v>

1257
00:58:31.331 --> 00:58:33.000
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't seem like there's a</v>

1258
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:35.790
<v Speaker 2>connection for those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about the middle east.</v>

1259
00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.330
<v Speaker 2>They've gfo never been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

1260
00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.290
<v Speaker 2>they don't know anyone there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1261
00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:44.430
<v Speaker 2>it's about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goes back to that point I made the star.</v>

1262
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.000
<v Speaker 2>It's about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1263
00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:46.780
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1264
00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.890
<v Speaker 2>if you say how concerned you are about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this situation,</v>

1265
00:58:49.891 --> 00:58:54.290
<v Speaker 2>you come across as virtuous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledgeable cad.</v>

1266
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:55.200
<v Speaker 2>It's way out,</v>

1267
00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.213
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet there's one place in the middle </v>

1268
00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.940
<v Speaker 1>east that stands for their progressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>values</v>

1269
00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:03.660
<v Speaker 2>now and now they use the progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>values against it.</v>

1270
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you highlight the fact that,</v>

1271
00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:06.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1279
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:23.360
<v Speaker 2>for me it's not a detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1280
00:59:23.361 --> 00:59:25.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mind whether I'm hanging with or not,</v>

<v Speaker 2>mind whether other gays are hanged on </v>
<v Speaker 2>our mind,</v>

1283
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:33.800
<v Speaker 2>what their views are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a whole range of things in mind.</v>

1284
00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:37.520
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between a society </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Israel is actually talking about what</v>

1285
00:59:37.521 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 2>you do about ivf rights for lesbian </v>
<v Speaker 2>couples and a few miles away,</v>

1286
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:43.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbians,</v>

1287
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:44.203
<v Speaker 2>lesbians don't get a look in on the ivf </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment or anything else I mind about </v>

1288
00:59:47.331 --> 00:59:48.710
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are details,</v>

1289
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:51.440
<v Speaker 2>but all of these things that used to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things we used to say,</v>

1290
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.850
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we used to call me,</v>

1291
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:57.530
<v Speaker 2>the things that matter are now a brushed</v>
<v Speaker 2>aside as being odd.</v>

1292
00:59:57.531 --> 00:59:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Don't you bore me with all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

1293
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.540
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

1294
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:02.660
<v Speaker 2>all those facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you keep comIng up with.</v>

1295
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1296
01:00:03.941 --> 01:00:06.760
<v Speaker 1>well you gave me a great segue there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to discuss one personal</v>

1297
01:00:06.761 --> 01:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>thing with you because you're,</v>

1298
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get.</v>

1299
01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>

1300
01:00:10.501 --> 01:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>We'll see how far I can push it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're openly gay.</v>

1301
01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>That phrase seems silly to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gay.</v>

1302
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wonder if for you.</v>

1303
01:00:19.381 --> 01:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm gay also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know that,</v>

1304
01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1305
01:00:22.261 --> 01:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>and it shouldn't matter in any context </v>
<v Speaker 1>of anything we're talking about here,</v>

1306
01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.153
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of the principles that you're </v>

1307
01:00:29.161 --> 01:00:29.994
<v Speaker 1>talking about and wanting to help when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about the lesbian that might </v>

1308
01:00:33.001 --> 01:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>live in gaza under hamas or any of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1309
01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people being thrown off the roofs by</v>

1310
01:00:38.791 --> 01:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>isis or women's rights here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1311
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>how much of whAt you talk about and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you care about,</v>

1312
01:00:43.711 --> 01:00:44.544
<v Speaker 1>do you think has been colored by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you and a lot of respects are </v>

1313
01:00:48.181 --> 01:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>the other at the same time?</v>

1314
01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit.</v>

1315
01:00:51.821 --> 01:00:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it's easy to over again most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my political ideas or not,</v>

1316
01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not based on I know who I am or,</v>

1317
01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.410
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1318
01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.280
<v Speaker 2>then I like to think they're not me </v>
<v Speaker 2>centric.</v>

1319
01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:05.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like in politics on me centric </v>

1320
01:01:07.691 --> 01:01:09.610
<v Speaker 2>because I'm something therefore I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1321
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:10.833
<v Speaker 2>I like to think I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to use reason and go beyond </v>

1322
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:14.803
<v Speaker 2>identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose there was some things which </v>

1323
01:01:16.031 --> 01:01:18.610
<v Speaker 2>you notice some things which you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice first.</v>

1324
01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:22.090
<v Speaker 2>I do have a sort of view that when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to radical islam,</v>

1325
01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.273
<v Speaker 2>of what we've seen in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a set of early warning sirens going off </v>

1326
01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:31.030
<v Speaker 2>basically around the world and some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those early warning sirens are gay.</v>

1327
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them,</v>

1328
01:01:33.241 --> 01:01:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean bruce banner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1329
01:01:34.661 --> 01:01:38.740
<v Speaker 2>the gay writer in scandinavia who went </v>
<v Speaker 2>off as an early warning signal,</v>

1330
01:01:38.741 --> 01:01:39.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1331
01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.720
<v Speaker 2>some of them are feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are,</v>

1332
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:44.803
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are from our religious </v>

1333
01:01:47.051 --> 01:01:50.500
<v Speaker 2>dissidence or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minorities within a minority.</v>

1334
01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:53.080
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course some of jews.</v>

1335
01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.213
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a way that's interesting </v>

1336
01:01:56.321 --> 01:01:57.154
<v Speaker 2>because as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think it's a basis for my interest </v>

1337
01:01:59.681 --> 01:02:03.390
<v Speaker 2>or focus on these areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's true that the,</v>

1338
01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.330
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1339
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a lovely phrase that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>composer benjamin britten volunteers,</v>

1340
01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.000
<v Speaker 2>and I'll let her to another composer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that,</v>

1341
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.133
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the composers have one less layer of </v>

1342
01:02:11.531 --> 01:02:12.364
<v Speaker 2>skin than everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've often often thought that might </v>

1343
01:02:16.061 --> 01:02:16.894
<v Speaker 2>apply in some of these very programmatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>world events that were sort of starting </v>

1344
01:02:22.921 --> 01:02:23.754
<v Speaker 2>to go through at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there are a set of people who </v>

1345
01:02:26.221 --> 01:02:29.610
<v Speaker 2>feel it just a little bit before </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else.</v>

1346
01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.940
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's true of gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of gay people,</v>

1347
01:02:32.941 --> 01:02:33.774
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them have raised close to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't care a lot or don't take </v>

1348
01:02:37.201 --> 01:02:39.210
<v Speaker 2>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's true of a lot of jews.</v>

1349
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it's true of a lot of minorities</v>
<v Speaker 2>within islam who suffered,</v>

1350
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:44.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1351
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:47.610
<v Speaker 2>and others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's true that it might be a habit,</v>

1352
01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:50.550
<v Speaker 2>sort of early warning effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But apart from that,</v>

1353
01:02:50.551 --> 01:02:51.384
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to think that my politics don't </v>

1354
01:02:54.391 --> 01:02:55.890
<v Speaker 2>come from any rabbit.</v>

1355
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1356
01:02:56.801 --> 01:02:57.634
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the same thing about myself </v>

1357
01:02:58.511 --> 01:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>because I hate identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

1358
01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.013
<v Speaker 1>And yet I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel this kinship when I hear about </v>

1359
01:03:04.211 --> 01:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>gay people being killed somewhere in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle east just for being who they are.</v>

1360
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also,</v>

1361
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>when you repress all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fertile ground for all of the awful</v>

1362
01:03:14.711 --> 01:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>religious stuff to also take root.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's so multilayered.</v>

1363
01:03:18.251 --> 01:03:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1364
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.480
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1365
01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:19.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1366
01:03:19.861 --> 01:03:20.694
<v Speaker 2>I do think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think the big problem of our time </v>

1367
01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:24.100
<v Speaker 2>is the identity in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1368
01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:25.610
<v Speaker 2>in the western side is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>

1369
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:30.530
<v Speaker 2>is this basically self centered way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking into the world.</v>

1370
01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:31.683
<v Speaker 2>I haven't absolute bugbear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is people who start Questions by </v>

1371
01:03:34.761 --> 01:03:37.310
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking as a and then say,</v>

1372
01:03:37.311 --> 01:03:39.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking as a gay man or whatever.</v>

1373
01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:40.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1374
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:43.550
<v Speaker 2>you do it if you know it's going to wind</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell out of someone I suppose.</v>

1375
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:46.460
<v Speaker 2>But I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it when people start off as</v>

1376
01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.850
<v Speaker 2>either speaking as a woman of puerto </v>
<v Speaker 2>rican descent or anything.</v>

1377
01:03:49.851 --> 01:03:50.750
<v Speaker 2>I get it again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1378
01:03:50.810 --> 01:03:52.670
<v Speaker 2>if your point is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be valid,</v>

1379
01:03:52.671 --> 01:03:54.900
<v Speaker 2>whoever's saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1380
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:56.700
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1381
01:03:56.810 --> 01:03:58.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole,</v>

1382
01:03:58.971 --> 01:03:59.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1383
01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:00.083
<v Speaker 2>the amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing a moment of that sort of </v>

1384
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.390
<v Speaker 2>breakdown.</v>

1385
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:05.610
<v Speaker 2>I think of identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's having a breakdown.</v>

1386
01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:06.453
<v Speaker 2>I at the moment and that partly is it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming because it was always going to </v>

1387
01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.413
<v Speaker 2>collapse under the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way to its own absurdities and the </v>

1388
01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:14.474
<v Speaker 2>only answer to that when you sift </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the rubble of that strange </v>

1389
01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.393
<v Speaker 2>spasmic collike movement in recent years</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the only way out of it will be </v>

1390
01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:25.160
<v Speaker 2>through reason and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1391
01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:27.990
<v Speaker 2>and using rationalism and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1392
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:30.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not trying to work out what we think</v>

1393
01:04:30.561 --> 01:04:34.700
<v Speaker 2>about the world from what is most </v>
<v Speaker 2>convenient for me because I may,</v>

1394
01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.193
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trying to work things out on </v>

1395
01:04:37.521 --> 01:04:40.490
<v Speaker 2>principles and there's quite a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>work to do.</v>

1396
01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is so crazy because when you think</v>

1397
01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:45.630
<v Speaker 1>about it now I've sat here with you for </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably about 50 minutes or so.</v>

1398
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.673
<v Speaker 1>I got no indication that you Were racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a xenophobe or any of the other </v>

1399
01:04:49.741 --> 01:04:50.574
<v Speaker 1>things that people might say about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only got an indication that you want </v>

1400
01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:57.570
<v Speaker 1>to deal with the realities as they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not sort of as you want them to be.</v>

1401
01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:59.240
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my last question for ya,</v>

1402
01:04:59.241 --> 01:05:00.074
<v Speaker 1>and I barely looked at my notes because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we could do this for hours and I hope </v>

1403
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.810
<v Speaker 1>next time you're in town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

1404
01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:08.040
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it in person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my last question is gimme gimme some</v>

1405
01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we,</v>

1406
01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.210
<v Speaker 1>what can we take at this interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment as you said,</v>

1407
01:05:12.211 --> 01:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>you see identity politics crumbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the same thing.</v>

1408
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:20.500
<v Speaker 1>What can we as a secular people as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as atheists,</v>

1409
01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>as people that care about gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff.</v>

1410
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.720
<v Speaker 1>WhaT can we take from this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>precarious moment where at and,</v>

1411
01:05:26.721 --> 01:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>and sort of feel good for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the future.</v>

1412
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think optimism is overrated.</v>

1413
01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:37.453
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One has to be optimistic or pessimistic </v>

1414
01:05:39.491 --> 01:05:40.324
<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have to sort of look at </v>

1415
01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:41.644
<v Speaker 2>things as they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you might wake up in the </v>

1416
01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 2>morning feeling optimistic and you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose it by lunchtime.</v>

1417
01:05:46.421 --> 01:05:47.254
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you might go out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evening feeling pessimistic and come </v>

1418
01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.410
<v Speaker 2>home optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

1419
01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:53.860
<v Speaker 2>These are things that come and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1420
01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.053
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot that one can be </v>

1421
01:05:56.591 --> 01:05:58.870
<v Speaker 2>optimistic about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1422
01:05:59.110 --> 01:05:59.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1423
01:05:59.721 --> 01:06:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I do have a view that I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>finish a book about this at the moment.</v>

1424
01:06:03.401 --> 01:06:04.234
<v Speaker 2>I do have a view that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that multimedia and </v>

1425
01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:12.230
<v Speaker 2>social media things has done and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing at the moment is,</v>

1426
01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:13.103
<v Speaker 2>is it going to create a reform within </v>
<v Speaker 2>islam or change within islam because </v>

1427
01:06:18.251 --> 01:06:23.251
<v Speaker 2>what people are having to face up to is </v>
<v Speaker 2>now coming to them at a speed which in,</v>

1428
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:26.703
<v Speaker 2>for instance in christianity took a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of centuries to drift down from </v>

1429
01:06:30.401 --> 01:06:33.850
<v Speaker 2>learning institutions in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1430
01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:36.970
<v Speaker 2>down to the person on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1431
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:38.890
<v Speaker 2>that took a couple of centuries in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

1432
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:41.650
<v Speaker 2>And now it's happening with unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>

1433
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the bad news,</v>

1434
01:06:43.901 --> 01:06:47.560
<v Speaker 2>quite bloody and a very bad for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

1435
01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:48.773
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after that it means that we'll be </v>

1436
01:06:50.861 --> 01:06:54.160
<v Speaker 2>out of it within a fairly short space of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1437
01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as for other things,</v>

1438
01:06:56.441 --> 01:06:57.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1439
01:06:57.210 --> 01:07:00.220
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's access to ideas and things,</v>

1440
01:07:00.221 --> 01:07:01.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously we hear a lot about all of the</v>

1441
01:07:01.841 --> 01:07:03.880
<v Speaker 2>craziness that goes on the web and </v>
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere,</v>

1442
01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:07.750
<v Speaker 2>but people's access to ideas now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never been better.</v>

1443
01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people,</v>

1444
01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:12.370
<v Speaker 2>people geT to find out the good things </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1445
01:07:12.371 --> 01:07:13.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1446
01:07:13.931 --> 01:07:14.764
<v Speaker 2>you can open your computer in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and read about a train crash </v>

1447
01:07:18.191 --> 01:07:22.030
<v Speaker 2>somewhere that you've never heard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>until that day.</v>

1448
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:23.103
<v Speaker 2>And you can feel sad for a bit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people do and people feel overwhelmed </v>

1449
01:07:26.831 --> 01:07:28.030
<v Speaker 2>with the amount of information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1450
01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:29.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of negative things.</v>

1451
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:30.820
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1452
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in middle of that as well,</v>

1453
01:07:32.501 --> 01:07:33.334
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a life and you have to </v>

1454
01:07:34.991 --> 01:07:37.420
<v Speaker 2>try to think your way through the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are going on.</v>

1455
01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:39.030
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

1456
01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:43.830
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing is the appeal </v>
<v Speaker 2>for something beyond a,</v>

1457
01:07:43.831 --> 01:07:47.170
<v Speaker 2>a utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something other than utopia.</v>

1458
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:48.303
<v Speaker 2>Religions and others constantly told </v>
<v Speaker 2>people how to get utopia in the </v>

1459
01:07:51.731 --> 01:07:52.564
<v Speaker 2>afterlife when this life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most political movements promise people </v>

1460
01:07:55.061 --> 01:07:59.290
<v Speaker 2>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utopia is called utopia for a reason.</v>

1461
01:07:59.291 --> 01:08:02.470
<v Speaker 2>It's no place it doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never did.</v>

1462
01:08:02.471 --> 01:08:05.410
<v Speaker 2>It never will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the meantime,</v>

1463
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.633
<v Speaker 2>it's a much better thing to think of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can make the lives of the people </v>

1464
01:08:09.551 --> 01:08:10.384
<v Speaker 2>around you better and how you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadly have a good influence in the </v>

1465
01:08:13.511 --> 01:08:14.344
<v Speaker 2>world at the time you've gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not to think that your role is to </v>

1466
01:08:18.171 --> 01:08:19.004
<v Speaker 2>make everything else better for everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>else in the world when you come to even </v>

1467
01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:27.280
<v Speaker 2>help mom with the dishes unit and and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1468
01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.280
<v Speaker 2>but as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1469
01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.113
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I can think of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's positive is the fact that all </v>

1470
01:08:32.181 --> 01:08:33.014
<v Speaker 2>this is happening so fast now that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>as things can screw up at an amazing </v>

1471
01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:39.710
<v Speaker 2>speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible.</v>

1472
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:43.550
<v Speaker 2>It is possible that they can also be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sold at an amazing speed,</v>

1473
01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:46.940
<v Speaker 2>but that won't bring us nirvana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just is an appeal that,</v>

1474
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:49.490
<v Speaker 2>that will have to keep on paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

1475
01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:53.660
<v Speaker 2>I have to keep on concentrating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading and thinking about these things.</v>

1476
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.960
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

1477
01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that was pretty lofty right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1478
01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:58.933
<v Speaker 1>It was a pleasure chatting with you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I fully get why so many people wanted </v>

1479
01:09:01.941 --> 01:09:03.320
<v Speaker 1>this to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1480
01:09:03.321 --> 01:09:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I should mention that your ebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>islam ophelia,</v>

1481

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1482
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:09.403
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're rolling it into a new book that </v>

1483
01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.080
<v Speaker 1>you're working on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm very proud is affiliate with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ebook I wrote a quite swiftly a couple </v>

1485
01:09:16.530 --> 01:09:17.363
<v Speaker 2>years ago and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1486
