1
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.973
<v Speaker 1>Alright everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing something a little different </v>

2
00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:10.540
<v Speaker 1>with the direct message this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually in the suburbs of DC at the</v>

3
00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can probably hear the Cicadas in the</v>

4
00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.303
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do a direct message about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the RNC and everything that's going on </v>

6
00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:20.194
<v Speaker 1>in Cleveland right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then last night you all have heard </v>

7
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:23.584
<v Speaker 1>this already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos was officially banned </v>

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.730
<v Speaker 1>for all time for the rest of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

9
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.890
<v Speaker 1>He was banned on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:36.490
<v Speaker 1>he had lost his blue verification check </v>
<v Speaker 1>a back A.</v>

11
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Milo and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we become sort of comrades were friends.</v>

12
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't agree on everything.</v>

13
00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:43.024
<v Speaker 1>I've brought him on the show twice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done a couple of other things </v>

14
00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:46.180
<v Speaker 1>where we've had a healthy exchange of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

15
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 1>We've gone to ucla together where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were protesting for exercising our right</v>

16
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:51.424
<v Speaker 1>to free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone out of my way to show some of </v>

17
00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 1>the differences that I have with Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

18
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.733
<v Speaker 1>I always make the distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctrine of Islam and the various </v>

19
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.863
<v Speaker 1>people that are of Muslim faith who </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice their faith completely </v>

20
00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:07.090
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some totally nominally and some that are</v>

21
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.163
<v Speaker 1>violent jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the different things that are in </v>

22
00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:10.534
<v Speaker 1>there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo was banned from twitter and there </v>

23
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:16.090
<v Speaker 1>is a free speech issue here and as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys know,</v>

24
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm all about free speech and the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange of ideas.</v>

25
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 1>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a first amendment issue.</v>

26
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:21.754
<v Speaker 1>The First Amendment of the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>means the government can come through </v>

27
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:25.210
<v Speaker 1>your for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your free speech.</v>

28
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I've said many times before at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment in 2016 in America,</v>

29
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that afraid that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's coming from my free speech.</v>

30
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.463
<v Speaker 1>I think we're taking it from ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is a good example of </v>

31
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:35.801
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 1>twitter and facebook and snapchat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of these things,</v>

33
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.693
<v Speaker 1>they become almost too powerful in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to control speech because these </v>

34
00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:48.370
<v Speaker 1>are now the roadways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.203
<v Speaker 1>These are the super highways for us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other beyond our </v>

36
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:53.074
<v Speaker 1>ability to pick up the phone and call a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and talk to people on the street </v>

37
00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:55.804
<v Speaker 1>and scream from town square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our ability to communicate with </v>

38
00:01:57.881 --> 00:01:58.714
<v Speaker 1>literally thousands and thousands and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Myeloma case hundreds of thousands if </v>

39
00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 1>not millions of people on these </v>
<v Speaker 1>platforms.</v>

40
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.703
<v Speaker 1>It's hugely powerful and there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's happening right now </v>

41
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>where it's not necessary about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

42
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's about companies now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

43
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.140
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a private company.</v>

44
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:15.430
<v Speaker 1>They're publicly traded reit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

45
00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>they are allowed to instill their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of service,</v>

46
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 1>which they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they say he violated them,</v>

47
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 1>then yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can ban him.</v>

48
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying twitter can't do what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

49
00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying the government is </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in this in any way.</v>

50
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.313
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking about the principles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free exchange of ideas and free </v>

51
00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:32.950
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

52
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.780
<v Speaker 1>These things are under threat right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

53
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.710
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

54
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 1>forget the nitty gritty details of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the last day or so.</v>

55
00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even fully aware of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and there's a lot of tweets.</v>

56
00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't follow everybody's tweets every </v>
<v Speaker 1>second to see exactly what happened.</v>

57
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.403
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that Milo is a </v>

58
00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:50.224
<v Speaker 1>provocateur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He intentionally shit posts and gets </v>

59
00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:55.810
<v Speaker 1>people riled up and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people respond to that.</v>

60
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:58.630
<v Speaker 1>And some people will respond to us </v>
<v Speaker 1>something a little more nuanced,</v>

61
00:02:58.631 --> 00:02:59.464
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like might do and get into an idea a </v>

62
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>little bit differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>

63
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter there are all kinds of Nazis.</v>

64
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:06.244
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the responses that Ben Shapiro </v>

65
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.183
<v Speaker 1>Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has fought with Ben Shapiro all the </v>

66
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>time and I was trying to moderate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate with them.</v>

67
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's still gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro,</v>

68
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>who was an orthodox Jew post anything on</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

69
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:22.021
<v Speaker 1>he gets a zillion Nazis photoshopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>his head in ovens and horrific picked,</v>

70
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>put picturing him in Auschwitz.</v>

71
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.023
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of horrible stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim people get all kinds of horrible </v>

72
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>imagery shown to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gay People,</v>

73
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.693
<v Speaker 1>people young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get fag and Jus bag and rob about all </v>

74
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My book,</v>

75
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.293
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're exercising their free speech if </v>

76
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>these people are not calling directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>for violence or acted on violence.</v>

77
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>As far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo has never called to harm anybody.</v>

78
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>He's never directly called for violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>in any way.</v>

79
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>He's a provocateur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sharing his thoughts.</v>

80
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have to understand the difference</v>

81
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>between words and actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

82
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:57.634
<v Speaker 1>Like just somebody sitting in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement sharing a Nazi meme and Milo </v>

83
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:02.764
<v Speaker 1>saying this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's directed at a person </v>

84
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.861
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

85
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't like what you're doing to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

86
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.253
<v Speaker 1>the girl in ghostbusters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I didn't like the movie or whatever </v>

87
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:11.464
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he can't control whether his </v>

88
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.673
<v Speaker 1>people say mean things to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what the mute button for and </v>

89
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>that's what the block buttons for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point is.</v>

90
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.303
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure out how to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy exchange of ideas and realize </v>

91
00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:21.494
<v Speaker 1>that not everything that that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met online world is transferred </v>

92
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>directly into the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If real people started using.</v>

93
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>If people start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a Nazi party appeared and said,</v>

94
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>started saying we're going to kill all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jews were going to kill all Muslims,</v>

95
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have a problem,</v>

96
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>a direct call for violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now that's not where we're at.</v>

97
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>And there's an issue here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a couple issues here,</v>

98
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.793
<v Speaker 1>but to me the primary issue is the power</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these social media companies have </v>

99
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 1>and we can't pretend that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a political agenda,</v>

100
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:56.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all pretty left organization,</v>

101
00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:57.264
<v Speaker 1>so of course they're really not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a guy like my look because it's </v>

102
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>easy always to attach style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>

103
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>stodgy old conservatives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans.</v>

104
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.803
<v Speaker 1>Milo represents something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's young and cool and gay and British </v>

105
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 1>and blonde and has this huge groundswell</v>
<v Speaker 1>of support.</v>

106
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.813
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's his support is from conservatives </v>

107
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 1>and liberals and all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

108
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I know that because when I went to Ucla </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him,</v>

109
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>I had liberals in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids college,</v>

110
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>kids from Ucla saying that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with anything he says,</v>

111
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>but they were there to defend his right </v>
<v Speaker 1>to free speech.</v>

112
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>So that strikes me a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>what Obiwan said to Darth Vader,</v>

113
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.823
<v Speaker 1>if you strike me down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll become more powerful than you can </v>

114
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine by striking him down </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and banning him from twitter.</v>

115
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 1>They're probably making this movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much stronger.</v>

116
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

117
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>It's complex and there's a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

118
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.093
<v Speaker 1>I would love to talk to someone from </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook about this because they band a </v>

119
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:48.094
<v Speaker 1>couple of people just in the last week </v>
<v Speaker 1>they banned my friend Feisal and my </v>

120
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>friend Melissa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both who'd been on the show,</v>

121
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 1>there'll be reinstated sense.</v>

122
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I would love to talk to Jack from </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

123
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to talk to any of these tech </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

124
00:05:56.861 --> 00:05:58.900
<v Speaker 1>So they're welcome to come on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

125
00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to inflame anything any </v>
<v Speaker 1>further.</v>

126
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:01.904
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely want to have this </v>

127
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:04.140
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

128
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.993
<v Speaker 1>and by the way right now you can go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter and you can check Ayatollah </v>

129
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Khomeini,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his twitter account.</v>

130
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>He regularly calls for another </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust.</v>

131
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 1>You can see what's going on with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president of Turkey,</v>

132
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>who right now in the midst of literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>just just assembling democracy there and</v>

133
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:22.150
<v Speaker 1>arresting protestors and sacking judges </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not letting people leave the country</v>

134
00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>because they have no problem with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>being on there.</v>

135
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>So there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an inconsistency in the way they</v>

136
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 1>apply these rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a lot of stuff here.</v>

137
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>But let's try to have a mature </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about it.</v>

138
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>And my guest this week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

139
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:33.524
<v Speaker 1>so as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we normally do this from the studio in </v>

140
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles.</v>

141
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm in DC right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is Michael Ian,</v>

142
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>black comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actor,</v>

143
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great guy.</v>

144
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.903
<v Speaker 1>He is a big in fighting you controls and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a really interesting discussion </v>

145
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>about fighting trolls and twitter Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk about Milo now.</v>

146
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>We shot this last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything that you're going to see a</v>

147
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.270
<v Speaker 1>is not about what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and today we shot it last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

149
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great discussion about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>very issues.</v>

150
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>So the timing is perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

151
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 1>and I appreciate it and I'll be back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio soon enough.</v>

152
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you guys for your support.</v>

153
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.733
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

154
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 2>My guest this week is a comedian and </v>
<v Speaker 2>author,</v>

155
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 2>an actor and a twitter Nazi hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Ian Black.</v>

156
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

157
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Which one of those would you say you </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly are?</v>

158
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Is it twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazi hunter,</v>

159
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 2>or comedian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably twitter.</v>

160
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Nazi hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

161
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.493
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

162
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not particularly funny these</v>

163
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.533
<v Speaker 2>days on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just annoying you are fighting the </v>

164
00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:39.331
<v Speaker 2>Nazis constantly on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my policy with the Nazis is,</v>

165
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:41.703
<v Speaker 2>congratulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys came up with a meme and you're </v>

166
00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:48.691
<v Speaker 2>alone in your basement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you liked engaging these people or I</v>

167
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:51.280
<v Speaker 2>don't know if you'd like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to put words in it,</v>

168
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.020
<v Speaker 2>but you do engage with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

169
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.913
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's valuable and important to </v>

170
00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:57.170
<v Speaker 4>engage these people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

171
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.503
<v Speaker 4>Because I think it's worth to the larger</v>
<v Speaker 4>public knowing that they're out there </v>

172
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 4>knowing that there is this a sub </v>
<v Speaker 4>subculture.</v>

173
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know how large it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm assuming it's very small.</v>

174
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like sub so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they are very vocal and uh,</v>

175
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.230
<v Speaker 4>my sense is there are</v>

176
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.513
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

177
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.703
<v Speaker 4>more sympathizers than a actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>participants and so I feel sort of duty </v>

178
00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 4>bound to hold to hold them up as idiots </v>
<v Speaker 4>so that,</v>

179
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 4>those who may be inclined to sympathize </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

180
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're idiots.</v>

181
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always anonymous too.</v>

182
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Are you ever finding a Nazi that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

183
00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:40.621
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

184
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:41.590
<v Speaker 2>this is my real picture</v>

185
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 4>new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always,</v>

186
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:44.144
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always either some pre pubescent </v>

187
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:53.050
<v Speaker 4>Japanese anime Avatar or some repurposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Hitler Youth Avatar.</v>

188
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you make of the Japanese</v>

189
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.203
<v Speaker 5>anime thing with related to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't think there's any </v>

190
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:01.840
<v Speaker 5>connections between Japanese and there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

191
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.693
<v Speaker 5>not between a Japanese anime and Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's absolutely some kind of </v>

192
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 5>connection between,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

193
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.043
<v Speaker 5>those who would move towards that </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideology and fetishizing pre pubescent </v>

194
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:14.874
<v Speaker 5>Japanese girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's actually a connection there and </v>

195
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.023
<v Speaker 5>I'll leave it to brighter minds than </v>
<v Speaker 5>mine to try to tie those two things </v>

196
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that absolutely exists.</v>

197
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.603
<v Speaker 5>You're just exposing them and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the social scientists that's trying </v>

198
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.843
<v Speaker 5>to figure out that you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you ever afraid that sometimes that </v>

199
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:29.394
<v Speaker 5>by fighting with them that it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>like elevating their relevance because </v>

200
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 5>that's a little bit of not fighting with</v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

201
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 5>but by exposing them and arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's absolutely a case to be made for</v>

202
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

203
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:42.923
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's more important from my </v>

204
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:51.060
<v Speaker 5>point of view to show that they're there</v>
<v Speaker 5>to just say,</v>

205
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

206
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.853
<v Speaker 5>this is who we're living among.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in the context of the current </v>

207
00:09:58.141 --> 00:09:58.974
<v Speaker 5>political climate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's important to let people </v>

208
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 5>know that these people exist and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh</v>

209
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.823
<v Speaker 6>hmm.</v>

210
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.410
<v Speaker 5>Given the right circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more of them could pop up.</v>

211
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I take it you're not against.</v>

212
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:12.680
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't be for banning them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

213
00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:13.940
<v Speaker 5>Like you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're exposing them,</v>

214
00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:15.640
<v Speaker 5>but you wish you would let them do their</v>
<v Speaker 5>job.</v>

215
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.580
<v Speaker 5>What you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

216
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.650
<v Speaker 5>that's why we have a first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

217
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.270
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

218
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.400
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

219
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.270
<v Speaker 5>and I don't report them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't do any of that shit.</v>

220
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

221
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.510
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just showed them.</v>

222
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.573
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's back up to the first thing you </v>

223
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:30.140
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is I used to be flooding.</v>

224
00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:31.360
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you said?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to be funny,</v>

225
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.080
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am not.</v>

226
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just annoying.</v>

227
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.883
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I feel that since I've been doing </v>

228
00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:38.720
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I did stand up and 12,</v>

229
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.350
<v Speaker 5>12 years in New York and a couple years </v>
<v Speaker 5>out here I used to be funny.</v>

230
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.483
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I can get you some letters to </v>

231
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.790
<v Speaker 5>show you later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was funny at one time,</v>

232
00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:49.490
<v Speaker 5>but now I'm talking about all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>serious stuff all the time and I like to</v>

233
00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:51.950
<v Speaker 5>try to pepper some comedy in there when </v>
<v Speaker 5>I can.</v>

234
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:52.903
<v Speaker 5>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world just feels particularly crazy </v>

235
00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:55.250
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it?</v>

236
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Which should be ideal for comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

237
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.243
<v Speaker 5>But I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not good at making light of things </v>

238
00:11:01.101 --> 00:11:03.980
<v Speaker 5>that I find deadly serious and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 5>not good at it.</v>

239
00:11:03.981 --> 00:11:04.814
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's great political comedians out </v>

240
00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 5>there and I'm not one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

241
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.960
<v Speaker 5>I can talk about my own life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in a funny way,</v>

242
00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:15.350
<v Speaker 5>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

243
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.430
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's people better able to talk about</v>

244
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:23.300
<v Speaker 5>trump and be hilarious than me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we'll get to trump in a second.</v>

245
00:11:23.301 --> 00:11:24.410
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

246
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.783
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always think of you more so as or </v>

247
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.273
<v Speaker 5>until the last year or so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always thought it'd be more as like </v>

248
00:11:29.751 --> 00:11:32.090
<v Speaker 5>social commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the bad stuff,</v>

249
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.073
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of the movies you've been in </v>

250
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:36.530
<v Speaker 5>seward,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more like personal social commentary.</v>

251
00:11:36.531 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever think you were going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>more in the political sphere?</v>

252
00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:40.970
<v Speaker 5>Because that's sort of where I put you </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

253
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.860
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

254
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.693
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not that insert myself in the political </v>

255
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:45.470
<v Speaker 5>sphere now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the last thing the world needs is</v>

256
00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:48.020
<v Speaker 5>another jerk off community spouting off </v>
<v Speaker 5>about politics.</v>

257
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't aspire to be that person,</v>

258
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.213
<v Speaker 5>but if I can set aside being a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just be a citizen who's interested </v>

259
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 5>in this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's sort of how I view myself.</v>

260
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely am not.</v>

261
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm not an activist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not marching.</v>

262
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.523
<v Speaker 5>I take no action.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do nothing other than I have this </v>

263
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:11.260
<v Speaker 5>twitter platform and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how I express myself politically.</v>

264
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 5>You do tweet while flying first class </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's the first time we had any</v>

265
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.233
<v Speaker 5>face to face interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going to go away in the back and </v>

266
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:22.090
<v Speaker 5>you sort of dismissively wave as it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>very.</v>

267
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 5>It was embarrassing for both of us as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>first class.</v>

268
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:26.764
<v Speaker 5>I've only flown first class once and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was on a little plane from Detroit to </v>

269
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:30.694
<v Speaker 5>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it was like eight people and I was </v>

270
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:33.700
<v Speaker 5>first class was just that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in the first seat.</v>

271
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't anything special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as a first class,</v>

272
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.750
<v Speaker 5>are you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel that we shouldn't be allowed</v>

273
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:38.584
<v Speaker 5>to look at you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always feel like when I'm walking </v>

274
00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:42.650
<v Speaker 5>through I shouldn't be allowed to learn </v>
<v Speaker 5>misunderstanding part.</v>

275
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the main Julia first class which </v>
<v Speaker 5>were seated first.</v>

276
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that.</v>

277
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:48.723
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people walking back are forced to </v>

278
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:55.291
<v Speaker 5>look at us already ensconced in our </v>
<v Speaker 5>blanket already ordering our beverage of</v>

279
00:12:56.351 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 5>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you're already asleep.</v>

280
00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.793
<v Speaker 5>Maybe getting massaged from the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's all kinds of things that </v>

281
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 5>it's important for the business model of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the airlines and for my own self esteem,</v>

282
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 5>they walking back to steroids that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>have that you do not.</v>

283
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.843
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting because I always </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought they should be one way glass so </v>

284
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:19.060
<v Speaker 5>that you could lock it us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that we have no desire to see you.</v>

285
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't exist for me.</v>

286
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.690
<v Speaker 5>Very much exist for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

287
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 5>You're thinking about those fuckers in </v>
<v Speaker 5>first class while you're crammed in.</v>

288
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 5>Starting little seat stewing for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>duration of your flight on that jet blue</v>

289
00:13:32.051 --> 00:13:32.890
<v Speaker 5>flight though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jet Blue,</v>

290
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 5>let's you get your own soda.</v>

291
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.833
<v Speaker 5>You know you can go to like a thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I was almost going to peek around the </v>

292
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 5>curtain and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

293
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:40.300
<v Speaker 5>they would know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or did you out?</v>

294
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.163
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I know you would've called people </v>

295
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:42.640
<v Speaker 5>and it would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would've been,</v>

296
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.430
<v Speaker 5>they would've landed us in Salt Lake </v>
<v Speaker 5>City or something.</v>

297
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.270
<v Speaker 5>It would've been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would've been a disaster.</v>

298
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.223
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad you didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad you had the foresight to know </v>

299
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 5>better than to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can Get.</v>

300
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 5>You would have been escorted out </v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately.</v>

301
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.530
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking of social,</v>

302
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.543
<v Speaker 5>full pause.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's move over to trump because you </v>

303
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:59.290
<v Speaker 5>have written a children's book about </v>
<v Speaker 5>trump.</v>

304
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.580
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you must love trump.</v>

305
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:05.540
<v Speaker 5>I assume if you wrote a children's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone loved children's books and um,</v>

306
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:11.670
<v Speaker 5>here's my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Despise trump wrote a book about trump,</v>

307
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sort of</v>

308
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.153
<v Speaker 6>a</v>

309
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.260
<v Speaker 5>kind of a children's book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a parody of a children's book,</v>

310
00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:22.730
<v Speaker 5>but it was a children's book at the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

311
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.073
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

312
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:30.290
<v Speaker 5>so I am exploiting the trump brand as </v>
<v Speaker 5>much as an actual trump and making money</v>

313
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.660
<v Speaker 5>off the trump brand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know.</v>

314
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:37.663
<v Speaker 5>So you're using it right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're using a trumpy and tactics on </v>

315
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.220
<v Speaker 5>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right,</v>

316
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.133
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where did the idea to make it a </v>

317
00:14:42.661 --> 00:14:44.370
<v Speaker 5>children's book come from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

318
00:14:44.371 --> 00:14:45.204
<v Speaker 5>I was at a bookstore and I saw a book </v>
<v Speaker 5>about Hillary Clinton as sort of a </v>

319
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:50.903
<v Speaker 5>children's book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a rags to riches story about Hillary </v>

320
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.940
<v Speaker 5>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and an inspirational tale started,</v>

321
00:14:54.941 --> 00:14:55.774
<v Speaker 5>I think at young girls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it made me chuckle a bit to think </v>

322
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:01.424
<v Speaker 5>about what that would be like if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>were to write about trump because he's </v>

323
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:07.100
<v Speaker 5>not an inspirational figure in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shape or form.</v>

324
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 5>He's just a toad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

325
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

326
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.580
<v Speaker 5>I just thought level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me try to do that.</v>

327
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.520
<v Speaker 5>So He's a toad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that why they're used?</v>

328
00:15:15.521 --> 00:15:16.760
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that toad thing?</v>

329
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.181
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

330
00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where did that come from?</v>

331
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.320
<v Speaker 5>I Know Kiki or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

332
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where there's a toad with </v>
<v Speaker 5>trump hair,</v>

333
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.010
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of toads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

334
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Speaker 5>On that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on that part of the Internet,</v>

335
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.090
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's with the Pto?</v>

336
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know.</v>

337
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:30.260
<v Speaker 5>We have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

338
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:32.840
<v Speaker 5>It took me long enough to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the three parentheses meant.</v>

339
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait.</v>

340
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 5>So the two?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

341
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:38.030
<v Speaker 5>it's three Jewish three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

342
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.661
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

343
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

344
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they came.</v>

345
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.113
<v Speaker 5>There were some list or something that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was exposed where they tried to expose </v>

346
00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 5>people to something like that came </v>
<v Speaker 5>later.</v>

347
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.730
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

348
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:50.000
<v Speaker 5>the three parentheses is meant to </v>
<v Speaker 5>indicate an echo,</v>

349
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.450
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

350
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.590
<v Speaker 5>and it's like the Jewish Echo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure quite what that means,</v>

351
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.020
<v Speaker 5>but that's what the three parentheses </v>
<v Speaker 5>are meant to indicate.</v>

352
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.940
<v Speaker 5>Is that just that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a nagging mother?</v>

353
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's something worse.</v>

354
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.540
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's far worse than that.</v>

355
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.793
<v Speaker 5>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there was an app that just </v>

356
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:10.670
<v Speaker 5>identified Jews for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

357
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>

358
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.693
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what do you make of just the general </v>

359
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.820
<v Speaker 5>climate right now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because to me,</v>

360
00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:19.340
<v Speaker 5>I've been off until this show and we did</v>
<v Speaker 5>one more.</v>

361
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 5>We'd launched relaunched last week and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

362
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.530
<v Speaker 5>for the three weeks that I took off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak,</v>

363
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 5>you can see the world not the world was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was paying attention.</v>

364
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:28.490
<v Speaker 5>I just didn't have a show to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

365
00:16:28.491 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 5>And it seems like the world went even </v>
<v Speaker 5>more crazy.</v>

366
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.190
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think the last month seems </v>
<v Speaker 5>like particularly nuts,</v>

367
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:36.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of starting probably with the pulse</v>

368
00:16:36.451 --> 00:16:37.770
<v Speaker 5>shooting and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

369
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

370
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.063
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm past the point of being surprised </v>

371
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:43.090
<v Speaker 5>that anything is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

372
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:48.410
<v Speaker 5>it all feels of a piece to me and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I can kind of grasp the outlines of</v>

373
00:16:48.411 --> 00:16:49.244
<v Speaker 5>what that piece is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the larger story is sort of </v>

374
00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:56.890
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is,</v>

375
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.780
<v Speaker 5>what is fueling all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

376
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.600
<v Speaker 5>and I think there's an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look,</v>

377
00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:02.434
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

378
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm not particularly savvy about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just regurgitating what I've read,</v>

379
00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:08.184
<v Speaker 5>but it really does feel like we're at a </v>
<v Speaker 5>moment where the foundations of </v>

380
00:17:18.031 --> 00:17:18.864
<v Speaker 5>capitalism are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are crumpling and nobody knows what to </v>

381
00:17:24.481 --> 00:17:25.314
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So is that the scary part that nobody </v>

382
00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:29.220
<v Speaker 5>knows what to because I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

383
00:17:29.221 --> 00:17:30.054
<v Speaker 5>It feels like something that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>real shift happening right now and it's </v>

384
00:17:34.351 --> 00:17:35.184
<v Speaker 5>almost like we have no leaders when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where even if you love trump and if you </v>

385
00:17:38.611 --> 00:17:41.310
<v Speaker 5>have loved Clinton and Obama is on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way out,</v>

386
00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:42.144
<v Speaker 5>but even if you love him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we don't have leaders who talk to </v>

387
00:17:44.491 --> 00:17:47.280
<v Speaker 5>us in an honest way and that that's part</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the problem.</v>

388
00:17:47.281 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 5>Like we're all walking around like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could somebody,</v>

389
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.480
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like everyone's looking around.</v>

390
00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Somebody help here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anyone we could look to for.</v>

391
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.373
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think trump understands the </v>

392
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.340
<v Speaker 4>problem better than the relative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the average citizen.</v>

393
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.050
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knows how to exploit it,</v>

394
00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.420
<v Speaker 4>but he'd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he understands it,</v>

395
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 4>but I agree with you that there is not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows,</v>

396
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:11.973
<v Speaker 4>sort of global leader has stepped </v>
<v Speaker 4>forward in a articulate non </v>

397
00:18:16.751 --> 00:18:19.840
<v Speaker 4>condescending way to say this is what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going through.</v>

398
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.433
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and here's where I think we need to </v>

399
00:18:23.471 --> 00:18:24.304
<v Speaker 4>move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be great if somebody would do </v>

400
00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:27.790
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd love for Hillary Clinton to spend an</v>

401
00:18:27.791 --> 00:18:30.880
<v Speaker 4>hour just talking into the camera and </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

402
00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:33.580
<v Speaker 4>this is where I think we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why I think we're here.</v>

403
00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.150
<v Speaker 4>This is where I think we need to go in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>very mature,</v>

404
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.270
<v Speaker 4>not alarmist way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you a hillary supporter?</v>

405
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.433
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I have the enthusiasm for </v>

406
00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:44.290
<v Speaker 4>Hillary that a lot of people have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is.</v>

407
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could just picture the gift right </v>

408
00:18:46.911 --> 00:18:47.421
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

409
00:18:47.421 --> 00:18:49.000
<v Speaker 2>are you a hillary supporter the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>way you got?</v>

410
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what everyone does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's like,</v>

411
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.680
<v Speaker 2>there's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>

412
00:18:51.681 --> 00:18:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everyone supporting hillary,</v>

413
00:18:54.231 --> 00:18:56.780
<v Speaker 2>my friends that had been democrats their</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life and family members.</v>

414
00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.733
<v Speaker 2>Are you supporting hillary?</v>

415
00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's good reason for that.</v>

416
00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 4>It was easy to gin up that enthusiasm </v>
<v Speaker 4>for Obama because as he himself said,</v>

417
00:19:08.171 --> 00:19:11.110
<v Speaker 4>he was a blank slate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary has a 20 5:30</v>

418
00:19:11.111 --> 00:19:11.944
<v Speaker 4>year record and it's very easy to cherry</v>
<v Speaker 4>pick what you like and Cherry pick what </v>

419
00:19:17.411 --> 00:19:20.230
<v Speaker 4>you don't like and say she's a villain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say she's a hero.</v>

420
00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.900
<v Speaker 4>She's a flawed human being as we all </v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

421
00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:27.580
<v Speaker 4>and we know what our flaws are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

422
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:28.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

423
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.483
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like getting back together with an </v>

424
00:19:30.401 --> 00:19:31.810
<v Speaker 4>old girlfriend or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

425
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.920
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still love her.</v>

426
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.913
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

427
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.873
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's going to be a pain in the </v>

428
00:19:38.861 --> 00:19:39.880
<v Speaker 4>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it.</v>

429
00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:41.890
<v Speaker 4>I still love her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

430
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.210
<v Speaker 4>that's Kinda what it's like.</v>

431
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.670
<v Speaker 2>So is that a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of dangerous thought though,</v>

432
00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:48.610
<v Speaker 2>because Obama came in with the blank </v>
<v Speaker 2>slate and whether you like him or not,</v>

433
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.693
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that we'd only be okay with </v>

434
00:19:50.741 --> 00:19:51.574
<v Speaker 2>blank slate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what sets the appeal of trump </v>

435
00:19:52.961 --> 00:19:53.794
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

436
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:54.843
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though his sleep actually is full </v>

437
00:19:56.591 --> 00:19:58.780
<v Speaker 2>of stuff again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you like it or not.</v>

438
00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Well it's full of political stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

439
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:02.310
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

440
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.480
<v Speaker 4>one hand races,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the other hand wrote,</v>

441
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.103
<v Speaker 4>he can be whatever you want him to be as</v>
<v Speaker 4>long as he's a racist because that's </v>

442
00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:10.680
<v Speaker 4>ultimately what people want from him.</v>

443
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.850
<v Speaker 2>So what do you make of the people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I get this part,</v>

444
00:20:13.851 --> 00:20:16.550
<v Speaker 2>here's my part of trump that I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually get,</v>

445
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.060
<v Speaker 2>forget all the policies for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do get the part about,</v>

446
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.310
<v Speaker 2>forget the policies because they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're all over the place.</v>

447
00:20:22.311 --> 00:20:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've even had,</v>

448
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I've had ardent trump supporters sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>here like Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>

449
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.450
<v Speaker 2>sit here and basically tell me it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the policies,</v>

450
00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:30.284
<v Speaker 2>it's about this one thing that I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell you and I at least get this </v>

451
00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:33.794
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that this is a cultural </v>

452
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.560
<v Speaker 2>election this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has almost nothing to do with policy.</v>

453
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.930
<v Speaker 2>But the one thing that he's getting with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

454
00:20:41.931 --> 00:20:42.764
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen this when I've been to </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges when liberals are coming up to </v>

455
00:20:45.291 --> 00:20:46.124
<v Speaker 2>me and saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's cracking this political </v>

456
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:50.050
<v Speaker 2>correctness thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

457
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.943
<v Speaker 2>The irony of that is I don't think he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be some major free speech </v>

458
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:55.420
<v Speaker 2>beacon because he talks about suing </v>
<v Speaker 2>reporters all the time,</v>

459
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:56.853
<v Speaker 2>but at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do get the level of people are </v>

460
00:20:58.781 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 2>feeling very repressed right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they can't say anything and they're</v>

461
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:05.890
<v Speaker 2>always screamed at in called racist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

462
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think you're with me out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

463
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

464
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.483
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

465
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:15.930
<v Speaker 4>when Milo talks about political </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctness,</v>

466
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 4>that term political correctness has come</v>
<v Speaker 4>to mean,</v>

467
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.440
<v Speaker 4>I think in those circles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

468
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 4>nativism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>racism,</v>

469
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.750
<v Speaker 4>xenophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what have you,</v>

470
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Speaker 4>when you say he's cracked political </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctness,</v>

471
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:39.480
<v Speaker 4>what he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's cracked is the,</v>

472
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.400
<v Speaker 4>the agreement that we had been coming to</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a society,</v>

473
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.070
<v Speaker 4>and that agreement was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

474
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.003
<v Speaker 4>diversity is a benefit to the nation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and tolerance is a benefit to the </v>

475
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:54.220
<v Speaker 4>nation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

476
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.113
<v Speaker 4>and having different points of view is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit to the nation that has all </v>

477
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:02.224
<v Speaker 4>gotten lumped into that agreement has </v>
<v Speaker 4>gotten lumped under political </v>

478
00:22:04.871 --> 00:22:05.704
<v Speaker 4>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when he says he's cracked political </v>

479
00:22:09.531 --> 00:22:10.970
<v Speaker 4>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's,</v>

480
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:11.953
<v Speaker 4>what I think he means is he has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's attempting to unravel that </v>

481
00:22:15.141 --> 00:22:20.141
<v Speaker 4>agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's left is white nationalism and</v>

482
00:22:21.111 --> 00:22:22.230
<v Speaker 4>nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

483
00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:27.340
<v Speaker 4>because trump's appeal is not policy </v>
<v Speaker 4>based.</v>

484
00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:31.780
<v Speaker 4>He has none.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not judgement based.</v>

485
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 4>He seems to have no better judgment than</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else in possibly worse.</v>

486
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.550
<v Speaker 4>It's not principle base.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has none.</v>

487
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 4>It's not character based.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has very little to none.</v>

488
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.790
<v Speaker 4>All he has is on day one starting with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexicans are rapists and whatever else.</v>

489
00:22:50.801 --> 00:22:55.801
<v Speaker 4>He said that's what he has and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>built on that from that spent his entire</v>

490
00:22:56.681 --> 00:23:01.681
<v Speaker 4>campaign has been a divisiveness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hatred geared towards angry white males.</v>

491
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

492
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:05.884
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love hearing your answer on that </v>

493
00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:08.130
<v Speaker 2>because obviously I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

494
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I like Milo and I've given him a </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform and you know,</v>

495
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 2>we work together and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the whole point of my show is that I</v>

496
00:23:13.301 --> 00:23:15.610
<v Speaker 2>want to hear that and I want to hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying.</v>

497
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I've watched your show,</v>

498
00:23:17.631 --> 00:23:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched him on it</v>

499
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.980
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a disgrace.</v>

500
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.713
<v Speaker 4>I think he's an utter disgrace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a feeling you're going to hear </v>

501
00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:31.200
<v Speaker 4>from him on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I very well might,</v>

502
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.610
<v Speaker 4>but he's not verified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

503
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

504
00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.653
<v Speaker 4>so at least it starts there and it feels</v>
<v Speaker 4>very calculated and it feels very </v>

505
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.040
<v Speaker 4>machiavellian to me and it feels very </v>
<v Speaker 4>put on and it and it,</v>

506
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:46.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

507
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.740
<v Speaker 5>and he is allowing himself to be used,</v>

508
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.910
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

509
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.450
<v Speaker 3>a tool by a,</v>

510
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:00.790
<v Speaker 5>the intolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

511
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.890
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that he's gay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

512
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

513
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.550
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

514
00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.580
<v Speaker 5>makes it all the more appalling to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

515
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.230
<v Speaker 5>because he's giving them more license to</v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

516
00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:16.310
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we like this guy,</v>

517
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we like this crazy Brit,</v>

518
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.930
<v Speaker 5>this crazy flaming red or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

519
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.840
<v Speaker 5>and that is,</v>

520
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 5>I think it unconscionable use of moral </v>
<v Speaker 5>licensing and that he's allowing himself</v>

521
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 5>to be used in that way and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and promoting himself in that way.</v>

522
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.820
<v Speaker 5>Moral licensing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that.</v>

523
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.240
<v Speaker 5>You just come up with that right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That that's something somebody said that</v>

524
00:24:38.241 --> 00:24:39.650
<v Speaker 5>before I learned it from Malcolm </v>
<v Speaker 5>Gladwell.</v>

525
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.071
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

526
00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:41.720
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a moralizing.</v>

527
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.780
<v Speaker 5>So I guess part of this is that our </v>
<v Speaker 5>system is just so broke that anyone that</v>

528
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:48.374
<v Speaker 5>had a moral license or a moral compass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you ever want to run for </v>

529
00:24:51.981 --> 00:24:52.641
<v Speaker 5>president?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

530
00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:54.380
<v Speaker 5>could you imagine as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a,</v>

531
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.880
<v Speaker 5>as a smart person ever wanting to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself in politics at all?</v>

532
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.080
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

533
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.173
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that the bigger problem here that </v>

534
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Speaker 5>we're just getting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're just getting what we've created,</v>

535
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:06.914
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

536
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.373
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

537
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.940
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have any,</v>

538
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.870
<v Speaker 5>if you've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you've lived any kind of life,</v>

539
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.120
<v Speaker 5>hemingway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

540
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:21.643
<v Speaker 5>whoever those guys could not run for </v>
<v Speaker 5>office or anybody who's lived a life </v>

541
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.060
<v Speaker 5>that has any</v>

542
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.470
<v Speaker 5>human experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

543
00:25:30.471 --> 00:25:32.240
<v Speaker 5>So meaning you might have cheated on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your wife,</v>

544
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:34.060
<v Speaker 5>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you might need some coke.</v>

545
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.010
<v Speaker 5>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

546
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.580
<v Speaker 5>He might've done any number of things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that make us human,</v>

547
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.880
<v Speaker 5>make us flawed human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

548
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 5>that stuff's going to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

549
00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be vilified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

550
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:46.640
<v Speaker 5>So if you're thinking about running for </v>
<v Speaker 5>office,</v>

551
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:47.503
<v Speaker 5>somebody like Ted Cruz for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's been thinking about being </v>

552
00:25:49.401 --> 00:25:50.234
<v Speaker 5>president his entire fucking life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's lived his life in such a way to </v>

553
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:58.961
<v Speaker 5>make his resume the resume of a future </v>
<v Speaker 5>president or at very least a senator.</v>

554
00:25:59.511 --> 00:26:01.890
<v Speaker 5>You're not exaggerating by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no video of him at like 16.</v>

555
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.010
<v Speaker 5>So I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna be president.</v>

556
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:04.893
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

557
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.120
<v Speaker 5>and so you live your life in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 5>is calculatedly</v>

558
00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:16.110
<v Speaker 5>unrelatable to the rest of the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

559
00:26:16.111 --> 00:26:16.944
<v Speaker 5>someone like Bill Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who I think probably was running for </v>

560
00:26:19.741 --> 00:26:23.640
<v Speaker 5>president his whole life too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least he,</v>

561
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
<v Speaker 5>he wears his humanity on his sleeve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

562
00:26:27.001 --> 00:26:27.834
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

563
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm just a big goober.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

564
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:35.030
<v Speaker 5>and that's part of his appeal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can't imagine subjecting myself to</v>

565
00:26:35.731 --> 00:26:38.220
<v Speaker 5>the kind of public scrutiny that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>required,</v>

566
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:42.330
<v Speaker 5>knowing that there's people whose job is</v>
<v Speaker 5>to dig up shit on you,</v>

567
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.193
<v Speaker 5>just about your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has nothing to do with your ability </v>

568
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.830
<v Speaker 5>to make good policy decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

569
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.920
<v Speaker 5>What does it tell you that when a show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was the show with Kevin Spacey?</v>

570
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:54.840
<v Speaker 5>It's been blank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how's the cards?</v>

571
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:56.820
<v Speaker 5>I watch house of cards and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

572
00:26:56.821 --> 00:27:00.900
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot more reality in that then </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything that I'm watching on CNN,</v>

573
00:27:00.901 --> 00:27:01.734
<v Speaker 5>meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the CNN people are pretending to be </v>

574
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

575
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:04.681
<v Speaker 5>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way.</v>

576
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:07.640
<v Speaker 5>Do you wait?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you like that bugs me.</v>

577
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.820
<v Speaker 5>Drives me fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wha.</v>

578
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.273
<v Speaker 5>What movie was I watching just these </v>
<v Speaker 5>past couple days ago I was watching one </v>

579
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:14.424
<v Speaker 5>of the unjust,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some superhero movie and it's like jake </v>

580
00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:19.980
<v Speaker 5>tapper shows every since it was dot who </v>
<v Speaker 5>I like.</v>

581
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.050
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

582
00:27:21.051 --> 00:27:22.740
<v Speaker 5>What movie was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Superhero movies.</v>

583
00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:23.574
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Batman.</v>

584
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.080
<v Speaker 5>Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Superman.</v>

585
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:26.180
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it was jake actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

586
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.170
<v Speaker 5>it was Anderson Cooper in that when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

587
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.240
<v Speaker 5>you guys are all pretending to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourselves.</v>

588
00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:33.180
<v Speaker 5>Why can't we have alternate universes </v>
<v Speaker 5>where there are also,</v>

589
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.750
<v Speaker 5>we can have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kryptonite will also have alternate news</v>

590
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:37.840
<v Speaker 5>casters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't even hit journalist,</v>

591
00:27:37.841 --> 00:27:41.970
<v Speaker 5>but journalists don't show up in Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

592
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:44.490
<v Speaker 5>But doesn't mad show it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they all want to be stars.</v>

593
00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:45.324
<v Speaker 5>So when I say this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably with some do irony to </v>

594
00:27:47.581 --> 00:27:49.980
<v Speaker 5>people that are public people and share </v>
<v Speaker 5>our opinions,</v>

595
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.040
<v Speaker 5>but it's like they all want to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

596
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:54.720
<v Speaker 5>They go to the White House </v>
<v Speaker 5>correspondence dinner.</v>

597
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.793
<v Speaker 5>They all want to have dinner with these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and go to the parties and all </v>

598
00:27:58.081 --> 00:27:59.100
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's to me,</v>

599
00:27:59.101 --> 00:28:00.720
<v Speaker 5>one of the biggest problems we have in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole country.</v>

600
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:01.290
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

601
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:01.811
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

602
00:28:01.811 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 5>the political starfucking I guess I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't really have a problem with it.</v>

603
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

604
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:08.443
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't upset me maybe the way that </v>

605
00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:14.981
<v Speaker 5>it upsets you because I do feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in any profession,</v>

606
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.600
<v Speaker 5>most people in any given profession are </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to do a good job.</v>

607
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:23.983
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like when I see Anderson Cooper </v>

608
00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:29.354
<v Speaker 5>reporting on something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like most of the time he's done </v>

609
00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:31.490
<v Speaker 5>pretty good job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

610
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.080
<v Speaker 5>I think he's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

611
00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.350
<v Speaker 5>Chuck Todd who I think can be a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>supercilious,</v>

612
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.110
<v Speaker 5>but I think he's trying to do a good job</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think he's doing.</v>

613
00:28:39.111 --> 00:28:39.944
<v Speaker 5>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he approaches things the way he </v>

614
00:28:41.301 --> 00:28:42.820
<v Speaker 5>approaches them for very specific </v>
<v Speaker 5>reason.</v>

615
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.873
<v Speaker 5>It's thought it's thought it's thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>out jake tapper the same way and you </v>

616
00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:48.434
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these guys will land punches that kind </v>

617
00:28:52.191 --> 00:28:53.660
<v Speaker 5>of meshing of</v>

618
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.620
<v Speaker 5>politicos and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and journalists.</v>

619
00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:58.420
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't really upset me because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>seems like,</v>

620
00:28:58.421 --> 00:28:59.254
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're a journalist you want to have </v>

621
00:28:59.981 --> 00:29:02.320
<v Speaker 5>relationships with these people to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>

622
00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:03.243
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess for me the bigger problem is </v>

623
00:29:04.151 --> 00:29:07.810
<v Speaker 5>that if you ask easy questions and look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm an interviewer,</v>

624
00:29:07.811 --> 00:29:11.230
<v Speaker 5>so if you ask any questions you're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get them to come back.</v>

625
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.243
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if I had Obama here one time and I </v>

626
00:29:14.261 --> 00:29:15.094
<v Speaker 5>knew this is the one time that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll set up the rest of our </v>

627
00:29:16.991 --> 00:29:17.824
<v Speaker 5>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I would attack him in a </v>

628
00:29:19.541 --> 00:29:20.374
<v Speaker 5>way that I might the second time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even in that that causes a problem </v>

629
00:29:22.991 --> 00:29:24.850
<v Speaker 5>because then they always go at a press </v>
<v Speaker 5>conference are always like,</v>

630
00:29:24.851 --> 00:29:27.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh guy who I know I get easy questions </v>
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>

631
00:29:27.191 --> 00:29:27.970
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

632
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.120
<v Speaker 5>But there's a way to have that </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>

633
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.253
<v Speaker 5>Have a tough conversation with him or </v>
<v Speaker 5>with anybody in a way that he doesn't </v>

634
00:29:36.081 --> 00:29:37.430
<v Speaker 5>feel attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can.</v>

635
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:41.530
<v Speaker 5>I think most politicians are receptive </v>
<v Speaker 5>to being asked</v>

636
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.160
<v Speaker 4>tough questions in a respectful way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought Jon Stewart was.</v>

637
00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:46.043
<v Speaker 4>He was a master at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jon Stewart would have any conservative </v>

638
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:50.703
<v Speaker 4>on his show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would read their book and he would </v>

639
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 4>grill them about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was always respectful and I think</v>

640
00:29:55.901 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 4>as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would come on the show because they</v>

641
00:29:57.851 --> 00:30:00.550
<v Speaker 4>knew they would get a fair hearing for </v>
<v Speaker 4>their ideas.</v>

642
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Then they may end up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they may have,</v>

643
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 4>they may walk out feeling foolish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not because of him.</v>

644
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.204
<v Speaker 4>It's because of them.</v>

645
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we do,</v>

646
00:30:08.571 --> 00:30:10.490
<v Speaker 2>do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make people smarter?</v>

647
00:30:10.491 --> 00:30:11.324
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep saying that being smart is now </v>

648
00:30:13.161 --> 00:30:13.994
<v Speaker 2>counter culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Culture is dumb right now and when I </v>

649
00:30:16.551 --> 00:30:17.840
<v Speaker 2>meet smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

650
00:30:17.841 --> 00:30:18.650
<v Speaker 2>thank God.</v>

651
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.900
<v Speaker 4>Culture is gleefully dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem.</v>

652
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.713
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that as a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're probably smarter than we've ever </v>

653
00:30:25.401 --> 00:30:26.600
<v Speaker 4>been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

654
00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:31.660
<v Speaker 4>There's this attitude that book learning</v>
<v Speaker 4>is somehow anti-american.</v>

655
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.800
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge is suspect.</v>

656
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.260
<v Speaker 4>Science is political.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

657
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.960
<v Speaker 4>it's very much an up is down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>down is up kind of world.</v>

658
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.570
<v Speaker 4>But I still think that's a,</v>

659
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.080
<v Speaker 2>that's a minority of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

660
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.900
<v Speaker 2>of the country that really believes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

661
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

662
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:54.203
<v Speaker 2>I firmly believe it's a minority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the minority that we keep </v>

663
00:30:56.261 --> 00:30:57.290
<v Speaker 2>hearing from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

664
00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.900
<v Speaker 2>that's what I keep saying to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political side.</v>

665
00:30:58.901 --> 00:31:02.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like we hear from the crazies on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left and we hear from the crazies on</v>

666
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:05.230
<v Speaker 2>the right and I would argue that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

667
00:31:05.231 --> 00:31:06.064
<v Speaker 2>I think really 80 percent of us actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>want pretty decent things and pretty </v>

668
00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:12.230
<v Speaker 2>similar things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're a,</v>

669
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.473
<v Speaker 2>if you're just a regular conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want a world that's very </v>

670
00:31:16.211 --> 00:31:18.430
<v Speaker 2>different from what the average liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>really want.</v>

671
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.290
<v Speaker 2>You might have a couple of policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do we,</v>

672
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.390
<v Speaker 2>how do we get those voices to be heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>

673
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.253
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one thing I think it's important to </v>

674
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.560
<v Speaker 2>to for the larger</v>

675
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:32.030
<v Speaker 4>a national dialogue to state what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just stated,</v>

676
00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.180
<v Speaker 4>which is true and I would say it's even </v>
<v Speaker 4>larger than 80 percent.</v>

677
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:38.960
<v Speaker 4>We all essentially want the same things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want safe communities,</v>

678
00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.003
<v Speaker 4>we want opportunities for our kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We wanted the ability to make a little </v>

679
00:31:43.251 --> 00:31:48.251
<v Speaker 4>money and feel like if we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to use the tritus political expression,</v>

680
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.040
<v Speaker 4>work hard and play by the rules will get</v>
<v Speaker 4>ahead.</v>

681
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.530
<v Speaker 4>That's basically all people want right </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

682
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.423
<v Speaker 4>on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if conservatives can agree with that </v>

683
00:31:59.151 --> 00:32:00.680
<v Speaker 4>statement and Liberals can agree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that statement,</v>

684
00:32:00.681 --> 00:32:01.514
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>

685
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.353
<v Speaker 4>we know where we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really just a question of tactics </v>

686
00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:06.350
<v Speaker 4>on how we get there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where we disagree.</v>

687
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.720
<v Speaker 4>But as long as we keep in mind that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>goal is the same,</v>

688
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.520
<v Speaker 4>I think we can work together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we become so,</v>

689
00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:18.730
<v Speaker 4>and this is largely a result of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of uh,</v>

690
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.180
<v Speaker 4>at the entertainment aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 4>journalism,</v>

691
00:32:21.181 --> 00:32:22.014
<v Speaker 4>we become so polarized because that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what drives eyeballs to television </v>

692
00:32:23.881 --> 00:32:24.714
<v Speaker 4>screens is people yelling at each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to people having comity and </v>

693
00:32:27.181 --> 00:32:27.781
<v Speaker 4>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

694
00:32:27.781 --> 00:32:29.670
<v Speaker 4>we agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We basically agree,</v>

695
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

696
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:35.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's the irony is people want </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

697
00:32:35.581 --> 00:32:36.414
<v Speaker 2>I know they want to because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>messaging me every day saying that what </v>

698
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:42.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm here is what they want to see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that you're important,</v>

699
00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.270
<v Speaker 2>you're doing God's work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get it.</v>

700
00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

701
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:47.583
<v Speaker 2>if 100 other people were doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would gladly find something else to </v>

702
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

703
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:51.464
<v Speaker 2>I really would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would show a good sign that </v>

704
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 2>some smarter things have had occurred </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

705
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:56.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That I,</v>

706
00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.383
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

707
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 4>I wrote a book a few years ago with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend,</v>

708
00:32:59.451 --> 00:33:00.740
<v Speaker 4>Megan Mckenna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to ask you about that.</v>

709
00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:01.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

710
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.120
<v Speaker 4>and that was essentially the central </v>
<v Speaker 4>thesis of the book,</v>

711
00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:06.920
<v Speaker 4>which is we all kind of want the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

712
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:11.540
<v Speaker 4>We differ on the margins may be a bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>about guns for example.</v>

713
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:12.863
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even then we don't because </v>

714
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 4>conservatives and liberals both want gun</v>
<v Speaker 4>debts to fall.</v>

715
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.053
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a question of how we get </v>

716
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:21.794
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain disingenuousness I </v>

717
00:33:25.251 --> 00:33:26.084
<v Speaker 4>think on the part of the right about how</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get there and in fact entirely </v>

718
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:32.070
<v Speaker 4>disingenuousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just from a,</v>

719
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.210
<v Speaker 4>from a purely philosophical point of </v>
<v Speaker 4>view,</v>

720
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.980
<v Speaker 4>both sides would like to reduce gun </v>
<v Speaker 4>deaths.</v>

721
00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then it's just how do we get there?</v>

722
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:42.630
<v Speaker 2>So when you wrote that book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's actually when I had you on my</v>

723
00:33:42.631 --> 00:33:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Sirius xm show many lifetimes ago when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you wrote that,</v>

724
00:33:45.871 --> 00:33:48.330
<v Speaker 2>and I think I had megan on maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next week or something.</v>

725
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what made you think like,</v>

726
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.933
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should talk to her because she's </v>

727
00:33:52.111 --> 00:33:52.944
<v Speaker 2>obviously she's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her Dad's a pretty powerful guy who ran </v>

728
00:33:55.981 --> 00:33:59.290
<v Speaker 2>for president and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's on the right and I do continue.</v>

729
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you consider yourself on the left?</v>

730
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.470
<v Speaker 2>You just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

731
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:02.340
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

732
00:34:02.341 --> 00:34:03.240
<v Speaker 2>what made you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

733
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.860
<v Speaker 2>this is the apprentice ears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to do that.</v>

734
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.850
<v Speaker 2>A couple more parentheses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

735
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:09.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

736
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:10.403
<v Speaker 2>What made you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me talk to her and let's do this </v>

737
00:34:12.061 --> 00:34:13.920
<v Speaker 2>because that was ahead of its.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

738
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the reason it was.</v>

739
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.140
<v Speaker 4>She's somebody who I should have very </v>
<v Speaker 4>little in common with.</v>

740
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:19.003
<v Speaker 4>Let's go on the road together and write </v>
<v Speaker 4>a book and see if we can sort of bring </v>

741
00:34:22.521 --> 00:34:27.380
<v Speaker 4>these issues to light a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we did a,</v>

742
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 4>it was fun and we wrote a good book and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody bought it.</v>

743
00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to hear more similar than </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissimilar.</v>

744
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a dangerous.</v>

745
00:34:37.031 --> 00:34:37.864
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing I want to unpack with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this more than anything else is like </v>

746
00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:42.960
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get past it and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

747
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.111
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

748
00:34:44.111 --> 00:34:44.944
<v Speaker 2>I turn on CNN and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think they're watching news and </v>

749
00:34:47.141 --> 00:34:50.890
<v Speaker 2>they're not watching news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are literally watching Wolf Blitzer</v>

750
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:51.963
<v Speaker 2>debate between the trump spokesman and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hillary spokesmen and people think that </v>

751
00:34:54.971 --> 00:34:55.804
<v Speaker 2>that's news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile brexit happens and we don't </v>

752
00:34:57.761 --> 00:34:58.720
<v Speaker 2>even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We literally,</v>

753
00:34:58.721 --> 00:34:59.554
<v Speaker 2>I watched CNN almost a full day just </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to see like what are they going </v>

754
00:35:01.811 --> 00:35:03.520
<v Speaker 2>to show us with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto the background.</v>

755
00:35:03.521 --> 00:35:04.690
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know the audio on the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

756
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:09.460
<v Speaker 2>but like there was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was like one 32nd thing every four</v>

757
00:35:09.461 --> 00:35:10.120
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

758
00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.580
<v Speaker 2>So it's like our media is just making </v>
<v Speaker 2>this dumb too.</v>

759
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:15.810
<v Speaker 7>Yes</v>

760
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:16.643
<v Speaker 4>and no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a certain percentage of </v>

761
00:35:18.721 --> 00:35:23.721
<v Speaker 4>the population that will look at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>coverage of brexit and be curious enough</v>

762
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.033
<v Speaker 4>to want to understand more what that </v>
<v Speaker 4>means and there's a much larger </v>

763
00:35:29.611 --> 00:35:30.444
<v Speaker 4>percentage of the population that </v>
<v Speaker 4>understands the headline of what Brexit </v>

764
00:35:34.231 --> 00:35:36.600
<v Speaker 4>is and doesn't need to pursue that any </v>
<v Speaker 4>further.</v>

765
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a certain amount of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>population who doesn't give a shit,</v>

766
00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.830
<v Speaker 4>but I put it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it hasn't.</v>

767
00:35:43.831 --> 00:35:45.900
<v Speaker 4>That always been the way I've always </v>
<v Speaker 4>been the case,</v>

768
00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:47.200
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>

769
00:35:47.201 --> 00:35:48.410
<v Speaker 4>that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

770
00:35:48.411 --> 00:35:49.520
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

771
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:50.503
<v Speaker 4>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like we're more engaged as a </v>

772
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:56.361
<v Speaker 4>nation than we've ever been on almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we can't help but be the.</v>

773
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:57.503
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what's going on in the country </v>

774
00:36:00.211 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

775
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:01.733
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely a pollyanna ish way </v>
<v Speaker 4>of looking at it and saying this is </v>

776
00:36:04.651 --> 00:36:06.090
<v Speaker 4>actually quite good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's happening.</v>

777
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.950
<v Speaker 4>That there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

778
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:10.170
<v Speaker 4>aside from people just being gone down </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the streets,</v>

779
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.423
<v Speaker 4>which is great.</v>

780
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.653
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

781
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.410
<v Speaker 2>so you're saying that the issues that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are being earthed up are good.</v>

782
00:36:17.411 --> 00:36:18.244
<v Speaker 2>The question is yes</v>

783
00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.750
<v Speaker 4>or being dredged up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

784
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.180
<v Speaker 4>Aren't necessarily issues.</v>

785
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.513
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

786
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.793
<v Speaker 4>and they're being brought to the fore by</v>
<v Speaker 4>two imperfect messengers and that's </v>

787
00:36:28.851 --> 00:36:30.350
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>

788
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as we're taping this right now,</v>

789
00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:37.050
<v Speaker 2>black lives matters in the throes of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of stuff going on.</v>

790
00:36:37.051 --> 00:36:37.884
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the shootings of the black </v>

791
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:42.930
<v Speaker 2>people that has obviously been going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>for quite some time up,</v>

792
00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.800
<v Speaker 2>but these last few in particular and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

793
00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:46.663
<v Speaker 2>the bride or the protests against it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the cop shootings and everything </v>

794
00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:53.010
<v Speaker 2>else where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you kind of fall on all of this</v>

795
00:36:53.011 --> 00:36:53.844
<v Speaker 2>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I find it very hard and even </v>

796
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.633
<v Speaker 2>even as I'm prefacing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that no matter what we say right </v>

797
00:36:58.531 --> 00:36:59.364
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of people are going to </v>

798
00:37:00.541 --> 00:37:01.051
<v Speaker 2>hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

799
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:01.884
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if they agree with us on 99 </v>

800
00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:05.160
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we say one word the wrong way,</v>

801
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.710
<v Speaker 2>people will start freaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>

802
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:08.603
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't talked about it that much </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I find it's very hard to </v>

803
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:16.350
<v Speaker 2>decipher what's actually happening by </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching little clips of things.</v>

804
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.393
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

805
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.350
<v Speaker 4>there's a few things we know that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

806
00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.253
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's start with the black lives matter </v>

807
00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.053
<v Speaker 4>side of it and instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think these are two opposing </v>

808
00:37:27.281 --> 00:37:28.510
<v Speaker 4>sides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just,</v>

809
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:29.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>separating them out.</v>

810
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.100
<v Speaker 4>We know that black people are being </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed by police.</v>

811
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:35.770
<v Speaker 4>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've known it for years.</v>

812
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.780
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've known it for generations,</v>

813
00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:40.990
<v Speaker 4>we've known him for centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Black people get killed.</v>

814
00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:46.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what changed is obviously the ability to</v>

815
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:51.460
<v Speaker 4>live stream those debts as they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>occurring.</v>

816
00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:52.653
<v Speaker 4>It has changed the dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard for white people to now </v>

817
00:37:57.881 --> 00:37:59.130
<v Speaker 4>say or not to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

818
00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:01.090
<v Speaker 4>to live in any kind of denial about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

819
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.983
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see the evidence presented in </v>

820
00:38:04.571 --> 00:38:09.340
<v Speaker 4>front of you and there's a lot of white </v>
<v Speaker 4>people trying very hard to maintain that</v>

821
00:38:09.341 --> 00:38:10.720
<v Speaker 4>denial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very hard,</v>

822
00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:13.240
<v Speaker 4>but I think most of us look at that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

823
00:38:13.241 --> 00:38:14.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

824
00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:18.190
<v Speaker 4>we knew what you were saying for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>last 300 years,</v>

825
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

826
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The blatant denial people are the ones </v>

827
00:38:21.061 --> 00:38:21.894
<v Speaker 2>that drive me nuts because you can say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can get to the other part of </v>

828
00:38:24.121 --> 00:38:24.954
<v Speaker 2>this too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say there's some legitimate </v>

829
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.753
<v Speaker 2>issues there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the people that no matter what </v>

830
00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:30.750
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what evidence they're shown,</v>

831
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:31.783
<v Speaker 2>they immediately go to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes to character assassination </v>

832
00:38:33.661 --> 00:38:34.530
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

833
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:35.861
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

834
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

835
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.040
<v Speaker 4>If somebody had a weed in the car or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

836
00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:40.830
<v Speaker 4>well they deserve to get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

837
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:42.363
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't.</v>

838
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.243
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's that side of it and then the </v>

839
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:47.374
<v Speaker 4>other side is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that violence gets redirected towards </v>

840
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.240
<v Speaker 4>police and I haven't heard anybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>defend that in any way,</v>

841
00:38:57.431 --> 00:38:58.264
<v Speaker 4>shape or form other than a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy people on twitter just being </v>

842
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.453
<v Speaker 4>idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The two on the two ideas are not </v>

843
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.063
<v Speaker 4>opposed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't be killing people like </v>

844
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:14.763
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just start with that central </v>

845
00:39:15.191 --> 00:39:17.680
<v Speaker 4>premise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are dying unnecessarily.</v>

846
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:22.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there I believe that there is a uh,</v>

847
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.840
<v Speaker 4>incredibly entrenched,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

848
00:39:31.621 --> 00:39:36.621
<v Speaker 4>and there's no polite word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Racist Culture in police culture.</v>

849
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.043
<v Speaker 4>I've seen enough evidence and read </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough account and spent enough time </v>

850
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.980
<v Speaker 4>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at,</v>

851
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.740
<v Speaker 4>added into it to suggest that that is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>

852
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:54.660
<v Speaker 4>a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a genuine problem.</v>

853
00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:56.243
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for probably a plethora of historical </v>

854
00:40:01.171 --> 00:40:02.004
<v Speaker 4>and cultural reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So something's broken with policing and </v>

855
00:40:08.251 --> 00:40:11.790
<v Speaker 4>I think always has been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now we're just seeing it.</v>

856
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that needs to change.</v>

857
00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:15.943
<v Speaker 6>Hm.</v>

858
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.133
<v Speaker 4>The idea that the police force,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've come to think of more and more as </v>

859
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 4>a militarized force as an extension of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the military.</v>

860
00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 4>That has to change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

861
00:40:26.051 --> 00:40:27.070
<v Speaker 4>It's weird that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry to cut you off,</v>

862
00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:28.390
<v Speaker 4>but it's weird that people don't see </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

863
00:40:28.391 --> 00:40:31.810
<v Speaker 4>That piece of it where when we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>these tanks out there are not taxed,</v>

864
00:40:31.811 --> 00:40:34.210
<v Speaker 4>but these armored vehicles on our </v>
<v Speaker 4>streets,</v>

865
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:35.680
<v Speaker 4>it happened and that doesn't truly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

866
00:40:35.681 --> 00:40:37.960
<v Speaker 4>and that doesn't feel like if you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>just looking at it,</v>

867
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:42.040
<v Speaker 4>we're moving specifics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We armored tanks on our streets,</v>

868
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:45.070
<v Speaker 4>forget why they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that in and of itself,</v>

869
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.090
<v Speaker 4>this alarm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a problem.</v>

870
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:47.283
<v Speaker 4>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should have to call the national </v>

871
00:40:47.891 --> 00:40:52.891
<v Speaker 4>guard tank and pick up the phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gomer pyle haven't bring the tank.</v>

872
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.050
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason the police forces need</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

873
00:40:56.051 --> 00:41:01.051
<v Speaker 4>but what it does is it inculcates an us </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus them mentality,</v>

874
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:03.843
<v Speaker 4>both from the police point of view and </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the community's point of view and </v>

875
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:09.970
<v Speaker 4>the idea of community policing is lost.</v>

876
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:14.970
<v Speaker 4>The idea of to protect and serve is lost</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's become a a.</v>

877
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.543
<v Speaker 4>The the these police precincts I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>in many communities have come to feel </v>

878
00:41:22.031 --> 00:41:25.360
<v Speaker 4>like occupying forces as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>extensions of the community.</v>

879
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.073
<v Speaker 4>That's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that the fact that police </v>

880
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 4>routinely recruit from the military I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think is a problem.</v>

881
00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:33.930
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

882
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.140
<v Speaker 4>there's no real linkage between those </v>
<v Speaker 4>two organizations.</v>

883
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.260
<v Speaker 4>The police are paramilitary to a certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>extent,</v>

884
00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:46.850
<v Speaker 4>but the local police force in my mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be essentially liaison from,</v>

885
00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the law,</v>

886
00:41:52.921 --> 00:41:56.220
<v Speaker 4>law enforcement to the community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it should be a partnership.</v>

887
00:41:56.221 --> 00:41:57.510
<v Speaker 4>It should be a two way street.</v>

888
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:58.363
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in army is dealing with enemy </v>

889
00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:00.164
<v Speaker 2>combatants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by definite way that police </v>

890
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:03.140
<v Speaker 2>obviously she's right there,</v>

891
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.750
<v Speaker 4>like definition and army is dealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

892
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.830
<v Speaker 4>with an opposing force.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

893
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.980
<v Speaker 4>And when you recruit from the military </v>
<v Speaker 4>to fill out your police ranks,</v>

894
00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:17.493
<v Speaker 4>I have a hard time believing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to bring that </v>

895
00:42:18.491 --> 00:42:22.780
<v Speaker 4>mentality to policing and it infects the</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire culture.</v>

896
00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.150
<v Speaker 4>And it's been that way now for I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>decades.</v>

897
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:26.103
<v Speaker 2>So what do you make of [inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've struggled </v>

898
00:42:27.701 --> 00:42:28.534
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I see the protests and </v>

899
00:42:29.321 --> 00:42:30.154
<v Speaker 2>there in the middle of the street where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not supposed to be on highways </v>

900
00:42:31.811 --> 00:42:32.644
<v Speaker 2>and things and you know when they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been burning cars or whatever it is or </v>

901
00:42:36.671 --> 00:42:38.290
<v Speaker 2>or looting sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

902
00:42:38.291 --> 00:42:40.450
<v Speaker 2>those things are not legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to protest,</v>

903
00:42:40.451 --> 00:42:42.640
<v Speaker 2>but you can't shut down highways and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

904
00:42:42.641 --> 00:42:43.474
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and usually the cop usually not always </v>

905
00:42:45.701 --> 00:42:46.534
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but usually you see the cops basically </v>

906
00:42:48.881 --> 00:42:53.170
<v Speaker 2>trying to keep law and order so it sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a self fulfilling prophecy here,</v>

907
00:42:53.171 --> 00:42:54.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you could.</v>

908
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.123
<v Speaker 2>You create something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do something illegal even if the </v>

909
00:42:57.731 --> 00:42:58.850
<v Speaker 2>intentions are good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

910
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:59.703
<v Speaker 2>Your motives are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you shut down a highway which you </v>

911
00:43:01.631 --> 00:43:02.590
<v Speaker 2>can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

912
00:43:02.591 --> 00:43:03.424
<v Speaker 2>The cops have to do something and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've created this stalemate here and </v>

913
00:43:07.211 --> 00:43:08.044
<v Speaker 2>now of course everyone's got cameras in </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's face and they're just </v>

914
00:43:09.851 --> 00:43:11.450
<v Speaker 2>waiting for the pin drops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

915
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.300
<v Speaker 2>To set the whole thing off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do we,</v>

916
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:14.830
<v Speaker 2>how do we unfurl some of that?</v>

917
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:16.263
<v Speaker 4>This is given two different examples </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I think are not quite the same to </v>

918
00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:24.700
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a big difference between sitting</v>

919
00:43:24.701 --> 00:43:28.420
<v Speaker 4>down in the middle of a highway and </v>
<v Speaker 4>burning a car and looting a store.</v>

920
00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.310
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But both are legal.</v>

921
00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:31.293
<v Speaker 4>Both are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is causing a property damage and </v>

922
00:43:37.691 --> 00:43:39.000
<v Speaker 4>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is,</v>

923
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:39.943
<v Speaker 4>is essentially a violent act versus the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonviolent protest of sitting down in </v>

924
00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:44.680
<v Speaker 4>the middle of a highway.</v>

925
00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:46.803
<v Speaker 2>You could be stopping ambulances that </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to get in all kinds of other </v>

926
00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:51.160
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could also do those sit downs</v>

927
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.490
<v Speaker 4>in a park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

928
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

929
00:43:53.541 --> 00:43:55.340
<v Speaker 4>but you don't get the fanfare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

930
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.460
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and protest is about spectacle.</v>

931
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.380
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is it's point.</v>

932
00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:01.773
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I may be annoyed at the people </v>

933
00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:11.740
<v Speaker 4>sitting in the middle of the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

934
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.053
<v Speaker 4>but I don't have the same reaction to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as I do to people being </v>

935
00:44:14.951 --> 00:44:16.160
<v Speaker 4>destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

936
00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:19.380
<v Speaker 4>In their community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think I,</v>

937
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:20.583
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think sitting down in the highways a </v>

938
00:44:22.601 --> 00:44:27.601
<v Speaker 4>perfectly viable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a nonviolent demonstration where I think</v>

939
00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.840
<v Speaker 4>black lives matter is falling short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

940
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.610
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

941
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:39.260
<v Speaker 4>I was reading a commenter commentator on</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter,</v>

942
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.530
<v Speaker 4>Oliver Willis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was talking about this all night</v>

943
00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:42.403
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible]</v>

944
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:49.160
<v Speaker 4>without a directed legislative agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so much smoke,</v>

945
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.450
<v Speaker 4>but there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can't catch fire.</v>

946
00:44:57.451 --> 00:44:59.210
<v Speaker 4>There's no substance there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

947
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:00.660
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

948
00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:01.494
<v Speaker 4>I think at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the black lives matter umbrella because </v>

949
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:06.054
<v Speaker 4>it's not really sounded organization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's whoever wants black lives matter </v>

950
00:45:10.951 --> 00:45:11.784
<v Speaker 4>can claim it wherever you can claim </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself to be a member of black lives </v>

951
00:45:15.211 --> 00:45:18.870
<v Speaker 4>matter and you are um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it needs,</v>

952
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:23.930
<v Speaker 4>it needs more directed leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It needs to have some stated legislative</v>

953
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:25.914
<v Speaker 4>and policy goals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise all you're doing is you're </v>

954
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 4>raising awareness for something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people already know exists.</v>

955
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:34.360
<v Speaker 2>This is the inherent problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

956
00:45:34.361 --> 00:45:37.440
<v Speaker 2>that they feel the system has failed </v>
<v Speaker 2>them either,</v>

957
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:39.820
<v Speaker 2>either true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're there.</v>

958
00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Their goal is</v>

959
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:43.150
<v Speaker 4>to</v>

960
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.983
<v Speaker 2>make waves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily like they're trying to </v>

961
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.090
<v Speaker 2>change the system in a way that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system doesn't want to change.</v>

962
00:45:50.091 --> 00:45:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Like that's where this thing's at </v>
<v Speaker 2>loggerheads,</v>

963
00:45:51.701 --> 00:45:51.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

964
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:52.783
<v Speaker 2>But like if a guy came out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this legislation that's going to </v>

965
00:45:54.521 --> 00:45:56.020
<v Speaker 2>do this and this and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like,</v>

966
00:45:56.021 --> 00:45:57.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the protesters wouldn't,</v>

967
00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:58.060
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be down with that.</v>

968
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:03.110
<v Speaker 4>That's possible because again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the blank slate theory.</v>

969
00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.500
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

970
00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:10.900
<v Speaker 4>I project all my hopes onto x,</v>
<v Speaker 4>x candidate x political movement.</v>

971
00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.770
<v Speaker 4>It's much harder to go to then take the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next step to y and Z and saying,</v>

972
00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:16.270
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here are some legislative,</v>

973
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.213
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>differences we can make and it's not </v>

974
00:46:20.781 --> 00:46:24.770
<v Speaker 4>going to be perfect because it never is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we can move.</v>

975
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.010
<v Speaker 4>We can move ourselves forward in fits </v>
<v Speaker 4>and starts.</v>

976
00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we need.</v>

977
00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.393
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't it be fun to talk about some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff with some level of comedy </v>

978
00:46:32.891 --> 00:46:33.880
<v Speaker 2>involved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I get ya.</v>

979
00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:34.803
<v Speaker 2>I get ya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I warned you in an email and I prepare </v>

980
00:46:37.251 --> 00:46:39.370
<v Speaker 2>for me not to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be funny.</v>

981
00:46:39.371 --> 00:46:41.950
<v Speaker 2>And I said I wanted one applause break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even have a studio audience.</v>

982
00:46:41.951 --> 00:46:43.350
<v Speaker 2>What I was hoping for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

983
00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:44.960
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minor applause.</v>

984
00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:45.813
<v Speaker 2>Break there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to talk about this </v>

985
00:46:46.811 --> 00:46:47.540
<v Speaker 2>stuff with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny Way,</v>

986
00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just,</v>

987
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:49.740
<v Speaker 4>I find it interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm just,</v>

988
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm just some dude who reads the </v>
<v Speaker 4>newspaper and it's just interested in it</v>

989
00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:54.684
<v Speaker 4>and doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't pretend to know how to make it </v>

990
00:46:56.611 --> 00:46:57.444
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>

991
00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.553
<v Speaker 2>Are there any comics right now that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really think you're hitting this out of </v>

992
00:47:00.241 --> 00:47:00.340
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

993
00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.173
<v Speaker 4>park?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just sort of the general political </v>

994
00:47:03.101 --> 00:47:03.790
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

995
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:06.550
<v Speaker 4>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who came from the daily show,</v>

996
00:47:06.551 --> 00:47:07.390
<v Speaker 4>I think our</v>

997
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.530
<v Speaker 2>still doing the best work in that arena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need John Back.</v>

998
00:47:12.531 --> 00:47:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had some issues with them,</v>

999
00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:16.910
<v Speaker 2>but I think we need him back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the best.</v>

1000
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he is coming back right?</v>

1001
00:47:18.411 --> 00:47:21.110
<v Speaker 2>He's got some HBO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to do like little snippets on</v>

1002
00:47:21.111 --> 00:47:21.944
<v Speaker 2>hbo or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean sort of that nightly long </v>

1003
00:47:23.771 --> 00:47:25.310
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be great.</v>

1004
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:26.390
<v Speaker 2>It really wouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:47:26.391 --> 00:47:27.224
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's shift to movies and comedy and TV </v>

1006
00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:30.080
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1007
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:30.913
<v Speaker 2>but we can probably circle it back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some horrific societal stuff and end of </v>

1008
00:47:34.201 --> 00:47:36.460
<v Speaker 2>civilization stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in case society ends,</v>

1009
00:47:36.461 --> 00:47:37.294
<v Speaker 2>I want you to at least be able to share </v>
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts on some of the movies </v>

1010
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:41.530
<v Speaker 2>you've made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the others about Wonky Shit.</v>

1011
00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.210
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we'll let you know what,</v>

1012
00:47:43.211 --> 00:47:45.880
<v Speaker 2>five minutes of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to go for 12 to 15.</v>

1013
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.310
<v Speaker 2>We'll do five minutes away and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll finish back with all this stuff.</v>

1014
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:49.443
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so first off I was telling you right </v>

1015
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:51.880
<v Speaker 2>before we sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1016
00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:53.410
<v Speaker 2>that you were in wet hot American </v>
<v Speaker 2>summer,</v>

1017
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:55.690
<v Speaker 2>which I hadn't seen until about a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1018
00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Even though I went to one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>camps.</v>

1019
00:47:57.581 --> 00:48:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I went to Camp Shannon wind up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania and I thought it was one of</v>

1020
00:48:01.391 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 2>the most absolutely hilarious we've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

1021
00:48:03.731 --> 00:48:04.564
<v Speaker 2>I watched the series on Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which now you're just telling me you're </v>

1022
00:48:06.081 --> 00:48:07.630
<v Speaker 2>writing for season two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1023
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Which is pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you didn't write for.</v>

1024
00:48:09.131 --> 00:48:10.990
<v Speaker 2>She just not right for season one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not write the movie.</v>

1025
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that hard for you and in a movie like</v>

1026
00:48:12.821 --> 00:48:13.654
<v Speaker 2>that where there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so many of your friends obviously </v>

1027
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:19.090
<v Speaker 2>writing and you didn't get to write but </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to just act it.</v>

1028
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Is that harder than if you're writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it and acting on it?</v>

1029
00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1030
00:48:23.331 --> 00:48:24.164
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

1031
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:28.720
<v Speaker 5>I've been friends with all of those guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially my entire adult life.</v>

1032
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:29.763
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1033
00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.020
<v Speaker 5>it says if I wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1034
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:33.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1035
00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:37.280
<v Speaker 5>we share a sensibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's just,</v>

1036
00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:42.440
<v Speaker 5>it was just fun and it's not like they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were so precious with the words that you</v>

1037
00:48:42.441 --> 00:48:44.430
<v Speaker 5>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they let you kind of do your thing.</v>

1038
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:47.210
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine you guys are having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>great time because it's great.</v>

1039
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:48.410
<v Speaker 5>It's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1040
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:49.603
<v Speaker 5>And now now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm nervous writing for it </v>

1041
00:48:52.791 --> 00:48:56.210
<v Speaker 5>because I feel like I have something to </v>
<v Speaker 5>live up to write as a writer,</v>

1042
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.880
<v Speaker 5>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have to showing up on set.</v>

1043
00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.013
<v Speaker 5>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1044
00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm conscious of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of not fucking up something that I think</v>

1045
00:49:03.981 --> 00:49:05.270
<v Speaker 5>is really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

1046
00:49:05.271 --> 00:49:07.040
<v Speaker 5>so we're going to pack all the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff in real quick.</v>

1047
00:49:07.041 --> 00:49:08.840
<v Speaker 5>So you're working on like 87 other </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

1048
00:49:08.841 --> 00:49:11.480
<v Speaker 5>You're on Gaffigan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing something that I just saw a</v>

1049
00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:12.650
<v Speaker 5>billboard when other period.</v>

1050
00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1051
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

1052
00:49:14.131 --> 00:49:15.780
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like a,</v>

1053
00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like a takeoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Downton Abbey.</v>

1054
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Is that</v>

1055
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:19.490
<v Speaker 5>abby?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's as if,</v>

1056
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:23.000
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they pitched it to me as the Kardashians</v>

1057
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:25.280
<v Speaker 5>meets Downton Abbey and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially what it is.</v>

1058
00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:27.290
<v Speaker 5>And it's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:27.851
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>

1060
00:49:27.851 --> 00:49:29.390
<v Speaker 5>I knew what channel is it on comedy </v>
<v Speaker 5>central?</v>

1061
00:49:29.391 --> 00:49:31.040
<v Speaker 5>I actually know that I should've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should've known that.</v>

1062
00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.590
<v Speaker 5>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have ruined the whole interview.</v>

1063
00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:35.840
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not here to plug shit.</v>

1064
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:37.490
<v Speaker 5>You're not plugging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm here not plugging.</v>

1065
00:49:37.491 --> 00:49:39.050
<v Speaker 5>You said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well let's talk about the real stuff.</v>

1066
00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.180
<v Speaker 5>That's all I want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1067
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.470
<v Speaker 5>Let's circle back to the real stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1068
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.770
<v Speaker 5>so I mean I've got other shows out to it</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't matter.</v>

1069
00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:47.270
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm on a lot of shows.</v>

1070
00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.670
<v Speaker 5>What's your favorite thing that you had </v>
<v Speaker 5>up?</v>

1071
00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.430
<v Speaker 5>All the things you don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I always associate you with the.</v>

1072
00:49:51.431 --> 00:49:52.264
<v Speaker 5>I love the bad stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which probably does that cause you to </v>

1073
00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.510
<v Speaker 5>roll your eyes Kinda like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were like,</v>

1074
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:59.990
<v Speaker 5>it was almost as if they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that whole genre of stuff,</v>

1075
00:49:59.991 --> 00:50:00.850
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1076
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:02.820
<v Speaker 2>they did a zillion shows after that best</v>
<v Speaker 2>week ever.</v>

1077
00:50:02.821 --> 00:50:04.050
<v Speaker 2>And I in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the nineties,</v>

1078
00:50:04.051 --> 00:50:05.760
<v Speaker 2>I love the twenties or whatever else </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've.</v>

1079
00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.740
<v Speaker 2>And now every channel has those shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1080
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.660
<v Speaker 2>But you were sort of the one that like.</v>

1081
00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:10.813
<v Speaker 5>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you kind of feel like you figured </v>

1082
00:50:12.981 --> 00:50:15.020
<v Speaker 5>out what that thing was?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

1083
00:50:15.021 --> 00:50:16.890
<v Speaker 5>that commentary thing was?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1084
00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.270
<v Speaker 5>I think in a way that some of the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who maybe didn't get well when,</v>

1085
00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:24.590
<v Speaker 5>when it first started it was much more </v>
<v Speaker 5>sincere.</v>

1086
00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.750
<v Speaker 5>It was much more like Soleil Frye going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1087
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 5>do you remember Wacky Wall crawlers </v>
<v Speaker 5>crawlers.</v>

1088
00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:36.670
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was never my approach to it.</v>

1089
00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:39.950
<v Speaker 5>My approach was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just make jokes.</v>

1090
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:40.820
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1091
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:41.653
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel totally comfortable shitting on </v>

1092
00:50:43.101 --> 00:50:45.290
<v Speaker 5>your childhood right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1093
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 5>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1094
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:50.270
<v Speaker 5>they eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tone of it shifted more towards that</v>

1095
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the,</v>

1096
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.090
<v Speaker 5>can you remember Wacky Wall crawlers?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell him?</v>

1097
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Speaking of the eighties,</v>

1098
00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:58.450
<v Speaker 5>the Sega Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do anything for you because nothing.</v>

1099
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:59.990
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was after my time.</v>

1100
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.740
<v Speaker 5>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So your eight bit Nintendo or colleague?</v>

1101
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:06.920
<v Speaker 5>A Vision or a vision?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A intellivision Atari Twenty 600.</v>

1102
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.990
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So even eight bit Nintendo.</v>

1103
00:51:08.991 --> 00:51:12.620
<v Speaker 5>We only have five years apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It technology changes,</v>

1104
00:51:12.621 --> 00:51:14.750
<v Speaker 5>man moves very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:15.770
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

1106
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:20.240
<v Speaker 5>I had graduated from video games and by </v>
<v Speaker 5>the time the Sega Genesis came out.</v>

1107
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:23.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I remember once I auditioned for,</v>

1108
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:28.130
<v Speaker 5>I shot a best week ever once and one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the jokes I did,</v>

1109
00:51:28.131 --> 00:51:29.790
<v Speaker 5>it was right when current TV came out </v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

1110
00:51:29.791 --> 00:51:30.624
<v Speaker 5>which was Al Gore's television and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>joke was something to this effect that </v>

1111
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:34.011
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1112
00:51:34.011 --> 00:51:34.844
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Al Gore has a new TV channel called </v>

1113
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:38.024
<v Speaker 5>current TV.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine if George W dot Bush </v>

1114
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:40.281
<v Speaker 5>did?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1115
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:41.700
<v Speaker 5>Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

1116
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.630
<v Speaker 5>not the most brilliant thing ever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I thought I thought pretty solid.</v>

1117
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:45.620
<v Speaker 5>That's a solid joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1118
00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.140
<v Speaker 5>And I remember the producer kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>looked at me from the side,</v>

1119
00:51:48.141 --> 00:51:50.600
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to be doing that sort of</v>

1120
00:51:50.601 --> 00:51:51.470
<v Speaker 5>thing around here.</v>

1121
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.210
<v Speaker 5>And I didn't think they aired it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1122
00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.143
<v Speaker 5>my little too political for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was too political for that were </v>

1123
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:58.820
<v Speaker 5>pretty mild,</v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely mild.</v>

1124
00:51:58.821 --> 00:51:59.654
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we live in corporate culture where </v>

1125
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:05.690
<v Speaker 5>everyone's afraid to offend everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you deal with that stuff?</v>

1126
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:07.700
<v Speaker 5>So now we can circle back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when,</v>

1127
00:52:07.701 --> 00:52:09.920
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how you ever have you ever said,</v>

1128
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you know you've gotten into </v>
<v Speaker 5>some heat,</v>

1129
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:12.483
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'd said Shit on twitter that gets </v>

1130
00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:16.540
<v Speaker 5>people upset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1131
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:19.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not just talking about the Nazis.</v>

1132
00:52:19.401 --> 00:52:21.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean like a wider,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wider.</v>

1133
00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:23.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

1134
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:26.030
<v Speaker 5>it never really like widespread </v>
<v Speaker 5>condemnation.</v>

1135
00:52:26.031 --> 00:52:26.864
<v Speaker 5>It's always coming from the Michelle </v>
<v Speaker 5>Malkin crowd who never called me whiter </v>

1136
00:52:32.631 --> 00:52:34.550
<v Speaker 5>than toilet paper once or something like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1137
00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:37.880
<v Speaker 5>She said this guy is whiter than old </v>
<v Speaker 5>toilet paper.</v>

1138
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.250
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not according to the alt right.</v>

1139
00:52:40.251 --> 00:52:42.810
<v Speaker 5>You're not even like my friend.</v>

1140
00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.790
<v Speaker 5>I know big Ju.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:45.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not even like,</v>

1142
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:49.730
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1143
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:55.100
<v Speaker 5>I am not particularly self censorious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that the word?</v>

1144
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:56.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But do you think about it ever?</v>

1145
00:52:56.421 --> 00:52:59.060
<v Speaker 5>Because I do sometimes think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1146
00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.270
<v Speaker 5>like there'll be something that I want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to say like really,</v>

1147
00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.840
<v Speaker 5>and even just I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

1148
00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:04.683
<v Speaker 5>I gotta change this one word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not because it's really what I mean is </v>

1149
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:07.994
<v Speaker 5>any different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but because there's nothing wrong with </v>

1150
00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:12.194
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing wrong with making sure </v>

1151
00:53:14.751 --> 00:53:19.751
<v Speaker 5>that what you're trying to say is being </v>
<v Speaker 5>heard in the way you want to say it.</v>

1152
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:20.990
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1153
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:21.824
<v Speaker 5>when I've gotten in trouble on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's generally because I've been too </v>

1154
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:29.870
<v Speaker 5>hasty in terms of how I say something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not really about what I'm saying.</v>

1155
00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:31.933
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1156
00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:34.213
<v Speaker 5>I have no problem with there being </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequences for people saying stupid </v>

1157
00:53:37.401 --> 00:53:38.234
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The First Amendment allows you to say </v>

1158
00:53:41.691 --> 00:53:42.524
<v Speaker 5>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't protect you from the </v>

1159
00:53:44.151 --> 00:53:44.984
<v Speaker 5>consequences of your speech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just the government can come in so </v>

1160
00:53:48.081 --> 00:53:48.914
<v Speaker 5>you can use your speech and then other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people can use their speech to counter </v>

1161
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:52.400
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually a beautiful,</v>

1162
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:53.743
<v Speaker 5>beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I want to be a total asshole on </v>

1163
00:53:55.401 --> 00:53:57.620
<v Speaker 5>twitter and say racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Horrible Shit.</v>

1164
00:53:57.621 --> 00:53:58.454
<v Speaker 5>I can do that.</v>

1165
00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1166
00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:01.083
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1167
00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:02.163
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my employer might get upset with me and </v>

1168
00:54:03.251 --> 00:54:04.960
<v Speaker 5>I have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to understand that going in.</v>

1169
00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:06.183
<v Speaker 5>So there's free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but consequences of course there's </v>

1170
00:54:08.501 --> 00:54:11.370
<v Speaker 5>always been consequences to free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1171
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.200
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the idea,</v>

1172
00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:17.350
<v Speaker 5>the concept of free speech is widely </v>
<v Speaker 5>misunderstood in this country.</v>

1173
00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:19.720
<v Speaker 5>People think they should be able to sort</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1174
00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1175
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:26.230
<v Speaker 5>excrete whatever diarrhea they want from</v>
<v Speaker 5>their mouth and they absolutely can.</v>

1176
00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:27.723
<v Speaker 5>But if somebody comes along and is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to wash your mouth out with </v>

1177
00:54:29.891 --> 00:54:32.590
<v Speaker 5>soap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got to be prepared to deal with.</v>

1178
00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1179
00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Not Punch you all on what washing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth out,</v>

1180
00:54:35.301 --> 00:54:37.550
<v Speaker 2>but they can use their speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to throw you in jail.</v>

1181
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:38.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1182
00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:40.250
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I went to Ucla,</v>

1183
00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:43.070
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned before with Milo and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just did one of these,</v>

1184
00:54:43.071 --> 00:54:43.904
<v Speaker 2>which we've done many times before and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there were all these protestors and </v>

1185
00:54:46.281 --> 00:54:47.960
<v Speaker 2>first they were blocking people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in,</v>

1186
00:54:47.961 --> 00:54:50.780
<v Speaker 2>which you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you can protest of course,</v>

1187
00:54:50.781 --> 00:54:54.230
<v Speaker 2>but use your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a counter rally the next day,</v>

1188
00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:57.170
<v Speaker 2>scream all you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't throw garbage cans.</v>

1189
00:54:57.171 --> 00:54:58.790
<v Speaker 2>And they were getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting in cops faces.</v>

1190
00:54:58.791 --> 00:55:00.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean really there were people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>phones,</v>

1191
00:55:00.471 --> 00:55:03.200
<v Speaker 2>right in touch with just begging to set </v>
<v Speaker 2>them off,</v>

1192
00:55:03.201 --> 00:55:04.730
<v Speaker 2>which goes to the whole other thing we </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed.</v>

1193
00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.660
<v Speaker 2>But at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1194
00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.170
<v Speaker 2>one of the protestors came in and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1195
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.720
<v Speaker 2>we started screaming in the middle of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I stopped and I said,</v>

1196
00:55:11.721 --> 00:55:12.554
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you that if you ask Milo a </v>

1197
00:55:14.361 --> 00:55:16.100
<v Speaker 2>question right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a direct question.</v>

1198
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:17.420
<v Speaker 2>So we were going to do this at the q and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1199
00:55:17.421 --> 00:55:19.730
<v Speaker 2>but if you ask him something right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll answer it.</v>

1200
00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.040
<v Speaker 2>And she just screamed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1201
00:55:22.041 --> 00:55:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1202
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.600
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem here,</v>

1203
00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.850
<v Speaker 2>that that's my problem with what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening on the left.</v>

1204
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.863
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I opened the door for you to make a </v>

1205
00:55:31.791 --> 00:55:34.100
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make let's have that exchange of ideas.</v>

1206
00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.280
<v Speaker 2>But all she could come up with was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

1207
00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.930
<v Speaker 2>that was your chance to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1208
00:55:38.931 --> 00:55:42.350
<v Speaker 2>you are a whatever you want to call him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1209
00:55:42.351 --> 00:55:43.730
<v Speaker 2>You're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't like Muslim people,</v>

1210
00:55:43.731 --> 00:55:45.130
<v Speaker 2>you don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whenever you want to do like,</v>

1211
00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.430
<v Speaker 2>this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving you a chance.</v>

1212
00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:47.293
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of cameras here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're in front of 500 people and </v>

1213
00:55:49.281 --> 00:55:50.114
<v Speaker 2>that's what you came up with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's my problem with a lot of </v>

1214
00:55:51.591 --> 00:55:52.940
<v Speaker 2>what's going on on the colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1215
00:55:52.941 --> 00:55:54.920
<v Speaker 2>these people don't even know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're protesting.</v>

1216
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:56.003
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just hear something that they kind </v>

1217
00:55:56.841 --> 00:55:57.674
<v Speaker 2>of don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they freak out and they want </v>

1218
00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:01.390
<v Speaker 2>safe spaces and trigger warnings and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this other.</v>

1219
00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.710
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am,</v>

1220
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:05.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1221
00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:09.730
<v Speaker 5>as somebody who traffics in free speech </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a living,</v>

1222
00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:16.810
<v Speaker 5>I am cognizant of the concern on </v>
<v Speaker 5>campuses that,</v>

1223
00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.850
<v Speaker 5>that free speech is being shut down.</v>

1224
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 4>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

1225
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:29.080
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I oppose that.</v>

1226
00:56:29.081 --> 00:56:29.914
<v Speaker 4>I oppose inviting somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the campus and then because some group </v>

1227
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:35.400
<v Speaker 4>has an issue with that person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just inviting them.</v>

1228
00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:36.620
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1229
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:37.483
<v Speaker 4>a college campus of all places should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>a place where every point of view is </v>

1230
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 4>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1231
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 4>no problem with protesting those people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as you said,</v>

1232
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:52.270
<v Speaker 4>protest in a respectful way or protest </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way that is lawful,</v>

1233
00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:54.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to do it respectfully.</v>

1234
00:56:54.131 --> 00:56:58.110
<v Speaker 4>You can be loud and upset and angry and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1235
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.350
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1236
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:01.561
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

1237
00:57:01.561 --> 00:57:03.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can block the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1238
00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:05.760
<v Speaker 4>well you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to get arrested.</v>

1239
00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:06.870
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's on you.</v>

1240
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.600
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1241
00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:14.140
<v Speaker 4>but I do think the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1242
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:14.920
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1243
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 4>the college campus thing has gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from what I read,</v>

1244
00:57:17.441 --> 00:57:18.274
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know because I'm not </v>

1245
00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:19.323
<v Speaker 4>experiencing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it feels like it's gotten very </v>

1246
00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:21.880
<v Speaker 4>intolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1247
00:57:21.881 --> 00:57:23.710
<v Speaker 4>and that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a real problem.</v>

1248
00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.570
<v Speaker 5>And the danger is that these are our </v>
<v Speaker 5>future leaders.</v>

1249
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:28.850
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm contributing is I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>think it's a problem.</v>

1250
00:57:28.851 --> 00:57:31.760
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a problem in the sense that</v>

1251
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:37.523
<v Speaker 5>I think it speaks to a larger problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do think people will leave those </v>

1252
00:57:40.501 --> 00:57:45.060
<v Speaker 5>institutions and take their place in </v>
<v Speaker 5>society and it will all be fine.</v>

1253
00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:45.894
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not concerned about it longterm </v>

1254
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:50.340
<v Speaker 5>particularly really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you don't think like that.</v>

1255
00:57:50.341 --> 00:57:51.174
<v Speaker 5>Just a generation of these people who </v>
<v Speaker 5>had been sort of coddled into the safe </v>

1256
00:57:53.851 --> 00:57:58.170
<v Speaker 5>space thing that they're going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 year olds that are 25 years.</v>

1257
00:57:59.010 --> 00:57:59.843
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That eventually they'll have been so </v>

1258
00:58:00.631 --> 00:58:03.640
<v Speaker 5>used to never hearing anything that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't like or,</v>

1259
00:58:03.641 --> 00:58:04.474
<v Speaker 5>or everything that they don't like is </v>
<v Speaker 5>hate speech in their eyes that they've </v>

1260
00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:10.650
<v Speaker 5>diminished the ability to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That that's my concern.</v>

1261
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:11.993
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a little</v>

1262
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:14.680
<v Speaker 4>what concern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen no evidence to this point that</v>

1263
00:58:14.681 --> 00:58:16.900
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be a problem down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>

1264
00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it will be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it won't be.</v>

1265
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:18.874
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1266
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:22.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that concerned about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only because I feel like my,</v>

1267
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:26.230
<v Speaker 4>my basic philosophy in parenting and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>life is the kids are all right.</v>

1268
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:27.480
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be fine.</v>

1269
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:29.740
<v Speaker 5>Did you steal that from movie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did not.</v>

1270
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.590
<v Speaker 5>You were thinking that before?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1271
00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.060
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the kids are all right.</v>

1272
00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.550
<v Speaker 5>There'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll all work itself out.</v>

1273
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:37.683
<v Speaker 5>I do think the larger point is this idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>that victimization is empowerment that </v>

1274
00:58:45.341 --> 00:58:46.174
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by claiming victim status are there by </v>

1275
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:49.623
<v Speaker 5>empowered and thereby take the moral </v>
<v Speaker 5>high ground in whatever you do by the </v>

1276
00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.180
<v Speaker 5>victim status.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's problematic to me.</v>

1277
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:56.970
<v Speaker 5>So what do we do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because that,</v>

1278
00:58:56.971 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 5>that gets to the heart of all of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1279
00:58:58.991 --> 00:59:02.380
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's trying to figure out how they</v>
<v Speaker 5>are a victim so that they can somehow be</v>

1280
00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:03.214
<v Speaker 5>a little more moral problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone beneath him is with very few </v>

1281
00:59:10.231 --> 00:59:13.200
<v Speaker 5>exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people can make a claim,</v>

1282
00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:14.131
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

1283
00:59:14.131 --> 00:59:14.701
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

1284
00:59:14.701 --> 00:59:17.550
<v Speaker 5>their claims are not without merit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1285
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:20.370
<v Speaker 5>whether you're black,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hispanic,</v>

1286
00:59:20.371 --> 00:59:22.580
<v Speaker 5>Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>female,</v>

1287
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:24.470
<v Speaker 4>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is you are,</v>

1288
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:25.963
<v Speaker 4>you can make an argument like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have faced some problems and you </v>

1289
00:59:29.961 --> 00:59:31.760
<v Speaker 4>have to deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1290
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:33.553
<v Speaker 4>and there's nothing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in asserting and stating your </v>

1291
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:37.094
<v Speaker 4>case and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is where I feel like society is </v>

1292
00:59:38.871 --> 00:59:40.520
<v Speaker 4>coming up short and dealing with us.</v>

1293
00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:43.143
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

1294
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you're saying,</v>

1295
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:48.524
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no positive movement beyond </v>

1296
00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:53.690
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you've identified your grievances,</v>

1297
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:54.950
<v Speaker 4>you can't wallow in them</v>

1298
00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:56.910
<v Speaker 2>because the world isn't going to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>you anything,</v>

1299
00:59:56.911 --> 00:59:58.590
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think the world should give </v>
<v Speaker 2>you anything.</v>

1300
00:59:58.591 --> 00:59:59.424
<v Speaker 2>We should all be treated equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The playing field has to be equal and </v>

1301
01:00:01.441 --> 01:00:02.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe the playing field isn't equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1302
01:00:02.941 --> 01:00:03.774
<v Speaker 2>that's I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the larger issue that the playing field </v>

1303
01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.240
<v Speaker 2>isn't equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

1304
01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:08.043
<v Speaker 4>what's so funny about trump is he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>elevated the white male to victim </v>

1305
01:00:12.431 --> 01:00:13.510
<v Speaker 4>status.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1306
01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:14.373
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he somehow made white men into victims </v>

1307
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:17.463
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

1308
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the final frontier of hilarity.</v>

1309
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.380
<v Speaker 2>It's funny to me too because if I make </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun of Hilary,</v>

1310
01:00:24.381 --> 01:00:25.214
<v Speaker 2>which I do all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love it and it gets a zillion </v>

1311
01:00:26.731 --> 01:00:28.850
<v Speaker 2>retweets and if I make fun of Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they love it,</v>

1312
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:29.833
<v Speaker 2>but I make fun of anyone and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>time they were telling me how much they </v>

1313
01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:32.340
<v Speaker 2>love free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1314
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:33.493
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say this as I understand that free </v>

1315
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.620
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lma you should on there,</v>

1316
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:37.993
<v Speaker 2>but then every time I make a trump on </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullet but joke and now you're saying </v>

1317
01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:42.104
<v Speaker 2>you don't get it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they can use their free speech </v>

1318
01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:46.340
<v Speaker 2>to counter me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I always think it's like,</v>

1319
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.440
<v Speaker 2>I just want them to understand like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of the irony here.</v>

1320
01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.600
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like guys,</v>

1321
01:00:50.601 --> 01:00:52.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like,</v>

1322
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.590
<v Speaker 2>kill the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1323
01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.120
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1324
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:55.830
<v Speaker 2>it's hard</v>

1325
01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:57.270
<v Speaker 4>when your guys being attacked and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1326
01:00:57.271 --> 01:00:58.200
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

1327
01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.330
<v Speaker 4>in an election season,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1328
01:01:00.331 --> 01:01:03.450
<v Speaker 4>even as somebody who's not like an and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hillary supporter,</v>

1329
01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:04.650
<v Speaker 4>when I hear her getting attacked,</v>

1330
01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.200
<v Speaker 2>my hackles go up and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have to check myself.</v>

1331
01:01:08.201 --> 01:01:08.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1332
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Why do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's funny because I've had,</v>

1333
01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:13.123
<v Speaker 2>I don't really like Hillary and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like trump and I don't know what I may </v>

1334
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.010
<v Speaker 2>vote for Gary Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still in that short.</v>

1335
01:01:18.011 --> 01:01:19.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll say something a couple weeks I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>

1336
01:01:19.571 --> 01:01:23.530
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've defended Hillary at times because I</v>

1337
01:01:23.531 --> 01:01:27.070
<v Speaker 2>think the attacks from a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie people were totally unfair,</v>

1338
01:01:27.071 --> 01:01:30.580
<v Speaker 2>like making it sound like she's truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>this warm on monitoring neo-con.</v>

1339
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:33.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like she's not calling for war </v>
<v Speaker 2>against anyone.</v>

1340
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.050
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know she's made some bad choices,</v>

1341
01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.500
<v Speaker 2>but Obama was the president for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those bad choices too,</v>

1342
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.360
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1343
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Olivia and whatever else and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the serious stuff.</v>

1344
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.330
<v Speaker 2>But it's like every time I'd defend her </v>
<v Speaker 2>then people say,</v>

1345
01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a hillary supporter.</v>

1346
01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:46.850
<v Speaker 2>And then I make a joke about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't it.</v>

1347
01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:47.733
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1348
01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.633
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of noise at the end of the </v>

1349
01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.420
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1350
01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:53.020
<v Speaker 2>that's the world you're trafficking in </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1351
01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:55.890
<v Speaker 2>The noise world and noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the Iot world?</v>

1352
01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to my house in Connecticut.</v>

1353
01:01:58.530 --> 01:01:59.550
<v Speaker 2>You are from Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1354
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:00.700

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1355
01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is though,</v>

1356
01:02:02.321 --> 01:02:03.154
<v Speaker 2>that you're a heterosexual white man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like being around that </v>

1357
01:02:07.631 --> 01:02:09.610
<v Speaker 2>privilege wouldn't be that great for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For you.</v>

1358
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:10.583
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1365
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.830
<v Speaker 4>diversity up in Connecticut.</v>

1366
01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you get a little bit?</v>

1367
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not in a,</v>

1368

<v Speaker 2>what's the really fat granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1370
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.141
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1371
01:02:31.141 --> 01:02:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Diversity over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>

1372
01:02:32.191 --> 01:02:33.024
<v Speaker 2>when I was doing standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do catering gigs a lot in </v>

1373
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was not a,</v>

1374
01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:36.973
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was the widest thing here </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's colors of white that I had </v>

1375
01:02:39.241 --> 01:02:40.830
<v Speaker 2>never seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how white it was.</v>

1376
01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's anything wrong with that.</v>

1377
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:43.583
<v Speaker 2>Where I am</v>

1378
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:46.550
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is pretty white and it's embarrassing.</v>

1379
01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.253
<v Speaker 4>It gets to the point where like every </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sunday there's a concerts on the green </v>

1380
01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.760
<v Speaker 4>in my little town and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1381
01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:00.380
<v Speaker 4>the few black families that live in </v>
<v Speaker 4>town,</v>

1382
01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:01.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>

1383
01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:06.080
<v Speaker 4>you just stare at them like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know most patronizing way.</v>

1384
01:03:06.081 --> 01:03:07.490
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you,</v>

1385
01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.770
<v Speaker 4>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>White guilt is something,</v>

1386
01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:10.760
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the worst.</v>

1387
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.731
<v Speaker 4>It's the worst.</v>

1389
01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.153

<v Speaker 4>there are times where I feel like I </v>

1390
01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:16.320
<v Speaker 4>could die from white guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1391
01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:21.340
<v Speaker 4>I was on a cruise ship and the waitstaff</v>
<v Speaker 4>at this dinner,</v>

1398
01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:42.100
<v Speaker 2>white guilt right now because you were </v>
