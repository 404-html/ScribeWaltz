00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Catherine verbal saying welcome to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rubin report.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you for having me.</v>

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I've heard a rumor that you sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>play my videos in your classrooms.</v>

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about the classrooms,</v>

9
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:34.430
<v Speaker 1>but among staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among staff in the school,</v>

10
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in this school,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

13
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Far too controversial to play in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom.</v>

14
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

15
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:43.064
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much I want to talk to you </v>

16
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about education,</v>

17
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your personal,</v>

18
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>sort of political evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things that you've been through.</v>

19
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:51.374
<v Speaker 1>So I always like finding out a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about somebody's history at the top </v>

20
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>and you come from a long line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers and some interesting background</v>

21
00:00:59.031 --> 00:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

22
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>So tell me a little bit about Catherine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming and my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father is Indian guy.</v>

24
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine mom is and Black Jamaican.</v>

25
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I say that because the whole race thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is important,</v>

26
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bizarrely because these days,</v>

27
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:14.684
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are so much more interested in </v>

28
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:19.510
<v Speaker 1>who said it as opposed to what is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>said and uh,</v>

29
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat some random person set up a </v>

30
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:22.484
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia page for me and there was this</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of major argument going on between </v>

31
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>my detractors and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people who support me.</v>

32
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>People that support me wanted the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be there.</v>

33
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 1>The people who didn't like me wanted it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

34
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.273
<v Speaker 1>wanted me to be Indian rather than black</v>
<v Speaker 1>because black was kind of a bigger </v>

35
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to discredit me,</v>

36
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>they needed me to push me up the victim </v>
<v Speaker 1>pole,</v>

37
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:42.854
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my head hard following the </v>

38
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:45.464
<v Speaker 1>oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics,</v>

39
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>the whole operation of it.</v>

40
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

41
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

42
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother was a nurse,</v>

44
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>my father taught at university and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and came from,</v>

45
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirt poverty in Ghana,</v>

46
00:01:57.891 --> 00:01:58.724
<v Speaker 1>but is one of those extraordinary people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who made something of himself through </v>

47
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:02.020
<v Speaker 1>hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

48
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I was born in New Zealand and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up in Canada and then I've now been</v>

49
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:06.854
<v Speaker 1>in London for nearly 30 years and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Oxford University and I've </v>

50
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>been a teacher ever since and I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very left wing teacher,</v>

51
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.543
<v Speaker 1>a very typical teacher in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I used to write a blog which was </v>

52
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:22.214
<v Speaker 1>called to ms dot would love based on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book and films to Sir with Love Sidney </v>

53
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Poitier was in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

54
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.203
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this blog a few times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go home and write about how little </v>

55
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>johnny had his money stolen and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>

56
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Things that made me really upset about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the education system.</v>

57
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.323
<v Speaker 1>And let's pause for a second before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to get to the point where you sort </v>

58
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:42.104
<v Speaker 1>of woke up and got in trouble and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have people fighting on your </v>

59
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:45.530
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

60
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:46.364
<v Speaker 1>what sort of education did you have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed you towards leftism or was it </v>

61
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:51.014
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how it was Kinda like where did </v>

62
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 1>those ideas come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that,</v>

63
00:02:55.761 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 1>did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that come from family?</v>

64
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Was it meeting my family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

65
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting because I think,</v>

66
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:03.874
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic minorities really are small c </v>

67
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>conservative naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because,</v>

68
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black vote normally goes to the </v>

69
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>my family was no different from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical fam,</v>

71
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic family in that sense.</v>

72
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>And so I was brought up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

73
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>in a left wing household.</v>

74
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.063
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they generally vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>small c conservative or why do they </v>

75
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.770
<v Speaker 1>internally either think it or have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught to think?</v>

76
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I think they come from small c </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>

77
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm a background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I say that,</v>

78
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>just the belief in and pulling yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>up from your own booze,</v>

79
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.150
<v Speaker 1>but your own bootstraps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

80
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.243
<v Speaker 1>hard work will get you somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A personal responsibility being stoical </v>

81
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:44.554
<v Speaker 1>when things are difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kind of thing that makes people </v>

82
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:49.430
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

83
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think minorities,</v>

84
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones who've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>

85
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:53.824
<v Speaker 1>moved somewhere new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe in giving their children a </v>

86
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>better life and in working hard in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to do so.</v>

87
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.103
<v Speaker 1>So it fits with them now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you come from a small seed </v>

88
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>conservative family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kind of voting left.</v>

89
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's right.</v>

90
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.263
<v Speaker 1>I'm a teacher so everyone I know is on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left and I don't speak to any </v>

91
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>conservative people because that's how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

92
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>There's this big divide and nobody ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaks to each other.</v>

93
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know any conservative people or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way conservative people thought.</v>

94
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.213
<v Speaker 1>And then I was writing this blog and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I started meeting </v>

95
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>conservative people and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet on my blog.</v>

96
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:28.024
<v Speaker 1>So twitter didn't exist in those days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would have discussions on the </v>

97
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:35.371
<v Speaker 1>blog comment section and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these left wingers would come on and</v>

98
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:36.874
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start attacking me and telling me how </v>

99
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:38.764
<v Speaker 1>awful I was with the stories that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing and how can I judge the </v>

100
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 1>education system as I was judging it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

101
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.530
<v Speaker 1>all these conservatives would come on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and defend me and I'd be saying,</v>

102
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.311
<v Speaker 1>the left wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

103
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

104
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.393
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

106
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd say,</v>

107
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a right winger.</v>

108
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:53.591
<v Speaker 1>And I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

109
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>of course I'm not on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I'm not conservative,</v>

110
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm a good person.</v>

111
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.463
<v Speaker 1>So how could I possibly be conservative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Conservatives would come on and </v>

112
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll find that you are.</v>

113
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.360
<v Speaker 1>And over years of me writing and me </v>
<v Speaker 1>insisting that I was on the left,</v>

114
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I came to realize that I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that my instincts,</v>

115
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 1>the things that I valued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the values,</v>

116
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:18.030
<v Speaker 1>it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

117
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 1>those basic values of personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and,</v>

118
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:21.561
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

119
00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perseverance and,</v>

120
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being happy with competition and all</v>

121
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

122
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked and then I realized like,</v>

123
00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I came to realize slowly and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I met a few people.</v>

124
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.433
<v Speaker 1>So like I met you would be interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're always interested in </v>

125
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 1>meeting people who don't think like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met this guy.</v>

126
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:40.954
<v Speaker 1>So there was this guy used to come onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>my blog called a British national party </v>

127
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was,</v>

128
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.003
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

129
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people call it the fascist party,</v>

130
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the day they had a lot more power</v>

131
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:54.250
<v Speaker 1>than they do nowadays.</v>

132
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.473
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was part of the BNP and I would </v>

133
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.454
<v Speaker 1>let him come on my blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all of these kinds of lefties were </v>

134
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you let them come on your blog?</v>

135
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:06.070
<v Speaker 1>You need to ban him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I always thought just commenting,</v>

136
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.053
<v Speaker 1>commenting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would comment and get into </v>

137
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:08.684
<v Speaker 1>discussions sometimes in the and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes with other people and some of </v>

138
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>the left wingers would refuse to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him at all,</v>

139
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get really angry with me that I</v>

140
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>should just say you're not allowed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>on here.</v>

141
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on there for ages,</v>

142
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>this is over years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

143
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I said,</v>

144
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:25.454
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be really interesting to meet you </v>

145
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>because you're very different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody I know.</v>

146
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And so I met this guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

147
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>he was a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:35.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

149
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that he believed about,</v>

150
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:38.020
<v Speaker 1>black people and so on.</v>

151
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 1>He was a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

152
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>what I always say is some of my best </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends are racist,</v>

00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>everyone's a little bit racist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are racist on different levels.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

159

<v Speaker 1>Is Young white guy wearing a suit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice shoes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and he went and he took me for lunch.</v>

162
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>He paid for lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the racist took you for lunch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

164
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what so interesting about life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

165
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we went for lunch and he was hobbling</v>

166
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:13.150
<v Speaker 1>along and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 1>you were right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

168
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:15.314
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.453
<v Speaker 1>the thing is I bought this suit and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these shoes because I was meeting </v>

170
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:20.054
<v Speaker 1>with you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went to Oxford University and I </v>

171
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:25.360
<v Speaker 1>figured I've got to get dressed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:26.503
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoes are new and they're really </v>

173
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>hurting my feet.</v>

174
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that interesting?</v>

175
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Here's this racist who was taking me for</v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch,</v>

176
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 1>who's wearing new shoes that he's bought</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've been to Oxford,</v>

177
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:37.904
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's so interesting about </v>

178
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>life is that it's not as easy as some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left put people,</v>

179
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:44.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a racist,</v>

180

<v Speaker 1>you're not a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a good person,</v>

181
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're this,</v>

182
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.503
<v Speaker 1>it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole variety of different </v>

183
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 1>ways of seeing people and learning from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

184
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.293
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he able to learn from you after </v>

185
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

186
00:07:56.331 --> 00:08:00.400
<v Speaker 1>we met a second time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

187
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>when I say he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

188
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.213
<v Speaker 1>like he was telling me about how that </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning he'd been to see his girlfriend </v>

189
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:09.270
<v Speaker 1>and they have a toddler and he'd gone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see her and see the,</v>

190
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby.</v>

191
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.503
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't let him hold the baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she knew that he was coming to </v>

192
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:14.714
<v Speaker 1>see me and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to contaminate him because </v>

193
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.173
<v Speaker 1>you're going to.</v>

194
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

195
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

196
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.553
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>he was a good guy in so many other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what,</v>

198
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.950
<v Speaker 1>that's what's interesting about life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'd say.</v>

199
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that uh,</v>

200
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>nobody's perfect and people change their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

201
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:38.834
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about my parents who lived in </v>

202
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 1>the same house for 46 years in Toronto </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

203
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.740
<v Speaker 1>there was a man called Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snow who lived opposite them and when he</v>

204
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 1>moved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they moved into the area,</v>

205
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>it was all white and he was outraged </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was a racist and he thought,</v>

206
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>no way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want these people living there.</v>

207
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.373
<v Speaker 1>And over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the 46 years they got to know each </v>

208
00:08:56.041 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>other and they became friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the end Mr Snow's wife,</v>

209
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

210
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 1>she got cancer and she died and Mr Snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

211
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I had to depend on my parents for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole lot of help and,</v>

212
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 1>and my parents loved Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snow and Mr Snell loved them.</v>

213
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>things can change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can change.</v>

215
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.370
<v Speaker 1>And when Mr Snow died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents moved house because the,</v>

216
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the community they lived in had had died</v>

217
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.000
<v Speaker 1>with Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snow.</v>

218
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.210
<v Speaker 1>And this was a man who was so racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want them to live there.</v>

219
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

220
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.110
<v Speaker 2>isn't it personally powerful too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

221
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:30.944
<v Speaker 2>I can feel it when you're saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you can accept some people for all </v>

222
00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:35.174
<v Speaker 2>their flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it actually allows you to figure </v>

223
00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:40.910
<v Speaker 2>out how to grow instead of just othering</v>
<v Speaker 2>them forever.</v>

224
00:09:40.911 --> 00:09:41.744
<v Speaker 2>Even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they might do that to a whole </v>

225
00:09:42.711 --> 00:09:44.360
<v Speaker 2>set of people for awful reasons.</v>

226
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

227
00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:48.620
<v Speaker 1>and they can change people change their </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>

228
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:49.454
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this quote in my office from </v>

229
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Ali that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

230
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a man at 40 still thinks the same way</v>

231
00:09:54.741 --> 00:09:57.110
<v Speaker 1>as when he was 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he's lost 20 years of his life,</v>

232
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.730
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

233
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.530
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thank God we can change.</v>

234
00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think about how I used to think,</v>

235
00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how I think now,</v>

236
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's what life's all about.</v>

237
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.351
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

238
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:08.184
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's back up to some of those ideas </v>

239
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you were,</v>

240
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.260
<v Speaker 2>you were a lefty and then you started </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching in inner city schools.</v>

241
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.443
<v Speaker 2>That's when you started waking up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what sort of forced you to force </v>

242
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:19.683
<v Speaker 2>you or led you to write the blog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were some of the ideas that you </v>

243
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 2>were seeing specifically that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>

244
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not working in these schools?</v>

245
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:26.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

246
00:10:26.811 --> 00:10:27.644
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the big things that I used to </v>

247
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:30.794
<v Speaker 1>think before going into teaching and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone used to just accept was that a </v>

248
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.370
<v Speaker 1>black kids failed at school because </v>
<v Speaker 1>white teachers are racist.</v>

249
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.340
<v Speaker 1>The system is racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white teachers are racist.</v>

250
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's why black kids are failing.</v>

251
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.203
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers go into teaching for racist </v>

252
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.440
<v Speaker 2>purposes than anything.</v>

253
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's so crazy.</v>

254
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've met hundreds,</v>

255
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.673
<v Speaker 1>thousands of teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one of them has ever said to me I'm </v>

256
00:10:52.391 --> 00:10:54.410
<v Speaker 1>a racist and I want to stop black kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

257
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.620
<v Speaker 1>from succeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

258
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.570
<v Speaker 1>they are killing themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

259
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.543
<v Speaker 1>working all hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving everything that they can to the </v>

260
00:11:01.811 --> 00:11:02.930
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

261
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.460
<v Speaker 1>and I started to question the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that the,</v>

262
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.040
<v Speaker 1>the normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal way of seeing things was a w,</v>

263
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.120
<v Speaker 1>what I was being told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't just that,</v>

264
00:11:13.121 --> 00:11:13.954
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which we might get into later about </v>

265
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.850
<v Speaker 1>teaching methods and about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

266
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.550
<v Speaker 1>a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on the consent,</v>

267
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.403
<v Speaker 2>we're going to send the whole second </v>
<v Speaker 2>half is going to be on your solution </v>

268
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.140
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just with the restroom,</v>

269
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.380
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

270
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

271
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to question all of that.</v>

272
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.033
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went there was this a black </v>

273
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:34.770
<v Speaker 1>achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of conference that used to happen</v>

274
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:35.604
<v Speaker 1>once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was about improving black </v>

275
00:11:37.471 --> 00:11:39.720
<v Speaker 1>achievement and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do raising black achievement.</v>

276
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:41.240
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was uh,</v>

277
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor,</v>

278
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's our left a political policy,</v>

279
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.570
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman MP.</v>

280
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.523
<v Speaker 1>So one of our politicians who used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run this thing and I went along and I </v>

281
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 1>took one of the white teachers who I </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked with and he was older than me.</v>

282
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:57.154
<v Speaker 1>He's retired now and he'd been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this for 25 years and I've given </v>

283
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:01.024
<v Speaker 1>everything to the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I took him along and these people </v>

284
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 1>were standing up on stage essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that white teachers were racist.</v>

285
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.823
<v Speaker 1>And I was so embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so humiliated that I had taken </v>

286
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:13.924
<v Speaker 1>this man giving up his Saturday to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sit and be told that he's a racist </v>

287
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.920
<v Speaker 1>when he had given everything to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>black boys.</v>

288
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.570
<v Speaker 1>So we worked in this boy's school and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was mainly black boys in this school and</v>

289
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:26.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

290
00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was mortified.</v>

291
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm so gradually I started change my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind on these sorts of things and then I</v>

292
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:37.450
<v Speaker 1>started to see that it has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>our expectations of kids.</v>

293
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.600
<v Speaker 1>It had to do with our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

294
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.703
<v Speaker 1>our expectations of parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had to do with the kinds of values </v>

295
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 1>that we were giving them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we were saying to them,</v>

296
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 1>poor you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a victim,</v>

297
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:49.180
<v Speaker 1>life is so difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're black,</v>

298
00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you'll never be able to get anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's quite hard for the black inner</v>

299
00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 1>city boy to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

300
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>actually it's about working hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

302
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 1>we always say at school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when it's difficult,</v>

303
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do what's right,</v>

304
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as opposed to saying it's difficult,</v>

305
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except before Mckayla,</v>

306
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.213
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that business of even when it's </v>

307
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's difficult,</v>

308
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that value,</v>

309
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.571
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

310
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:15.760
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that business of believing in hard work,</v>

311
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

312
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we would give kids excuses.</v>

313
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:25.410
<v Speaker 1>We give kids excuses to fail and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do it in my classroom and uh,</v>

314
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.323
<v Speaker 1>the kids behave for me and the kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned with me and of course I'm not </v>

315
00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:32.800
<v Speaker 1>the only teacher was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are teachers all over the place in</v>

316
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:34.450
<v Speaker 1>their own classrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing that.</v>

317
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I,</v>

318
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.873
<v Speaker 2>what I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did the administration think of </v>

319
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.640
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it sounds like,</v>

320
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

321
00:13:41.511 --> 00:13:43.400
<v Speaker 2>we've got you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously as you said,</v>

322
00:13:43.401 --> 00:13:45.710
<v Speaker 2>you weren't the only one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got people pushing against the</v>

323
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:46.544
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the fabric of what these </v>

324
00:13:48.501 --> 00:13:50.600
<v Speaker 2>schools eventually become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not,</v>

325
00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:51.613
<v Speaker 2>it's not on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on the system that is ruined these </v>

326
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.060
<v Speaker 2>people before they've even begun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

327
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're poor.</v>

328
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.253
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't suppose people realize what I </v>

329
00:14:00.121 --> 00:14:01.050
<v Speaker 1>was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

330
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to kids privately,</v>

331
00:14:03.001 --> 00:14:05.580
<v Speaker 1>you do your own thing and if kids are </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaving for you and you're getting good</v>

332
00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:08.310
<v Speaker 1>results and then the principal loves </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

333
00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:09.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

334
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.160
<v Speaker 1>it just works and people don't know why </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

335
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not even sure I realized why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

336
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:15.000
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

337
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.790
<v Speaker 1>you build up an experience over years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

338
00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:20.670
<v Speaker 1>what works with the kids and how you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them on board and how you show them that</v>

339
00:14:20.671 --> 00:14:21.504
<v Speaker 1>you're in charge and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you teach them properly and </v>

340
00:14:23.431 --> 00:14:24.300
<v Speaker 1>they love you for it</v>

341
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.343
<v Speaker 2>and realize that your political </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution was happening at the exact </v>

342
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 2>same time because it was sort of very </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal in the classroom.</v>

343
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:35.290
<v Speaker 2>But then that you were evolving would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been in another sense.</v>

344
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:36.963
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

345
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.850
<v Speaker 2>because I think that's how it is for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people.</v>

346
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 2>When people come up to me on the street </v>
<v Speaker 2>or email me,</v>

347
00:14:41.021 --> 00:14:41.561
<v Speaker 2>they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

348
00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:42.394
<v Speaker 2>something's happening at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dealing with this and now it's </v>

349
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:47.380
<v Speaker 2>starting to make me think differently </v>
<v Speaker 2>about politics.</v>

350
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Or I used to always vote Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

351
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 2>something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my family,</v>

352
00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 2>we got</v>

353
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.873
<v Speaker 1>into conversation and now I'm starting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think something else is a little bit </v>

354
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:56.270
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the blog.</v>

355
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.253
<v Speaker 1>So it was the conservatives on my blog </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was realizing I'm agreeing with </v>

356
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 1>you and I'm not agreeing with the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>wingers on the blog.</v>

357
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And it was then that I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

358
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:12.191
<v Speaker 1>maybe I am just a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I accepted it and then,</v>

359
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted the idea of being conservative.</v>

360
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And then in 2010 I voted conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a major deal for me.</v>

361
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was funny because,</v>

362
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I did that,</v>

363
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:27.650
<v Speaker 1>I remember this is after I ended up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the press and so on,</v>

364
00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I was speaking to a friend of mine and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said to her and she's Indian,</v>

365
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Speaker 1>and I said to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

366
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.183
<v Speaker 1>able obviously you've seen me in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>press and everything and how I voted </v>

367
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>

368
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:36.771
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

369
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:38.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have something to tell you capital.</v>

370
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.080
<v Speaker 1>I voted conservative too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing.</v>

371
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 1>People are doing this in the candidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

372
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:44.954
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I voted conservative in May 2010 and </v>

373
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:52.730
<v Speaker 1>then in October 2010 I was invited to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Conservative Party conference to,</v>

374
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.330
<v Speaker 1>to give a speech and that's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>convention.</v>

375
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.310
<v Speaker 1>You guys have conventions here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

376
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.103
<v Speaker 1>I was a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really took much notice of </v>

377
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>political things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

378
00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

379
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I was a bit naive and a bit stupid to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>

380
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.340
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

381
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I went along and I gave this speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

382
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience really liked and um,</v>

383
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.060
<v Speaker 1>and then I ended up all over the press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the speech really.</v>

384
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.690
<v Speaker 1>That changed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changed my life.</v>

385
00:16:17.691 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the worst at the time.</v>

386
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:20.804
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think now I can look back and say it </v>

387
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:25.070
<v Speaker 1>was for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the better in many ways or at least.</v>

388
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

389
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.370
<v Speaker 1>every cloud has a silver lining and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>silver lining has been,</v>

390
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 1>has been a good one because I've made it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a silver lining,</v>

391
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 1>but I could have been destroyed by it </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite easily.</v>

392
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end I ended up without a job.</v>

393
00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I was told that I would never get a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>in state education ever again.</v>

394
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Lay out some of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about in the speech.</v>

395
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.120
<v Speaker 1>So I talked about black kids failing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I talked about,</v>

396
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.493
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about that's not expecting </v>

397
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.123
<v Speaker 1>enough of kids and how we are constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>making excuses for them and how we </v>

398
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:05.870
<v Speaker 1>labeled them with things like anger </v>
<v Speaker 1>management or a,</v>

399
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dyslexia or,</v>

400
00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:08.994
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or all these kinds of labels that we </v>

401
00:17:10.361 --> 00:17:11.051
<v Speaker 1>give the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

402
00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:13.050
<v Speaker 1>he can't possibly be behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

403
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.370
<v Speaker 1>he's got issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we always say they have,</v>

404
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.673
<v Speaker 1>they have particular needs and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to meet their needs as opposed </v>

405
00:17:20.861 --> 00:17:22.270
<v Speaker 1>to just expecting them to behave.</v>

406
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has different needs.</v>

407
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't expect anything of them.</v>

408
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's just the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the norm.</v>

409
00:17:29.921 --> 00:17:32.110
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about all of this.</v>

410
00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:32.944
<v Speaker 1>I talked about competition and how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was needed in schools that kids need to </v>

411
00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:38.440
<v Speaker 1>feel as if they're competing against </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else and so on.</v>

412
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.513
<v Speaker 1>They need to feel like they're being </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired to work hard as opposed to </v>

413
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.760
<v Speaker 1>being indulged and constantly let.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Off the hook because while it's not your</v>

414
00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 1>fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents are divorced,</v>

415
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not your fault because you live on </v>
<v Speaker 1>an estate and your black and your mom is</v>

416
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:56.850
<v Speaker 1>a single mom and you can't possibly do </v>
<v Speaker 1>your homework.</v>

417
00:17:56.851 --> 00:17:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it,</v>

418
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

419
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was because over the years,</v>

420
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:01.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've visited,</v>

421
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd worked for a summer once in South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

422
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.793
<v Speaker 1>I've been to see schools in China and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil and India and all of these </v>

423
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:09.114
<v Speaker 1>countries where the kids were far poorer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet they were walking five miles </v>

424
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 1>getting to school and working really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

425
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.130
<v Speaker 1>So why was it that those kids could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

426
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.260
<v Speaker 1>And apparently our kids couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

427
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.400
<v Speaker 1>so that was why I questioned it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said all of this stuff at the conference</v>

428
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:24.234
<v Speaker 1>and the Conservatives liked what I said </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nobody ever says this sort of </v>

429
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.640
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as I say,</v>

430
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:31.900
<v Speaker 1>it was out of a job and then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I do?</v>

431
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.600
<v Speaker 1>How does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you give this speech,</v>

432
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.450
<v Speaker 1>you're fired the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I resigned in the end,</v>

433
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but it was just untenable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the press I was,</v>

434
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.193
<v Speaker 1>I was everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of those Hollywood </v>

435
00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:42.474
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't go outside my door because </v>

436
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.590
<v Speaker 1>they were oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting outside to talk to me.</v>

437
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our responsibilities of thing.</v>

438
00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Go get her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what's so crazy.</v>

439
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.970
<v Speaker 1>All I said was ultimately I was saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the education system was broken and</v>

440
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 1>people wouldn't have that.</v>

441
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is I do feel it's like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emperor's new clothes,</v>

442
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.520
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

443
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows that there's a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the education system,</v>

444
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's willing to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

445
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:08.723
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got hundreds if not thousands of </v>

446
00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:13.350
<v Speaker 1>emails from teachers all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country saying,</v>

447
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.590
<v Speaker 1>thank God someone said something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for saying something.</v>

448
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:17.543
<v Speaker 1>I won't tell you my name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you my name because I'll </v>

449
00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:22.020
<v Speaker 1>lose my job because they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified.</v>

450
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

451
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.530
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

452
00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:26.364
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I then thought about the private sector </v>

453
00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>for a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I thought,</v>

454
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I love working with disadvantaged kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love working in the inner city.</v>

455
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.040
<v Speaker 1>This is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I know,</v>

456
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 1>a knock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving up,</v>

457
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.570
<v Speaker 1>so we had just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had charter schools,</v>

458
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America for a long time.</v>

459
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.530
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was only in 2010.</v>

460
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Speaker 1>The free schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are charter schools started in,</v>

461
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the possibility of setting one</v>

462
00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:51.710
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I decided to set up my own school and</v>

463
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I got a group of people together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we started trying to set it up.</v>

464
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Now this was not easy because I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people who hated me.</v>

465
00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I still have a lot of people know</v>

466
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:02.623
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I do think the number's probably </v>

467
00:20:03.961 --> 00:20:07.050
<v Speaker 1>reduced or at least they've just left me</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

468
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the numbers reduced.</v>

469
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:09.264
<v Speaker 1>I think they just leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at some point they see that you </v>

470
00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:12.210
<v Speaker 1>keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

471
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Keep becoming successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll always find someone new</v>

472
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:17.650
<v Speaker 1>to feed them into scare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like they,</v>

473
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at some point they're like,</v>

474
00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:21.170
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't got her yet.</v>

475
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.230
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they run out.</v>

476
00:20:22.231 --> 00:20:23.064
<v Speaker 1>They're not into hard work really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of are like possibly an </v>

477
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.390
<v Speaker 1>easier target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

478
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

479
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I am a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's harder now because I'm,</v>

480
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.490
<v Speaker 1>because I have the school and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

481
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Although they do try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

482
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 1>when we were trying to set up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

483
00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I was used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>

484
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:41.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're like making nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs.</v>

485
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing is setting up a school.</v>

486
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean we would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would,</v>

487
00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:49.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have parents evenings.</v>

488
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 1>So first of all I'd be out in the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>handing out flyers,</v>

489
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 1>a running into hairdressers and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does anybody have any children who might</v>

490
00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 1>want to go to the secondary school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

491
00:20:57.281 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 1>women will be coming out of their hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>dryers saying,</v>

492
00:20:58.961 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have one,</v>

493
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:03.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll have one going into churches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mosques and temples and all sorts.</v>

494
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:04.443
<v Speaker 1>And then we would have a parent's </v>
<v Speaker 1>evening once we had it in the pub and </v>

495
00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:11.410
<v Speaker 1>all these parents were driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our detractors are outside picketing.</v>

496
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.030
<v Speaker 1>They've got posters that saying Tory </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher,</v>

497
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of insults.</v>

498
00:21:17.681 --> 00:21:18.514
<v Speaker 1>The screaming obscenities at me calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>me names and we have to hire a bouncer </v>

499
00:21:22.241 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 1>because we were so worried about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible violence.</v>

500
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.473
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when I was talking to the </v>

501
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:29.740
<v Speaker 1>parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these should parents finding out about a</v>

502
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

503
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 1>And they're all poor parents from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inner city,</v>

504
00:21:32.861 --> 00:21:33.694
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got all these black mom's </v>

505
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:36.940
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single mums sitting there trying to find</v>

506
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:39.670
<v Speaker 1>out about this new school and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>white middle class people.</v>

507
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:42.010
<v Speaker 1>And when we say middle class we mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with money.</v>

508
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 1>You guys can use it as a working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>

509
00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:47.530
<v Speaker 1>when we say middle class you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys say middle class.</v>

510
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:48.364
<v Speaker 1>We mean working class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I say middle class I mean well off </v>

511
00:21:49.991 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these white,</v>

512
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well educated,</v>

513
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:57.170
<v Speaker 1>well off people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have infiltrated on,</v>

514
00:21:57.171 --> 00:22:00.010
<v Speaker 1>are sitting amongst all of these inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>city people,</v>

515
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are wanting to find out about the </v>

516
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I'm talking they're standing up</v>

517
00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:05.584
<v Speaker 1>and shouting abuse deliberately because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to disrupt kinda like </v>

518
00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 1>when you do stuff and like the shaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>pennies.</v>

519
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:11.583
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about that because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know you had a little criticism of the </v>

520
00:22:13.251 --> 00:22:15.900
<v Speaker 2>way I dealt with one of the issues that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are related to education.</v>

521
00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:17.240
<v Speaker 2>We'll we'll get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

522
00:22:17.241 --> 00:22:18.074
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just focus on that for a </v>

523
00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:19.754
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it is about the </v>

524
00:22:20.481 --> 00:22:23.390
<v Speaker 2>intentions of those people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try not to judge people's intentions.</v>

525
00:22:23.391 --> 00:22:25.220
<v Speaker 2>I try to judge their actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bees,</v>

526
00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.413
<v Speaker 2>these working class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know you're not into identity </v>

527
00:22:29.031 --> 00:22:30.380
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they happened to be white,</v>

528
00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:31.214
<v Speaker 2>which you're illustrating here that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the ones that are attacking the </v>

529
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.870
<v Speaker 2>black mothers that are trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of their kids.</v>

530
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.070
<v Speaker 2>What is it that these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think they really think?</v>

531
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.263
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think they really are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>invested in keeping everything the way </v>

532
00:22:44.361 --> 00:22:45.390
<v Speaker 2>it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll domain.</v>

533
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.380
<v Speaker 2>They'll say that they're for helping </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people all the time.</v>

534
00:22:48.381 --> 00:22:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Then they'll look at a system that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>not help these people.</v>

535
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Then someone comes in and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to help these people.</v>

536
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.840
<v Speaker 2>There's a track record of doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they hate you and them.</v>

537
00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:57.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

538
00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:58.443
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

539
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so just so I'm clear,</v>

540
00:23:00.371 --> 00:23:01.990
<v Speaker 1>these are white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well off people,</v>

541
00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are people who are,</v>

542
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:03.993
<v Speaker 1>who have everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them have been privately </v>

543
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:06.400
<v Speaker 1>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

544
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.463
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because they believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>making people equal that the state </v>

545
00:23:10.721 --> 00:23:11.554
<v Speaker 1>should make people equal as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving people equality of opportunity </v>

546
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.170
<v Speaker 1>because I'm all about giving people </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of opportunity.</v>

547
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.063
<v Speaker 1>I want to make it so that schools are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>good that everybody has an equal chance </v>

548
00:23:22.541 --> 00:23:25.690
<v Speaker 1>of making something of themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing their stores.</v>

549
00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to do.</v>

550
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.790
<v Speaker 1>They don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want these people to continue being</v>

551
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.190
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not being successful.</v>

552
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And then they as kind of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these white knights in shining armor can</v>

553
00:23:38.051 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Speaker 1>come down and the state can provide you </v>
<v Speaker 1>with money and,</v>

554
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a free apartment and,</v>

555
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.230
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of things.</v>

556
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Speaker 1>And then they can sit at parties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel very good about themselves because,</v>

557
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I vote on the left and I'm a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person to run if it works.</v>

559
00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.173
<v Speaker 1>But this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not interested in whether or </v>

560
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:57.170
<v Speaker 1>not it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're interested in feeling good about</v>

561
00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 1>themselves and their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they genuinely believe that the state is</v>

562
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:04.400
<v Speaker 1>going to make things better for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and free schools,</v>

563
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 1>charter schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they are state schools,</v>

564
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breakup,</v>

565
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.560
<v Speaker 1>the education system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

566
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:10.394
<v Speaker 1>So the unions aren't as powerful anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they very much believe in the power </v>

567
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:14.684
<v Speaker 1>of the unions and they want them to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>their collective bargaining and if too </v>

568
00:24:18.831 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 1>many schools break out of the system and</v>
<v Speaker 1>break up the system than it,</v>

569
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.363
<v Speaker 1>it devalues that power of the unions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that they convinced </v>

570
00:24:27.791 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 1>themselves that what they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

571
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.223
<v Speaker 1>Even though there are all these poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>moms wanting to find out about another </v>

572
00:24:35.481 --> 00:24:38.150
<v Speaker 1>option for their child and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate.</v>

573
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say desperate,</v>

574
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I've had mothers crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.153
<v Speaker 1>in front of me crying saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my child to get knifed I </v>

576
00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:48.254
<v Speaker 1>don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my child to have a decent </v>

577
00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.790
<v Speaker 1>education so that maybe you'll have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to get to university.</v>

578
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I just want him to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

579
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people are.</v>

580
00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And then what they'll do is they'll deny</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

581
00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:00.710
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's the case,</v>

582
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:02.780
<v Speaker 1>that there are schools where children </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't safe,</v>

583
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.670
<v Speaker 1>they'll deny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

584
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.110
<v Speaker 1>they just lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just bold face lies about,</v>

585
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.003
<v Speaker 1>about the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what other kind of pushback did you </v>

586
00:25:12.951 --> 00:25:15.240
<v Speaker 1>get as you were creating the school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

587
00:25:15.241 --> 00:25:16.690
<v Speaker 1>what is it like to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

588
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.260
<v Speaker 1>you fill out some paperwork I assume and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you try it,</v>

589
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.113
<v Speaker 1>you talk to some people and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to some teachers that are </v>

590
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:26.260
<v Speaker 1>likeminded administrators and things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's that light to go on?</v>

591
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I got to find a building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to find funding.</v>

592
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.230
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a total nightmare.</v>

593
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Total nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

594
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.653
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever any group comes to me and says </v>

595
00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:36.860
<v Speaker 1>we want to set up a school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say,</v>

596
00:25:36.861 --> 00:25:37.880
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well dig deep,</v>

597
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.823
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're going to have to get </v>

598
00:25:39.921 --> 00:25:42.200
<v Speaker 1>every bit of energy you've got to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to push through on.</v>

599
00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:44.600
<v Speaker 1>This mean it took us three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

600
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.250
<v Speaker 1>and it took us three years to find a </v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

601
00:25:46.251 --> 00:25:48.570
<v Speaker 1>There was so many people against us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

602
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.753
<v Speaker 1>and as you were saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kept going and I mean I kind of </v>

603
00:25:51.441 --> 00:25:52.274
<v Speaker 1>had to keep going because otherwise I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't gonna be able to do the job that </v>

604
00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had to and eventually we found this</v>

605
00:25:58.131 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

606
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.000
<v Speaker 1>so first you apply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go for interviews,</v>

607
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.233
<v Speaker 1>panel interviews and Blah Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get approved and then </v>

608
00:26:04.761 --> 00:26:07.370
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for a building and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a nightmare.</v>

609
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.413
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

610
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.270
<v Speaker 1>eventually we got this building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

611
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.800
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know isn't the greatest building and</v>

612
00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:13.940
<v Speaker 1>when I say it's not great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:15.890
<v Speaker 1>there's no grass there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no trees,</v>

614
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.903
<v Speaker 1>there's no carpet for the staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just the old car park which is </v>

615
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 1>used as a playground for the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is tiny,</v>

616
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't ideal,</v>

617
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:24.763
<v Speaker 1>but I always say it's the people inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the building that matter and we've made </v>

618
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:29.840
<v Speaker 1>a real go of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

619
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:30.961
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:26:30.961 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great,</v>

621
00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:32.331
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

622
00:26:32.331 --> 00:26:33.121
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

623
00:26:33.121 --> 00:26:35.480
<v Speaker 1>and what is great and everybody really </v>
<v Speaker 1>is great.</v>

624
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.280
<v Speaker 1>And this is where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

625
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

626
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

627
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I feel really optimistic is that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

628
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.003
<v Speaker 1>10 teachers from all over the world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and visit the school every single </v>

629
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly from the UK,</v>

630
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:50.760
<v Speaker 1>but we get Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadians,</v>

631
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Australians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealanders,</v>

632
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.093
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they come because they've heard </v>

633
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:54.864
<v Speaker 1>about us through social media and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see what we do and then we get </v>

634
00:26:57.691 --> 00:26:58.524
<v Speaker 1>loads of letters from teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from principals who say I taken these </v>

635
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:05.290
<v Speaker 1>ideas and put them in my school and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really helped and it,</v>

636
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 1>and it's made things better for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

637
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like we're not just having </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact in our school,</v>

638
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:11.990
<v Speaker 1>on our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on,</v>

639
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.560
<v Speaker 1>on kids all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

640
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.633
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's really focus on what you've </v>

641
00:27:15.931 --> 00:27:19.290
<v Speaker 1>done with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kayla's school that you started in 2014.</v>

642
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.183
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the research that I was doing about </v>

643
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.370
<v Speaker 1>discipline really before you even get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

644
00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:30.450
<v Speaker 1>So you guys do a bootcamp before you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to teach them anything.</v>

645
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.313
<v Speaker 1>You're actually teaching them some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that purely about discipline and </v>

646
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.780
<v Speaker 1>sort of how to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to behave.</v>

647
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:37.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because we believe you </v>

648
00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:41.940
<v Speaker 1>haven't taught them how to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can't give them a detention for</v>

649
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:42.774
<v Speaker 1>it because they don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why they don't know how </v>

650
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.460
<v Speaker 1>is because we know that elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they haven't necessarily been taught.</v>

651
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.290
<v Speaker 1>They haven't necessarily learned that at</v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

652
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.450
<v Speaker 1>They certainly want to learn it at other</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

653
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:52.523
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because our expectations are </v>

654
00:27:53.251 --> 00:27:55.800
<v Speaker 1>really high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we teach them.</v>

655
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 1>We have silence in the car doors for </v>
<v Speaker 1>instance.</v>

656
00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's something people come and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

657
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.533
<v Speaker 1>why do you have to be so extreme?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why you had to be so </v>

658
00:28:02.701 --> 00:28:06.810
<v Speaker 1>extreme because otherwise you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids fighting in the corridors,</v>

659
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.030
<v Speaker 1>bashing each other's heads against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>

660
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.103
<v Speaker 1>Some schools where teachers are scared </v>
<v Speaker 1>to walk through the corridors because </v>

661
00:28:12.871 --> 00:28:14.790
<v Speaker 1>it's such mayhem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have silence.</v>

662
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Everybody just moves really quickly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lessons.</v>

663
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.350
<v Speaker 1>You've got changeover that takes maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute and a half.</v>

664
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Children aren't losing loads of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>from their lessons.</v>

665
00:28:21.871 --> 00:28:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I always say 59 minutes out of every 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes in the lesson,</v>

666
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you've got it at Mckayla and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to catch them up,</v>

667
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of our kids come to us for the </v>

668
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 1>reading age of a five year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six year old when they are 11 years old.</v>

669
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.060
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

670
00:28:33.061 --> 00:28:33.894
<v Speaker 1>some of them aren't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are oxbridge material and </v>

671
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:37.164
<v Speaker 1>we'll go to Oxford or Cambridge and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them need real help so that they </v>

672
00:28:39.811 --> 00:28:40.644
<v Speaker 1>don't leave school illiterate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>innumerate 20 percent of the kids in a </v>

673
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Britain leaves school illiterate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>innumerate right?</v>

674
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Twenty percent one out of five kids now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's functionally.</v>

675
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:55.000
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like they can read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't really read.</v>

676
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.370
<v Speaker 1>And this is happening across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

677
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.293
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's become normal to expect that </v>

678
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.840
<v Speaker 1>now none of our kids going to be in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>position because,</v>

679
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we teach them so.</v>

680
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:07.643
<v Speaker 1>And we teach them in an environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the children are able to respect </v>

681
00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:11.730
<v Speaker 1>their teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They loved their teachers.</v>

682
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:14.550
<v Speaker 1>They thank them for their lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of their lessons,</v>

683
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.490
<v Speaker 1>they say good morning and good afternoon</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>

684
00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:19.980
<v Speaker 1>and things that you would never imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

685
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:20.814
<v Speaker 1>inner city kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

686
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

687
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an idea in your head of what</v>

688
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Nancy kids are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine the boys walking with their,</v>

689
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.190
<v Speaker 1>with the trousers down here in that box </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of way and,</v>

690
00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:30.243
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and girls dressing in a way that isn't </v>

691
00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:32.910
<v Speaker 1>appropriate at our school.</v>

692
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.120
<v Speaker 1>None of that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do have a dress code,</v>

693
00:29:36.121 --> 00:29:36.781
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

694
00:29:36.781 --> 00:29:39.060
<v Speaker 1>they have a uniform uniform and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal in Britain.</v>

695
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:39.894
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has a uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing we actually stick to the </v>

696
00:29:42.521 --> 00:29:44.650
<v Speaker 1>uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go elsewhere there,</v>

697
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:47.090
<v Speaker 1>the ties it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shirts around and talked.</v>

698
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 1>They look like a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk like a gangster.</v>

699
00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm always saying to the kids if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

700
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 1>if they ever start bumping like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say you look like a gangster.</v>

701
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:56.260
<v Speaker 1>You need to start that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

702
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.140
<v Speaker 1>and they get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

703
00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:57.401
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

704
00:29:57.401 --> 00:29:57.771
<v Speaker 1>Miss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

705
00:29:57.771 --> 00:29:58.391
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

706
00:29:58.391 --> 00:29:59.224
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they stopped doing it because </v>

707
00:30:00.161 --> 00:30:02.140
<v Speaker 1>we talk about getting to the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

708
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.123
<v Speaker 1>we want you to get the Ivy League </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities to get to Russell Group </v>

709
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 1>universities in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we want you to have,</v>

710
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you aim for the moon,</v>

711
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you'll land amongst the stars.</v>

712
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.080
<v Speaker 1>That's where we think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

713
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And so they're all really ambitious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all working hard.</v>

714
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Why anyone would be against this as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

715
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear pushback against that,</v>

716
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:23.434
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's that people think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumptuous or something to imply that </v>

717
00:30:26.711 --> 00:30:27.544
<v Speaker 1>their parents can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if often the parents are failing </v>

718
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.183
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the parents just have to work too </v>

719
00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:35.170
<v Speaker 1>hard and they don't have time to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you're doing.</v>

720
00:30:35.171 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think when people think there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>racial element to that.</v>

721
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.510
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you even address that,</v>

722
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I actually think they have a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it itself.</v>

723
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.060
<v Speaker 1>They don't like the idea of us being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

724
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.110
<v Speaker 1>They don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think being an authority means that</v>

725
00:30:50.111 --> 00:30:52.750
<v Speaker 1>we must be Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been called not a Nazi many a time,</v>

726
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:53.584
<v Speaker 1>which is a bit ironic when you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what the Nazis would have done to </v>

727
00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:56.494
<v Speaker 1>somebody like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but exactly so and they don't like the </v>

728
00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 1>idea of us being in authority and us </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in charge.</v>

729
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:10.300
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one we're really key on discipline,</v>

730
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:11.134
<v Speaker 1>but two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want the discipline so that we can </v>

731
00:31:12.731 --> 00:31:13.564
<v Speaker 1>teach them properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is where you referring to what </v>

732
00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.773
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching you at the Oxford Union </v>

733
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:21.400
<v Speaker 1>and you'd said how about how kids need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be taught properly?</v>

734
00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:22.234
<v Speaker 1>And I was and you'd said they need to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught critical thinking and take me to </v>

735
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:29.140
<v Speaker 1>task the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

736
00:31:29.141 --> 00:31:30.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>

737
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.960
<v Speaker 1>is that you can't teach critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

738
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are critical in their thinking or</v>

739
00:31:38.861 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 1>independently minded or inquisitive when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know lots about something.</v>

740
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's only by knowing lots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the 10,000</v>

741
00:31:47.771 --> 00:31:48.610
<v Speaker 1>hour thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

742
00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:50.140
<v Speaker 1>you got Malcolm Gladwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got,</v>

743
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs,</v>

744
00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:54.010
<v Speaker 1>you got the Beatles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spend a lot of time doing something.</v>

745
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 1>You will get really good at it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to break the rules,</v>

746
00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.320
<v Speaker 1>but if you're trying to break the rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

747
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.090
<v Speaker 1>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't know anything,</v>

748
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.560
<v Speaker 1>then you end up with kids.</v>

749
00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.513
<v Speaker 1>And this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the public don't realize just how bad </v>

750
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:08.830
<v Speaker 1>things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where kids don't know where Paris is,</v>

751
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:09.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids don't know in Britain who Winston </v>

752
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Churchill is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

753
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.313
<v Speaker 1>they genuinely have no idea and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nobody's taught them because </v>

754
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:18.873
<v Speaker 1>people are anti knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the grandfather to like the whole </v>

755
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:22.720
<v Speaker 1>knowledge movement is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

756
00:32:22.721 --> 00:32:23.471
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ed Hirsch,</v>

757
00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:24.304
<v Speaker 1>and he's an American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His most recent book is why knowledge </v>

758
00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:26.854
<v Speaker 1>matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would encourage all of your </v>

759
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.430
<v Speaker 1>viewers to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

760
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education is the most important thing in</v>

761
00:32:34.361 --> 00:32:35.260
<v Speaker 1>any country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

762
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.460
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

763
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.353
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the reasons I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleased to be talking to you because </v>

764
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.940
<v Speaker 1>people need to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

765
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:41.621
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

766
00:32:41.621 --> 00:32:44.780
<v Speaker 1>you can have all your arguments about </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech and about,</v>

767
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.040
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

768
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.903
<v Speaker 1>guns and about whatever it is you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the schools are not teaching </v>

769
00:32:51.321 --> 00:32:54.950
<v Speaker 1>children properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that is the end of any country,</v>

770
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

771
00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:00.740
<v Speaker 1>And I'm desperately trying to shout as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as I can the Dell people to that we</v>

772
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:04.460
<v Speaker 1>need to do something and we are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

773
00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing something.</v>

774
00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:07.010
<v Speaker 1>And other people that were not the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>

775
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:07.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other people who were doing </v>

776
00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:09.920
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We named Mckayla,</v>

777
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Mckayla after a woman who died of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>

778
00:33:12.321 --> 00:33:13.154
<v Speaker 1>who I used to work with and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she and her own classroom used to do </v>

779
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:16.994
<v Speaker 1>exactly this and there are teachers all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over America and all over Britain doing </v>

780
00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:23.780
<v Speaker 1>this in their own classrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need,</v>

781
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.250
<v Speaker 1>we need it to be more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need entire school districts.</v>

782
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need people to get this point.</v>

783
00:33:30.291 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 1>And when you said about teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical thinking,</v>

784
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a romantic view that comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rousseau.</v>

785
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 18th century philosopher,</v>

786
00:33:38.511 --> 00:33:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Rousseau and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

787
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.360
<v Speaker 1>a man is born free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everywhere and chains.</v>

788
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.920
<v Speaker 1>This whole idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

789
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:46.960
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

790
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you education makes you less free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what the,</v>

791
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the progressive thing.</v>

792
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.350
<v Speaker 1>And actually it selfcontrol brings you </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>

793
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:59.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's counterintuitive,</v>

794
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.440
<v Speaker 1>but actually order and structure make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you free.</v>

795
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.540
<v Speaker 1>They allow you to pursue all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>avenues of knowledge basically.</v>

796
00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have sort of center.</v>

797
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you learn lots about something,</v>

798
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.940
<v Speaker 1>then you're able to apply that knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>in different ways.</v>

799
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.890
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an example,</v>

800
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

801
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.353
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a math question that a </v>

802
00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:24.650
<v Speaker 1>primary school kid might be given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

803
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John has eight cents at the end of the </v>

804
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.393
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one quarter of what he had at the </v>

805
00:34:29.331 --> 00:34:30.164
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much money did he spend during the </v>

806
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.190
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think I can do it,</v>

807
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:39.170
<v Speaker 1>and I think you can too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you can do it,</v>

808
00:34:39.171 --> 00:34:40.004
<v Speaker 1>is because you've got short term memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and long term memory and you've got a </v>

809
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:47.150
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of math facts in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm memory that you're able to draw</v>

810
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:47.300
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

811
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.130
<v Speaker 1>You're able to go quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

812
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:49.964
<v Speaker 1>there's four of those in a hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're able to go four times </v>

813
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.680
<v Speaker 1>eight because I know my four times </v>
<v Speaker 1>tables and I can take it to 32.</v>

814
00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.793
<v Speaker 1>And then I can do subtraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can take it to 24 right now if </v>

815
00:35:01.911 --> 00:35:03.200
<v Speaker 1>you're seven years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

816
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.990
<v Speaker 1>if you have to hold all those facts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your working memory,</v>

817
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.100
<v Speaker 1>working memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do it.</v>

818
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.660
<v Speaker 1>You have got to drill and practice those</v>
<v Speaker 1>timetable facts,</v>

819
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.503
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put them into your longterm memory </v>

820
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:13.993
<v Speaker 1>and put those fractions into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm memory so that when somebody </v>

821
00:35:16.101 --> 00:35:18.500
<v Speaker 1>gives you something more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go Bam,</v>

822
00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

823
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.710
<v Speaker 1>bring it out and then you've got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

824
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is people say,</v>

825
00:35:24.741 --> 00:35:26.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we need to do is teach them complex</v>

826
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 1>problem solving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's give them that first.</v>

827
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:30.710
<v Speaker 1>You got to break it down.</v>

828
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.230
<v Speaker 1>What are the bits underneath that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to build up from?</v>

829
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:38.590
<v Speaker 1>And that stuff is a bit boring because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's boring and isn't very romantic.</v>

830
00:35:38.791 --> 00:35:41.610
<v Speaker 1>This bag was talking about Rizzo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Russo,</v>

831
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 1>this idea with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

832
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:44.430
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring it out of the child,</v>

833
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have this phrase which says,</v>

834
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind is not a vessel to be filled,</v>

835
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:50.303
<v Speaker 1>but a spark to be ignited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it all sounds really exciting and </v>

836
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:54.114
<v Speaker 1>thrilling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

837
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so seductive it,</v>

838
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:57.503
<v Speaker 1>it pulls everybody in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is that actually what </v>

839
00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 1>you need is a whole lot of facts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

840
00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:05.490
<v Speaker 1>in your memory there that you can then </v>
<v Speaker 1>go boom,</v>

841
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom and apply.</v>

842
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.493
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that you're just a </v>

843
00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:10.890
<v Speaker 1>parrot and you just end up learning a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole load of facts,</v>

844
00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:13.230
<v Speaker 1>which you then can just regurgitate.</v>

845
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:14.303
<v Speaker 1>You need to apply them and you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give children the chance to apply them </v>

846
00:36:16.261 --> 00:36:17.094
<v Speaker 1>and have a class discussion and we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>paired work and selling often in more </v>

847
00:36:21.031 --> 00:36:22.770
<v Speaker 1>progressive places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll do group work,</v>

848
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 1>they'll put five kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four kids around the table,</v>

849
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:26.783
<v Speaker 1>and they do group work and then what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is the teacher moves amongst </v>

850
00:36:29.431 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 1>them as a facilitator of learning as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to the teacher who's driving the</v>

851
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:34.920
<v Speaker 1>bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say the teacher needs to sit in</v>

852
00:36:34.921 --> 00:36:38.250
<v Speaker 1>the bus and drive and the kids get on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bus with you and go.</v>

853
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.630
<v Speaker 1>The more progressive way your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just keeping them on task.</v>

854
00:36:42.631 --> 00:36:44.100
<v Speaker 1>You do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me come and see you.</v>

855
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:44.934
<v Speaker 1>You do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they learn very much and then they </v>

856
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:51.180
<v Speaker 1>don't succeed and then we say it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were black.</v>

857
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:52.014
<v Speaker 1>It's because they were poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we need to do is give them welfare </v>

858
00:36:54.241 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 1>and then there'll be okay because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will make them equal and my point is no.</v>

859
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:58.703
<v Speaker 1>Fix the education system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them an education and then they'll </v>

860
00:37:00.661 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 1>make themselves equal.</v>

861
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this reminds me of.</v>

862
00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:07.030
<v Speaker 2>So I mentioned that I'm not that good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>math and I remember the day,</v>

863
00:37:07.031 --> 00:37:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I haven't thought about this in probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>

864
00:37:08.921 --> 00:37:09.390
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

865
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.223
<v Speaker 2>maybe literally maybe 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember being in sixth or seventh </v>

866
00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:13.564
<v Speaker 2>grade and we were doing division for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time and I remember the teacher </v>

867
00:37:17.141 --> 00:37:17.974
<v Speaker 2>gave us a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a quiz or something and I was </v>

868
00:37:19.961 --> 00:37:22.600
<v Speaker 2>able to do it in my head and I saw they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

869
00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the equation and I just wrote the answer</v>

870
00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.193
<v Speaker 2>and she gave me a fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I failed or I got a zero or something </v>

871
00:37:28.601 --> 00:37:31.270
<v Speaker 2>even though I had all the answers right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said you didn't show your work.</v>

872
00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:33.700
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember seeing her,</v>

873
00:37:33.701 --> 00:37:35.650
<v Speaker 2>but I got all the answers right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she said,</v>

874
00:37:35.651 --> 00:37:36.020
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

875
00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.390
<v Speaker 2>I need to see how you do you work now.</v>

876
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:38.223
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to do it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somehow I was able to do it in my </v>

877
00:37:40.841 --> 00:37:41.674
<v Speaker 2>head and I remember thinking that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was all necessary to show the work </v>

878
00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.690
<v Speaker 2>that at some point I would get to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place where I would have to do it.</v>

879
00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.810
<v Speaker 2>But somehow I had figured out my little </v>
<v Speaker 2>trick first.</v>

880
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:57.100
<v Speaker 2>But because of the way she kinda just </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed me for it,</v>

881
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.750
<v Speaker 2>he completely turned me off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

882
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I literally haven't done that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 20 years or something.</v>

883
00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.320
<v Speaker 2>That's a total sidebar all together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess it just goes to show that we</v>

884
00:38:05.321 --> 00:38:07.120
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all kind of learn differently and you</v>

885
00:38:07.121 --> 00:38:07.954
<v Speaker 2>need teachers that can kind of embrace </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you do it a little bit rather </v>

886
00:38:11.951 --> 00:38:13.960
<v Speaker 2>than just jam it down your throat.</v>

887
00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you,</v>

888
00:38:15.511 --> 00:38:16.340
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

889
00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:20.120
<v Speaker 2>which is probably a little bit of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive thing that you don't like in</v>

890
00:38:20.121 --> 00:38:20.640
<v Speaker 2>a way.</v>

891
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I would say is,</v>

892
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:26.580
<v Speaker 1>you remember that particular incident </v>
<v Speaker 1>and think that's all it was,</v>

893
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:29.850
<v Speaker 1>but I guarantee you that had you been </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught properly in the classroom,</v>

894
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have known her methods.</v>

895
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.113
<v Speaker 1>You would have known what to write down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know what to write down </v>

896
00:38:35.141 --> 00:38:37.480
<v Speaker 1>because there was too much chaos in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom.</v>

897
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.553
<v Speaker 1>You weren't listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were busy talking to your friend </v>

898
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.313
<v Speaker 1>because she let you talk because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have high enough standards of </v>

899
00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:46.340
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds brilliant.</v>

900
00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

901
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.050
<v Speaker 1>and that's it because this is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>

902
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.910
<v Speaker 1>This is just what happens in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>classrooms.</v>

903
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.250
<v Speaker 1>And then people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

904
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:59.550
<v Speaker 1>it's mean to make kids behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after awhile,</v>

905
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.453
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that remember there's more of them </v>

906
00:39:02.111 --> 00:39:03.850
<v Speaker 1>than there is of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

907
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.940
<v Speaker 1>So we're not actually making them do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything they want to behave.</v>

908
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.670
<v Speaker 1>We're just creating an environment where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're able to do it.</v>

909
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.500
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm now there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

910
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:13.503
<v Speaker 1>there's the 10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the 10 percent on the outskirts </v>

911
00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 1>that the detentions and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep them in line,</v>

912
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:18.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

913
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 1>but the vast majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need that tipping point,</v>

914
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.760
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority buy in to what we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you come visit our school,</v>

915
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.280
<v Speaker 1>the kids will say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

916
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:29.950
<v Speaker 1>it's super strict and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get the tensions,</v>

917
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.813
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a great education and that's what </v>

918
00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:33.694
<v Speaker 1>I want because I want the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to change my stars and if you </v>

919
00:39:37.631 --> 00:39:38.464
<v Speaker 1>believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you believe in equality of </v>

920
00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:40.564
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sadly I think too many people in </v>

921
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:46.780
<v Speaker 1>education don't believe in equality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity and if you do,</v>

922
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:47.853
<v Speaker 1>then you want to provide an environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're going to be able to do </v>

923
00:39:50.201 --> 00:39:52.510
<v Speaker 1>that and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

924
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.650
<v Speaker 1>and that's what we do and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

925
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.493
<v Speaker 1>and I really hope those teachers would </v>
<v Speaker 1>come and visit us that they're able to </v>

926
00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.340
<v Speaker 1>take from that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

927
00:39:59.341 --> 00:40:00.820
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do something in their schools.</v>

928
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well first off,</v>

929
00:40:02.011 --> 00:40:02.844
<v Speaker 2>I told you before we started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be in the UK with Jordan </v>

930
00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Peterson for a couple of stops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I will do everything I can to stop by</v>

931
00:40:07.681 --> 00:40:10.170
<v Speaker 2>and maybe I can get Jordan to swing by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

932
00:40:10.171 --> 00:40:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his daughter is Mckayla by the way.</v>

933
00:40:12.121 --> 00:40:12.954
<v Speaker 2>So there's a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful thing happened is even </v>

934
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:16.760
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

935
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:17.843
<v Speaker 2>what about the type of kids you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've mentioned that there's some </v>

936
00:40:19.981 --> 00:40:21.760
<v Speaker 2>diversity in the type of kids that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in.</v>

937
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:22.594
<v Speaker 2>How do you guys decide who actually can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can cut it and who can afford it and </v>

938
00:40:27.541 --> 00:40:28.321
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

939
00:40:28.321 --> 00:40:29.031
<v Speaker 2>all of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

940
00:40:29.031 --> 00:40:33.120
<v Speaker 2>it's not just who comes to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the local council that kind of send</v>

941
00:40:33.121 --> 00:40:34.940
<v Speaker 2>kids to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

942
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.823
<v Speaker 2>so they decide who goes into a lottery </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people apply and then they get </v>

943
00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:41.800
<v Speaker 2>picked out of a hat literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

944
00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.560
<v Speaker 2>and then they come on.</v>

945
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Some of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

946
00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.100
<v Speaker 2>some of the kids had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up with us,</v>

947
00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.670
<v Speaker 2>didn't even necessarily want to be with </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

948
00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just end up being pushed towards us</v>

949
00:40:51.181 --> 00:40:52.950
<v Speaker 2>because that's the way the system goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

950
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:54.360
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even understand the system,</v>

951
00:40:54.361 --> 00:40:56.760
<v Speaker 2>but we had a bunch of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got a hundred and 20 kids in every</v>

952
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.593
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a pure lottery to get to the </v>

953
00:40:58.681 --> 00:41:01.740
<v Speaker 2>school basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they don't win the lottery,</v>

954
00:41:01.741 --> 00:41:02.574
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just going into the public </v>

955
00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:06.660
<v Speaker 2>school because at that point most likely</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parents can't afford private school.</v>

956
00:41:06.661 --> 00:41:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

957
00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:07.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

958
00:41:07.611 --> 00:41:08.444
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely the parents can afford a </v>

959
00:41:08.811 --> 00:41:09.980
<v Speaker 1>private school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no,</v>

960
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about it as if we're different.</v>

961
00:41:11.811 --> 00:41:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean like we're just another school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's loads of schools like us in that</v>

962
00:41:16.251 --> 00:41:18.140
<v Speaker 1>sense around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

963
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean we are a free school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

964
00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:23.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

965
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not like we're the free school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's the local public school,</v>

966
00:41:26.991 --> 00:41:29.540
<v Speaker 1>there's loads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of schools and um,</v>

967
00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.060
<v Speaker 1>and parents will choose us if they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

968
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as I say,</v>

969
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:35.820
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we end up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

970
00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:36.693
<v Speaker 1>with kids because the system is such </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to choose your top five </v>

971
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:41.290
<v Speaker 1>schools and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've chosen us fifth,</v>

972
00:41:41.291 --> 00:41:45.580
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't want to be with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the name of fairness as,</v>

973
00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.473
<v Speaker 1>as it always goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who have chosen as fifth has </v>

974
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.030
<v Speaker 1>just as much of a chance getting in at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

975
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 1>got very American there and did it well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I grew up in Canada.</v>

976
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.300
<v Speaker 1>So it kinda changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

977
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:58.603
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people who don't want to come to us </v>

978
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:01.250
<v Speaker 1>come to us and people who do really want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come to us,</v>

979
00:42:01.251 --> 00:42:04.250
<v Speaker 1>come to us and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

980
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I call myself the dragon lady and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

981
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to change and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to put up with me,</v>

982
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 1>these are the rules and this is what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

983
00:42:13.671 --> 00:42:15.680
<v Speaker 1>So if we hear your phone or if we see </v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone,</v>

984
00:42:15.681 --> 00:42:18.500
<v Speaker 1>we'll take it and we will keep it for up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 16 weeks.</v>

985
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

986
00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these smartphones are killing kids.</v>

987
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:23.970
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

988
00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:26.240
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's an,</v>

989
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a disaster and in 20 years people </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to know,</v>

990
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say it now,</v>

991
00:42:29.301 --> 00:42:29.871
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

992
00:42:29.871 --> 00:42:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you're being extreme.</v>

993
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:31.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some schools,</v>

994
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:33.890
<v Speaker 1>they actually have these phones out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons.</v>

995
00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of schools.</v>

996
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:38.210
<v Speaker 1>They had them out in car doors and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the yard and so on.</v>

997
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.193
<v Speaker 1>We have the band completely and I'm even</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get parents to take them away </v>

998
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.550
<v Speaker 1>at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know we sell brick phone,</v>

999
00:42:44.551 --> 00:42:45.384
<v Speaker 1>so that phone that you can't access the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet so that we try and encourage </v>

1000
00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:50.420
<v Speaker 1>parents to give them that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to keep in touch with your kid.</v>

1001
00:42:50.421 --> 00:42:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

1002
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.470
<v Speaker 1>But you don't need to give them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smartphone that,</v>

1003
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.520
<v Speaker 1>that access to the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1004
00:42:55.521 --> 00:42:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates,</v>

1005
00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:58.183
<v Speaker 1>all of those big guys in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't give their children phones </v>

1006
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:03.080
<v Speaker 1>until they're 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep them away.</v>

1007
00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:07.550
<v Speaker 1>When Steve Jobs in 2010 and the ipad </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out and he was interviewed and they</v>

1008
00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:07.901
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1009
00:43:07.901 --> 00:43:09.140
<v Speaker 1>what did you think about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>

1010
00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.730
<v Speaker 1>what do your kids think about the ipad?</v>

1011
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:11.511
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1012
00:43:11.511 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't give my kids the IPAD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1013
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.860
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they protect their children.</v>

1014
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:16.783
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our parents had no idea they're saving </v>

1015
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:22.250
<v Speaker 1>up for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The give the kids this Christmas present</v>

1016
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:23.120
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1017
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.953
<v Speaker 1>it's like giving them heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say it's like playing Russian </v>

1018
00:43:25.671 --> 00:43:26.540
<v Speaker 1>roulette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1019
00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.603
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you give anybody access to your </v>

1020
00:43:30.021 --> 00:43:31.460
<v Speaker 1>child on this phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1021
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Weirdo out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows who your child lives,</v>

1022
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:35.680
<v Speaker 1>knows where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they go to school,</v>

1023
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.850
<v Speaker 1>knows where they go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows who their friends are.</v>

1024
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.020
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1025
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1026
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.493
<v Speaker 1>the reason why people do this is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know and they don't think </v>

1027
00:43:45.711 --> 00:43:48.500
<v Speaker 1>about the dangers of not just with </v>
<v Speaker 1>random people,</v>

1028
00:43:48.501 --> 00:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>but also lovely girls who get involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the bad boys at school.</v>

1029
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad boys who might be criminals </v>

1030
00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:56.340
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

1031
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.910
<v Speaker 1>And they quite liked them and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't otherwise know them,</v>

1032
00:43:58.911 --> 00:43:59.960
<v Speaker 1>but oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1033
00:43:59.961 --> 00:44:01.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's going to add me on snapchat.</v>

1034
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1035
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And this is the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>

1036
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:05.453
<v Speaker 1>What about just for attention spans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I would imagine you're dealing </v>

1037
00:44:07.581 --> 00:44:09.920
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of that from young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1038
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Massive snapchat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you just said.</v>

1039
00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1040
00:44:13.341 --> 00:44:14.930
<v Speaker 1>before when they used to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1041
00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:15.764
<v Speaker 1>dallas and dynasty and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least there was a narrative arc that </v>

1042
00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:18.973
<v Speaker 1>went like this and it told a story and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then something bad happened and then it </v>

1043
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.200
<v Speaker 1>gets resolved and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen anymore.</v>

1044
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:27.620
<v Speaker 1>You got like 22nd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the hairdresser's look at this</v>

1045
00:44:27.621 --> 00:44:30.050
<v Speaker 1>man's bolthead who ended the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>ditty.</v>

1046
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:32.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1047
00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1048
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:34.793
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So smartphones are a huge problem for </v>

1049
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:38.970
<v Speaker 1>the inner city and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest problem I would say,</v>

1050
00:44:38.971 --> 00:44:39.804
<v Speaker 1>our progressive teaching methods that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have infiltrated our schools and sadly </v>

1051
00:44:42.901 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 1>this kind of an idea that you're drawing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something out of the child as opposed to</v>

1052
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:47.604
<v Speaker 1>putting something in and the way in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which over the last 50 years we have </v>

1053
00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:54.510
<v Speaker 1>turned away from knowledge as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>really important.</v>

1054
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.160
<v Speaker 1>This hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1055
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.680
<v Speaker 1>the most vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So working class kids,</v>

1056
00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1057
00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:00.480
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our country,</v>

1058
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:01.314
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tends to be a black thing in this </v>

1059
00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:03.540
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our country,</v>

1060
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:03.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1061
00:45:03.981 --> 00:45:04.814
<v Speaker 1>in britain it'll be black kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll also be white working class </v>

1062
00:45:07.051 --> 00:45:07.884
<v Speaker 1>kids will be a variety of different kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>who get hit by this because if you are </v>

1063
00:45:11.431 --> 00:45:13.920
<v Speaker 1>from a richer background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents,</v>

1064
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit around the dinner table at night</v>

1065
00:45:15.721 --> 00:45:16.554
<v Speaker 1>and you have dinner and you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the politics of the day and you learn </v>

1066
00:45:19.411 --> 00:45:20.244
<v Speaker 1>about different countries and science </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of things just through </v>

1067
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.230
<v Speaker 1>talking to your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto your parents,</v>

1068
00:45:25.231 --> 00:45:26.880
<v Speaker 1>friends and your uncle and your aunt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

1069
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.230
<v Speaker 1>With kids whose parents are not well </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated,</v>

1070
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.213
<v Speaker 1>they don't get that at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're depending entirely on the </v>

1071
00:45:34.261 --> 00:45:37.710
<v Speaker 1>school to give them what they need to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to succeed.</v>

1072
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.800
<v Speaker 1>And sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because schools are convinced about this</v>

1073
00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:44.580
<v Speaker 1>idea of this romance around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking critically and,</v>

1074
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:46.380
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not to say we don't want them</v>

1075
00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:47.610
<v Speaker 1>thinking critically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do,</v>

1076
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.990
<v Speaker 1>but you need to give them lots of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get them to that.</v>

1077
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:55.300
<v Speaker 2>So when I said that at oxford union </v>
<v Speaker 2>about teaching critical thinking,</v>

1078
00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:57.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not that you don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical thinking,</v>

1079
00:45:57.311 --> 00:45:59.160
<v Speaker 2>of course it's that you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

1080
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.020
<v Speaker 2>that's not something to teach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least at first,</v>

1081
00:46:02.021 --> 00:46:02.854
<v Speaker 2>it's that you have to give them all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>breath of knowledge first and then they </v>

1082
00:46:05.591 --> 00:46:09.250
<v Speaker 2>will learn how to critically think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>overplays issues.</v>

1083
00:46:09.251 --> 00:46:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like criticism,</v>

1084
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:14.730
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1085
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:16.223
<v Speaker 1>it's something that we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you having to fight all over the place </v>

1086
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.863
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's that idea of giving them that </v>

1087
00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:22.860
<v Speaker 1>equality of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>

1088
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.520
<v Speaker 1>which is what I call I keep coming back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to because I'm.</v>

1089
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen any instances where this </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work?</v>

1090
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:34.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean have there been kids that come </v>
<v Speaker 2>through and just for whatever reason,</v>

1091
00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.350
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this concept that,</v>

1092
00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.770
<v Speaker 2>that you've built that you're instilling</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all these other students,</v>

1093
00:46:39.771 --> 00:46:40.604
<v Speaker 2>it just does not work for them either </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of something about them or the </v>

1094
00:46:43.431 --> 00:46:44.260
<v Speaker 2>family or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1095
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.510
<v Speaker 1>So I've had to exclude a few children </v>
<v Speaker 1>for knives,</v>

1096
00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.373
<v Speaker 1>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's something in the inner city </v>

1097
00:46:48.191 --> 00:46:48.941
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1098
00:46:48.941 --> 00:46:50.470
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1099
00:46:50.471 --> 00:46:52.480
<v Speaker 1>we've got kids showing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1100
00:46:52.481 --> 00:46:55.060
<v Speaker 1>young men showing up on bikes with </v>
<v Speaker 1>masks,</v>

1101
00:46:55.061 --> 00:46:57.340
<v Speaker 1>carrying knives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting to meet some of our kids,</v>

1102
00:46:57.341 --> 00:46:58.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1103
00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:58.953
<v Speaker 1>this is the inner city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are some of those issues that </v>

1104
00:47:02.561 --> 00:47:03.910
<v Speaker 1>can take over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1105
00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:04.930
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1106
00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that it hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked.</v>

1107
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.233
<v Speaker 1>It always works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids always learn more than they've </v>

1108
00:47:08.831 --> 00:47:12.460
<v Speaker 1>ever learned anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids always are stunned by their own</v>

1109
00:47:12.461 --> 00:47:14.940
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and what is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1110
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:17.680
<v Speaker 1>because we show that to them and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1111
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what kind of breaks my heart is that</v>

1112
00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.420
<v Speaker 1>even those who are conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have a,</v>

1113
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I watch all your programs and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these great people to come on,</v>

1114
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:28.690
<v Speaker 1>but nobody ever talks about education.</v>

1115
00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:29.380
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>larry,</v>

1116
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.390
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I love and I think he's brilliant.</v>

1117
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.740
<v Speaker 1>He talks about all these things play in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the black community and he has all these</v>

1118
00:47:34.741 --> 00:47:35.574
<v Speaker 1>stats that he always comes out with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's that thing where he takes </v>

1119
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:38.164
<v Speaker 1>you apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1120
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:43.550
<v Speaker 1>normally real moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

1121
00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.430
<v Speaker 1>but what he doesn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talks about absent fathers,</v>

1122
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.080
<v Speaker 1>talks about crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about drugs and so on,</v>

1123
00:47:48.081 --> 00:47:51.080
<v Speaker 1>but they never talk about education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is education.</v>

1124
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:52.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what black people's fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1125
00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:53.683
<v Speaker 1>That isn't that the state and the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be held to account for this </v>

1126
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:59.383
<v Speaker 1>because we spend in britain 80 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds a year on the state education </v>

1127
00:48:04.101 --> 00:48:06.800
<v Speaker 1>system and yet we are failing all of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

1128
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.130
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1129
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.930
<v Speaker 1>we and larry elder and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who talk,</v>

1130
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:13.970
<v Speaker 1>they need to be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1131
00:48:13.971 --> 00:48:14.600
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1132
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.630
<v Speaker 1>There's something going wrong at a verY </v>
<v Speaker 1>low level because you can,</v>

1133
00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:19.850
<v Speaker 1>you can talk all you want about personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

1134
00:48:19.851 --> 00:48:20.684
<v Speaker 1>But if you haven't got an education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to make anything of your </v>

1135
00:48:22.761 --> 00:48:24.910
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is the problem then that in,</v>

1136
00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.640
<v Speaker 1>at least in the american context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer always is throw more money at</v>

1137
00:48:28.641 --> 00:48:31.130
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not the real answer,</v>

1138
00:48:31.131 --> 00:48:34.010
<v Speaker 1>which obviously we've spent 45 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

1139
00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:36.590
<v Speaker 1>which is why and how you have to clean </v>
<v Speaker 1>up these schools.</v>

1140
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:37.603
<v Speaker 1>But the easy answer is always throw more</v>
<v Speaker 1>money at it if they just need more </v>

1141
00:48:39.741 --> 00:48:40.191
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1142
00:48:40.191 --> 00:48:40.971
<v Speaker 1>you always hear these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

1143
00:48:40.971 --> 00:48:42.680
<v Speaker 1>they don't have enough pencils and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have enough,</v>

1144
00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:44.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1145
00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:48.260
<v Speaker 1>other supplies and notebooks and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people don't take the next step,</v>

1146
00:48:48.261 --> 00:48:50.070
<v Speaker 1>which would be the critical thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>step up.</v>

1147
00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not about money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can throw money at anything.</v>

1148
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:53.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:48:53.031 --> 00:48:55.010
<v Speaker 1>The irony is they all go on about </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical thinking.</v>

1150
00:48:55.011 --> 00:48:56.740
<v Speaker 1>They're not doing any critical thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1151
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:58.130
<v Speaker 1>if only they would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1152
00:48:58.131 --> 00:48:59.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1153
00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I wish you luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1154
00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:01.061
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1155
00:49:01.061 --> 00:49:04.340
<v Speaker 1>the left really refused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They refused to recognize there's even a</v>

1156
00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:05.660
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1157
00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.820
<v Speaker 1>the right will recognize that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

1158
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.863
<v Speaker 1>but they don't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's What I'm saying about the </v>

1159
00:49:10.581 --> 00:49:11.414
<v Speaker 1>people who you interview and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wish more people would say </v>

1160
00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.090
<v Speaker 1>actually the solution is in education </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it really is,</v>

1161
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1162
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:20.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black community for instance.</v>

1163
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1164
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:24.980
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would transform if they were given a,</v>

1165
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.410
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to have a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

1166
00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1167
00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:31.820
<v Speaker 1>and that's not to say that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that larry elder talks about,</v>

1168
00:49:31.821 --> 00:49:33.470
<v Speaker 1>about absent fathers and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a problem,</v>

1169
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.473
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are absolutely a but it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really important to call them out on it </v>

1170
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:40.340
<v Speaker 1>and it's really important to cold out.</v>

1171
00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.560
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where I would disagree,</v>

1172
00:49:42.561 --> 00:49:44.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself a conservative and the</v>

1173
00:49:44.031 --> 00:49:44.864
<v Speaker 1>black conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would disagree with some of the </v>

1174
00:49:46.341 --> 00:49:48.980
<v Speaker 1>black conservatives out there who </v>
<v Speaker 1>refused to recognIze racism as a problem</v>

1175
00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:49.641
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1176
00:49:49.641 --> 00:49:51.830
<v Speaker 1>they kind of just dismiss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say no,</v>

1177
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.753
<v Speaker 1>it is a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason it's a big problem is </v>

1178
00:49:54.321 --> 00:49:57.770
<v Speaker 1>because the left in so many ways are </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>

1179
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they want to own us and they want </v>

1180
00:50:00.231 --> 00:50:01.064
<v Speaker 1>to tell us how we can vote and they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell us how we can think that is </v>

1181
00:50:03.621 --> 00:50:04.454
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they refuse to recognize what </v>

1182
00:50:06.501 --> 00:50:08.930
<v Speaker 1>works in education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to help poor kids,</v>

1183
00:50:08.931 --> 00:50:11.840
<v Speaker 1>black kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white working class kids in britain when</v>

1184
00:50:11.841 --> 00:50:14.150
<v Speaker 1>they refuse to look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's racist.</v>

1185
00:50:14.151 --> 00:50:15.950
<v Speaker 1>And I'd say it's racist against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>white working class.</v>

1186
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:16.783
<v Speaker 1>The way the white working class or </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken about in britain is the way that </v>

1187
00:50:18.951 --> 00:50:19.784
<v Speaker 1>sometimes black car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black communities have spoken about </v>

1188
00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:22.184
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like there's some kind of </v>

1189
00:50:23.031 --> 00:50:25.490
<v Speaker 1>different like they're aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well,</v>

1190
00:50:25.491 --> 00:50:26.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the way they are.</v>

1191
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:27.763
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the way they are actually if </v>

1192
00:50:28.461 --> 00:50:29.294
<v Speaker 1>you give them the opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will want to sit around dinner </v>

1193
00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:32.534
<v Speaker 1>parties and talk about how kind you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how great you are because your </v>

1194
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:38.180
<v Speaker 1>virtue signaling and voting on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1195
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just wish,</v>

1196
00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:40.874
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that there were more </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives who were speaking out </v>

1197
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 1>about this and saying something.</v>

1198
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:47.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's a weird reflex for them </v>

1199
00:50:49.101 --> 00:50:51.060
<v Speaker 2>where they've been called racist for so </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

1200
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Even though often they are minorities </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they don't want.</v>

1201
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:55.844
<v Speaker 2>I see this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely see this where they don't </v>

1202
00:50:57.531 --> 00:51:00.020
<v Speaker 2>want to use the same tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you just said,</v>

1203
00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:02.420
<v Speaker 2>right there is such a flip on the way we</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of racism.</v>

1204
00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:04.760
<v Speaker 2>I tend to agree with that line of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

1205
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Obviously the people that are screaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>about racism or all the time now are the</v>

1206
00:51:09.621 --> 00:51:11.750
<v Speaker 2>people who are racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are racist.</v>

1207
00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:12.623
<v Speaker 2>They really are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't say don't say that lightly </v>

1208
00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:16.010
<v Speaker 2>because I don't like calling people </v>
<v Speaker 2>faces,</v>

1209
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:20.240
<v Speaker 2>but they're the ones who are deManding </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact look at everyone based on race and</v>

1210
00:51:20.241 --> 00:51:22.610
<v Speaker 2>sexuality and the rest of this have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>call it out,</v>

1211
00:51:22.611 --> 00:51:27.611
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a hesitancy from at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least from sort of where I sit because I</v>

1212
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:32.060
<v Speaker 2>don't want to become what they became.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know,</v>

1213
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.040
<v Speaker 2>I know you're right at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the core of this</v>

1214
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:34.993
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand you don't want to say </v>

1215
00:51:35.731 --> 00:51:37.800
<v Speaker 1>everything is racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when there is real racism,</v>

1216
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:38.753
<v Speaker 1>you need to plan it out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that the fact is that if we </v>

1217
00:51:45.691 --> 00:51:46.524
<v Speaker 1>don't call it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these kids are going to keep </v>

1218
00:51:48.241 --> 00:51:49.170
<v Speaker 1>failing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1219
00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:50.403
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we don't realize is that all of </v>

1220
00:51:51.261 --> 00:51:53.550
<v Speaker 1>these kids are going through school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>are being taught,</v>

1221
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that they're going off and </v>

1222
00:51:56.091 --> 00:51:58.160
<v Speaker 1>voting on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it is like that,</v>

1223
00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.660
<v Speaker 1>that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's how everyone thinks,</v>

1224
00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:05.560
<v Speaker 1>like it's so standard in the education </v>
<v Speaker 1>system to,</v>

1225
00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:06.483
<v Speaker 1>to think on the left that the few </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative teaches that there are out </v>

1226
00:52:09.421 --> 00:52:11.520
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're quiet,</v>

1227
00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:13.650
<v Speaker 1>they never say anything because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified,</v>

1228
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1229
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:16.950
<v Speaker 1>there is no balance of ford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1230
00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:18.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1231
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:20.460
<v Speaker 1>and that's really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1232
00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a and for the future of,</v>

1233
00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:23.250
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1234
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.650
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our countries,</v>

1235
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:27.200
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need people to talk to each other,</v>

1236
00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.740
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that you're always talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1237
00:52:28.741 --> 00:52:32.790
<v Speaker 1>about talking to each other and sharing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and thinking about how the other,</v>

1238
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 1>the other side things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1239
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I worry that,</v>

1240
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

1241
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:41.730
<v Speaker 1>we don't do enough of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1242
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.010
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't do enough of at school,</v>

1243
00:52:44.011 --> 00:52:44.844
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those kids turn into adults </v>

1244
00:52:46.261 --> 00:52:48.040
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't they and them.</v>

1245
00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:50.580
<v Speaker 1>And then we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1246
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.353
<v Speaker 2>and then they're really pissed at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that they believe is failed them </v>

1247
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.730
<v Speaker 2>and then they just perpetuate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the next generation two and then</v>

1248
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.570
<v Speaker 2>eventually that's unsustainable actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>because then you have enough people that</v>

1249
00:53:02.571 --> 00:53:04.730
<v Speaker 2>are turning against the system that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed them.</v>

1250
00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:08.390
<v Speaker 2>It's bEcause no one stood up and did </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing.</v>

1251
00:53:08.391 --> 00:53:09.224
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting because this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>where a good old american classical </v>

1252
00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.700
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know you guys,</v>

1253
00:53:13.701 --> 00:53:14.534
<v Speaker 2>at least in the uk have a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what classical </v>

1254
00:53:16.311 --> 00:53:18.830
<v Speaker 2>liberalism I think that we do here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this a little bit before</v>

1255
00:53:18.831 --> 00:53:21.890
<v Speaker 2>that these words aren't getting muddled </v>
<v Speaker 2>and mangled and all that,</v>

1256
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 2>but this is a place where to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the government should be</v>

1257
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.813
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for using tax dollars to do the </v>

1258
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:32.730
<v Speaker 1>things you're talking about where some I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1259
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I think there are plenty of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are american conservatives at least that</v>

1260
00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:38.910
<v Speaker 1>want to just cut funding from all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things and endlessly cut funding.</v>

1261
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:39.833
<v Speaker 1>AS I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not for throwing money at them just </v>

1262
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:44.400
<v Speaker 1>because that's just the easy answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

1263
00:53:44.401 --> 00:53:45.234
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure out how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it we use money to empower these </v>

1264
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 1>teachers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sounds like that's exactly what</v>

1265
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1266
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.693
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the power of bad ideas at the </v>

1267
00:53:56.641 --> 00:53:58.140
<v Speaker 1>moment that over the last 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1268
00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.460
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 years ago,</v>

1269
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:03.270
<v Speaker 1>the schools that were out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're more like our school now.</v>

1270
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:05.183
<v Speaker 1>It's just that things have changed so </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically where knowledge has been </v>

1271
00:54:07.771 --> 00:54:10.290
<v Speaker 1>sidelined a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about skills.</v>

1272
00:54:10.291 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 1>People talk about skills and drawing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the child,</v>

1273
00:54:12.661 --> 00:54:13.440
<v Speaker 1>like I was saying.</v>

1274
00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.390
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

1275
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.430
<v Speaker 1>we've lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1276
00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.870
<v Speaker 1>we've lost the purpose of education and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've lost,</v>

1277
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that we have about </v>

1278
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.673
<v Speaker 1>perseverance even when it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's difficult personal </v>

1279
00:54:28.771 --> 00:54:30.240
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1280
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.760
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't bring in your homework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are responsible for that.</v>

1281
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Whereas elsewhere they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1282
00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:37.560
<v Speaker 1>well it's not your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come from a difficult family.</v>

1283
00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Difficult background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give you an excuse.</v>

1284
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:40.933
<v Speaker 1>And if you're constantly being given </v>
<v Speaker 1>those excuses and if later on getting </v>

1285
00:54:44.131 --> 00:54:46.860
<v Speaker 1>into university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are quotas and if you're likely to</v>

1286
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:49.970
<v Speaker 1>get in because you're black or your </v>
<v Speaker 1>union there,</v>

1287
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.530
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1288
00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:52.060
<v Speaker 1>there are things that allow you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1289
00:54:52.061 --> 00:54:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I tick that box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tick that box,</v>

1290
00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be able to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in with a lower score,</v>

1291
00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:58.890
<v Speaker 1>then you start setting those stanDards </v>
<v Speaker 1>for yourself.</v>

1292
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we don't,</v>

1293
00:55:00.121 --> 00:55:00.954
<v Speaker 1>we all eventually degrade the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>system because if you let someone in at </v>

1294
00:55:03.841 --> 00:55:04.674
<v Speaker 1>a lower level and then also let them get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a job at a lower level or get into grad </v>

1295
00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.630
<v Speaker 1>school at a lower level of the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a lower level.</v>

1296
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:10.441
<v Speaker 1>Everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1297
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:13.320
<v Speaker 1>that whatever you've created as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional is,</v>

1298
00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.290
<v Speaker 1>is a degraded version of whatever that </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be.</v>

1299
00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:17.280
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1300
00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is what's happening,</v>

1301
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:21.130
<v Speaker 1>sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1302
00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.053
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole campaign at the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>in britain for this to happen with </v>

1303
00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:27.030
<v Speaker 1>oxford and cambridge university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1304
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:30.960
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to essentially allow kids.</v>

1305
00:55:30.961 --> 00:55:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1306
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:32.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1307
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:33.833
<v Speaker 1>it's really sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what the reason why is because they </v>

1308
00:55:35.641 --> 00:55:35.971
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1309
00:55:35.971 --> 00:55:36.804
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't that many black kids at </v>

1310
00:55:38.341 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 1>oxford and cambridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to fix this.</v>

1311
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.430
<v Speaker 1>We do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1312
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.590
<v Speaker 1>we need to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need to fix the education system.</v>

1313
00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:44.424
<v Speaker 1>We need to fix our schools and make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're given the equality of </v>

1314
00:55:46.261 --> 00:55:47.094
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that day that I spent at oxford was </v>

1315
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:50.304
<v Speaker 1>such an absolute joy talking to so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids just in the streets and just </v>

1316
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:58.620
<v Speaker 1>everybody was so like excited to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously they were sympathetic to a</v>

1317
00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:00.900
<v Speaker 1>lot of the things that I talk about and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>

1318
00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:01.883
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get it sort of on the sciences and </v>

1319
00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:05.904
<v Speaker 1>math and that you really want to teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>them the facts on this stuff on things </v>

1320
00:56:09.391 --> 00:56:10.920
<v Speaker 1>like history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1321
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:13.260
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the facts in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are facts in history,</v>

1322
00:56:13.261 --> 00:56:14.094
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder now these days where it </v>

1323
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:16.074
<v Speaker 1>seems like young people are kind of into</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism or young people are kind of </v>

1324
00:56:19.081 --> 00:56:21.450
<v Speaker 1>into communism or marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of it,</v>

1325
00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you found that teaching history has</v>

1326
00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:27.940
<v Speaker 1>become oddly say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oddly political?</v>

1327
00:56:27.941 --> 00:56:28.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1328
00:56:28.271 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 1>of course it is political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but oddly politicized,</v>

1329
00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.550
<v Speaker 1>so like hitler for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has taught to death,</v>

1330
00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1331
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the,</v>

1332
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:38.223
<v Speaker 1>the trustees of communism and so on are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not taught so much or even then so </v>

1333
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:45.330
<v Speaker 1>rarely is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1334
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:48.550
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so little is taught full stop because</v>

1335
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:49.384
<v Speaker 1>they're not being taught properly in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom because you are facilitating </v>

1336
00:56:51.821 --> 00:56:54.010
<v Speaker 1>learning and kids are just teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1337
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean that I can't stress how much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is actually going on.</v>

1338
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>

1339
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:04.630
<v Speaker 1>things are politicized and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children are not able to access the kind</v>

1340
00:57:04.631 --> 00:57:06.550
<v Speaker 1>of education that they were able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>access before.</v>

1341
00:57:06.551 --> 00:57:07.384
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard because I'll say that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then people will just deny that that's </v>

1342
00:57:10.331 --> 00:57:11.840
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1343
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:12.903
<v Speaker 1>but you can see by if you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>university kids at university and asked </v>

1344
00:57:17.411 --> 00:57:18.940
<v Speaker 1>them what do they know about the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>

1345
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.433
<v Speaker 1>what do they think they'll tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see how much they've been </v>

1346
00:57:23.111 --> 00:57:24.550
<v Speaker 1>taught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they've been taught at school.</v>

1347
00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:25.553
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a few of them have an understanding </v>

1348
00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 1>of communism and what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1349
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's because they're not learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>it properly at school.</v>

1350
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>school is</v>

1351
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.501
<v Speaker 3>sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1352
00:57:37.501 --> 00:57:39.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1353
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I wish that there was more diversity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought amongst teachers.</v>

1354
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:45.343
<v Speaker 1>So one of the reasons why we watch a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you the ruben report is because I </v>

1355
00:57:49.311 --> 00:57:51.410
<v Speaker 1>want my staff to try and think outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the box.</v>

1356
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:52.363
<v Speaker 1>What I always say is I can predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you think about every </v>

1357
00:57:54.591 --> 00:57:55.424
<v Speaker 1>issue out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I know that you definitely voted </v>

1358
00:57:57.951 --> 00:58:01.760
<v Speaker 1>remain as opposed to brexit with regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the european union for us,</v>

1359
00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:05.690
<v Speaker 1>or if I know for sure that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>vote for corbyn,</v>

1360
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:10.720
<v Speaker 1>the leader of the labor party in britain</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if I know I'm,</v>

1361
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would have to say about a whole</v>

1362
00:58:12.681 --> 00:58:15.290
<v Speaker 1>variety of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even whaT newspaper you read,</v>

1363
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:18.890
<v Speaker 1>if I can make all these predictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with me.</v>

1364
00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:21.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm conservative on some issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

1365
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:25.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm anti guns for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro choice and pro gay marriage,</v>

1366
00:58:25.221 --> 00:58:26.054
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of things that I'm very much</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left on these other things that </v>

1367
00:58:28.341 --> 00:58:29.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm more conservative about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1368
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:30.843
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because I'm a thinking </v>

1369
00:58:31.311 --> 00:58:32.430
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1370
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classical liberal.</v>

1371
00:58:33.391 --> 00:58:34.224
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in many ways that one might </v>

1372
00:58:35.481 --> 00:58:36.800
<v Speaker 1>say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1373
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1374
00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is I just want people to think</v>

1375
00:58:42.331 --> 00:58:43.590
<v Speaker 1>outside the box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1376
00:58:43.591 --> 00:58:44.424
<v Speaker 1>And I wish teachers would and that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was more diversity of thought and there </v>

1377
00:58:46.501 --> 00:58:47.334
<v Speaker 1>is some diversity of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have to keep quiet because </v>

1378
00:58:49.861 --> 00:58:52.680
<v Speaker 1>they're terrified of making sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the right teachers.</v>

1379
00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a waY it's,</v>

1380
00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:57.120
<v Speaker 1>it's self selecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they apply,</v>

1381
00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1382
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:59.503
<v Speaker 1>there are already people who were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were somewhat thinking outside the </v>

1383
00:59:01.291 --> 00:59:02.600
<v Speaker 1>box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1384
00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.000
<v Speaker 1>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1385
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.213
<v Speaker 1>and then they come and I think being at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the school also changes their minds </v>

1386
00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.610
<v Speaker 1>about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start to think differently,</v>

1387
00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:13.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're seeing what's possible.</v>

1388
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:14.933
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can't imagine what's possible </v>

1389
00:59:16.591 --> 00:59:18.600
<v Speaker 1>with inner city kids until they come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our school.</v>

1390
00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:19.643
<v Speaker 1>I have visitors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers were visitors there nearly </v>

1391
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:21.913
<v Speaker 1>tears saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that these kids are so </v>

1392
00:59:23.301 --> 00:59:24.740
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1393
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:26.053
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're tryIng to do when the </v>

1394
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:29.780
<v Speaker 1>point the point and it happens here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1395
00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I've been to see a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I said ed hirsch,</v>

1396
00:59:31.831 --> 00:59:32.664
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the schools where they use his </v>

1397
00:59:33.711 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 1>materials and they place knowledge at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart of their curriculum.</v>

1398
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some of those schools in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bronx and in,</v>

1399
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:40.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1400
00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:45.200
<v Speaker 1>in various but queens and so on and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing a great job too.</v>

1401
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wish more of it was happening and</v>

1402
00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:48.884
<v Speaker 1>that we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could get a bigger platform to talk </v>

1403
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:54.080
<v Speaker 1>about it because it's just so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1404
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:59.690
<v Speaker 1>but people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't get that.</v>

1405
00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:00.620
<v Speaker 1>They don't get that stuff.</v>

1406
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:02.460
<v Speaker 2>You think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I do.</v>

1407
01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why these types of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>are working.</v>

1408
01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:07.180
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're half a world away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1409
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.000
<v Speaker 2>thousands of miles away and you've shown</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1410
01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:10.863
<v Speaker 2>the conversations that we're having here</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your staff and the amount of people </v>

1411
01:00:13.781 --> 01:00:15.410
<v Speaker 2>that are showing up to these live events</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1412
01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:18.220
<v Speaker 2>the amount of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>downloading these podcasts and all that,</v>

1413
01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:20.320
<v Speaker 2>it's starting to happen.</v>

1414
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:22.543
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

1415
01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1416
01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1417
01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:27.200
<v Speaker 1>there's so much to Be had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1418
01:00:27.201 --> 01:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I've known tens of thousands of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People often say,</v>

1419
01:00:29.271 --> 01:00:34.100
<v Speaker 1>why do I do what I do because I've known</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of kids who could have</v>

1420
01:00:34.101 --> 01:00:35.600
<v Speaker 1>been so much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1421
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>who could have been in a position to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change their stars and they weren't able</v>

1422
01:00:39.891 --> 01:00:40.724
<v Speaker 1>to because the state is spending so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>money on their education and isn't able </v>

1423
01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>to provide them with a decent education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1424
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's really sad.</v>

1425
01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanT you to offer.</v>

1426
01:00:51.801 --> 01:00:52.634
<v Speaker 2>So I know that I have a lot of young </v>
<v Speaker 2>people obviously that listened to this </v>

1427
01:00:54.671 --> 01:00:56.060
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>

1428
01:00:56.061 --> 01:00:57.830
<v Speaker 2>sometimes junior high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but college,</v>

1429
01:00:57.831 --> 01:00:58.664
<v Speaker 2>whatever else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just for the general young person out </v>

1430
01:01:00.201 --> 01:01:01.034
<v Speaker 2>there that's watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in a school that's not doing </v>

1431
01:01:02.901 --> 01:01:07.460
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's trying to figure out how to learn</v>

1432
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:10.850
<v Speaker 2>and think critically and get a good wide</v>
<v Speaker 2>breath of knowledge.</v>

1433
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.240
<v Speaker 2>But the situation that they're in is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you've offered here.</v>

1434
01:01:14.241 --> 01:01:17.600
<v Speaker 2>what would you say to them to just start</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it for themselves?</v>

1435
01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:20.870
<v Speaker 1>You got to take personal responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't be a victim.</v>

1436
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1437
01:01:22.101 --> 01:01:26.150
<v Speaker 1>the whole victimhood thing is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stoked all the time in schools and uh,</v>

1438
01:01:26.151 --> 01:01:28.970
<v Speaker 1>and indulged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to think it doesn't matter where</v>

1439
01:01:28.971 --> 01:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I am a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had the best luck,</v>

1440
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have loved to been able to go to</v>

1441
01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>that local private school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>

1442
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:36.943
<v Speaker 1>so what I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sit down and I'm going to </v>

1443
01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:39.494
<v Speaker 1>work and I'm going to work really hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to go to the library and </v>

1444
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find the books and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to teach myself if necessary.</v>

1445
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>And I've known kids like this who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done this,</v>

1446
01:01:46.701 --> 01:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known colleagues of mine and people</v>

1447
01:01:49.011 --> 01:01:49.910
<v Speaker 1>who I've known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

1448
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.073
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make it their business to teach </v>

1449
01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:53.174
<v Speaker 1>themselves what they need to know and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to know that knowledge is at </v>

1450
01:01:55.401 --> 01:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>the heart of it.</v>

1451
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:59.240
<v Speaker 1>You need to know lots of stuff and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can manipulate that stuff.</v>

1452
01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:00.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can be intelligent with </v>

1453
01:02:01.401 --> 01:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1454
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

1455
01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.910
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is is that it's rare that a 15</v>

1456
01:02:07.911 --> 01:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>year old takes it upon themselves to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1457
01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.900
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by definition,</v>

1458
01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:12.734
<v Speaker 1>they're exceptional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most kids need somebody to guide them </v>

1459
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>and if their parents aren't doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think the school certainly can do</v>

1460
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not the school should,</v>

1461
01:02:21.421 --> 01:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>there are people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not fair.</v>

1462
01:02:22.921 --> 01:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>School shouldn't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parents should do that.</v>

1463
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1464
01:02:26.251 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1465
01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>if welfare we're not as generous as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1466
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:31.014
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parents probably would have more </v>

1467
01:02:32.761 --> 01:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>agency and self determination about </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and the incredible catch 22,</v>

1468
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:38.183
<v Speaker 1>they would take more responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would do something and sadly the </v>

1469
01:02:41.071 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>state hits them in both ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1470
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.393
<v Speaker 1>Because it gives them the heroine of </v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare and then it suppresses them by </v>

1471
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.100
<v Speaker 1>not giving them a decent education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1472
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>and then they Sit around and they talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1473
01:02:51.781 --> 01:02:52.321
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1474
01:02:52.321 --> 01:02:53.154
<v Speaker 1>I'm a really good person because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in giving people loads of </v>

1475
01:02:54.851 --> 01:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>welfare and in having terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

1476
01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1477
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you punch somebody on one side,</v>

1478
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 1>then you punch them on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How on earth are they meant to succeed?</v>

1479
01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1480
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:07.530
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is we spend a lot of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>in tax to,</v>

1481
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.930
<v Speaker 1>to have a state and I'm a classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal,</v>

1482
01:03:09.931 --> 01:03:14.490
<v Speaker 1>so I believe in a small state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do have a state,</v>

1483
01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:17.550
<v Speaker 1>let's use it for what we can for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

1484
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.090
<v Speaker 1>but we're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1485
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:21.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's,</v>

1486
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:24.390
<v Speaker 1>that's what's really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1487
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.810
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a soul believing in this idea of</v>

1488
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:28.644
<v Speaker 1>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of opportunity and that a teaching </v>

1489
01:03:32.701 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>children's self control will make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

1490
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1491
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:38.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having,</v>

1492
01:03:38.701 --> 01:03:39.534
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ordered environment where children </v>

1493
01:03:40.711 --> 01:03:41.544
<v Speaker 1>can learn will enable them to learn lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff so that they can then be </v>

1494
01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:47.394
<v Speaker 1>motivated to do something with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives because they will make themselves </v>

1495
01:03:50.821 --> 01:03:52.410
<v Speaker 1>free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1496
01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:55.370
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by grabbing that opportunity and,</v>

1497
01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1498
01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:56.843
<v Speaker 1>and it's that agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that sense of self determination </v>

1499
01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.190
<v Speaker 1>that the conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the right,</v>

1500
01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.053
<v Speaker 1>right leaning tend to believe in more as</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to mummy state coming in and </v>

1501
01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:09.720
<v Speaker 1>looking after it for a un taking care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1502
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:12.570
<v Speaker 1>because if that's what you aspire to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what's the point of living,</v>

1503
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1504
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:16.920
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to teach dead white men,</v>

1505
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:17.873
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the big problems we have Is </v>

1506
01:04:20.221 --> 01:04:24.300
<v Speaker 1>that they don't want to teach dead white</v>
<v Speaker 1>men because they're dead white men.</v>

1507
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:25.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1508
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:26.700
<v Speaker 1>So they only want to teach.</v>

1509
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Recently we had this situation where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>in manchester.</v>

1510
01:04:29.701 --> 01:04:33.780
<v Speaker 1>These students painted over a mural of </v>
<v Speaker 1>kipling.</v>

1511
01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:34.614
<v Speaker 1>So rudyard kipling's poem was up there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they painted it over and put maya </v>

1512
01:04:37.521 --> 01:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>angelou's poem by maya angelou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm a great fan of maya angelou.</v>

1513
01:04:41.251 --> 01:04:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I think she's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1514
01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:44.363
<v Speaker 1>but one of the reasons why she's a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>writer is because she read a lot of </v>

1515
01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:47.990
<v Speaker 1>kipling and she read a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare.</v>

1516
01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.210
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said of shakespeare that she thought</v>

1517
01:04:51.211 --> 01:04:52.044
<v Speaker 1>when she first read him that he must </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been a black woman because he </v>

1518
01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:54.624
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't know he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to be a black woman to have </v>

1519
01:04:56.701 --> 01:04:58.830
<v Speaker 1>understood the plight of black women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1520
01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Because he speaks to the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition,</v>

1521
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:02.003
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's a dead white male or we don't </v>

1522
01:05:03.841 --> 01:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>want to teach him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1523
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.300
<v Speaker 1>kipling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a racist.</v>

1524
01:05:06.301 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to teach him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at our school,</v>

1525
01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:09.360
<v Speaker 1>we've got them reciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1526
01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:11.760
<v Speaker 1>the poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can keep your head when all about</v>

1527
01:05:11.761 --> 01:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>you are losing theirs and blaming it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1528
01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1529
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of it,</v>

1530
01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.880
<v Speaker 1>at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

1531
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth is yours and everything that's</v>

1532
01:05:21.671 --> 01:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's more,</v>

1533
01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>you'll be a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son and that you'll be a man,</v>

1534
01:05:25.601 --> 01:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>my son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about the women?</v>

1535
01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you not be recognizing the women</v>

1536
01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:30.383
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a day and age where men can be women </v>

1537
01:05:32.861 --> 01:05:35.340
<v Speaker 1>and women can be met and we can't allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>this poem.</v>

1538
01:05:35.341 --> 01:05:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1539
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously speaking to me too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's outrage.</v>

1540
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:39.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1541
01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's only mentioned men,</v>

1542
01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:41.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1543
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>it's the most beautiful poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our children learn it off by heart,</v>

1544
01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:45.183
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But children elsewhere will never have </v>

1545
01:05:46.631 --> 01:05:47.464
<v Speaker 1>access to kipling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now everyone needs has to be taught </v>

1546
01:05:49.631 --> 01:05:50.464
<v Speaker 1>about talk taught shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to by law you have to be taught </v>

1547
01:05:52.661 --> 01:05:53.494
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact is we indulge in </v>

1548
01:05:56.091 --> 01:05:56.924
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love shakespeare because shakespeare </v>

1549
01:05:58.751 --> 01:06:00.910
<v Speaker 1>is so beautiful and extraordinary.</v>

1550
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.580
<v Speaker 1>And just because he's a dead white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1551
01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.830
<v Speaker 1>does that mean that he didn't write </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully?</v>

1552
01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1553
01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.560
<v Speaker 1>they're just some beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1554
01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love is not love which alters when it </v>

1555
01:06:10.361 --> 01:06:11.194
<v Speaker 1>alteration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finds or bends with the remover to </v>

1556
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:14.290
<v Speaker 1>remove it's old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so beautiful.</v>

1557
01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And you want the children to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>access this.</v>

1558
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.000
<v Speaker 1>and we teach them other poems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>invictus,</v>

1559
01:06:19.001 --> 01:06:19.834
<v Speaker 1>which means an unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one was one of mandela's favorite </v>

1560
01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:23.490
<v Speaker 1>poems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1561
01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:24.990
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>

1562
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.580
<v Speaker 1>they say at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the master of my fate.</v>

1563
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:28.503
<v Speaker 1>I am the captain of my soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of our kids put their hands on </v>

1564
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:32.680
<v Speaker 1>here when they say I am the master of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>fate.</v>

1565
01:06:32.681 --> 01:06:33.514
<v Speaker 1>And there's nearly 200 kids in the lunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole olis belting this out and loving </v>

1566
01:06:37.301 --> 01:06:39.280
<v Speaker 1>it because they are the masters of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fate.</v>

1567
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:40.323
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's teaching the kids that and </v>

1568
01:06:42.281 --> 01:06:44.710
<v Speaker 1>inspiring them to make a difference with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives.</v>

1569
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Whatever their color as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1570
01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:47.973
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's racism and sexism in the </v>

1571
01:06:49.061 --> 01:06:49.894
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore you're never going to be able </v>

1572
01:06:50.471 --> 01:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1573
01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:53.800
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just give up and don't worry because</v>

1574
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.420
<v Speaker 1>there's welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can always just,</v>

1575
01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:58.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just take the welfare instead of</v>

1576
01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.620
<v Speaker 1>instead of making something of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1577
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1578
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:02.463
<v Speaker 1>that is what it is to kill a man when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you kill his self determination and you </v>

1579
01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:06.394
<v Speaker 1>kill his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his agency and you kill his motivation </v>

1580
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:11.920
<v Speaker 1>to do something with his life that is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill a man.</v>

1581
01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>And that is what the left is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1582
01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:17.920
<v Speaker 1>and I say that's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is racism.</v>

1583
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we should say it out loud,</v>

1584
01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:21.423
<v Speaker 1>but we never do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conservatives never called it and </v>

1585
01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:25.660
<v Speaker 1>they should call it what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1586
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:28.370
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1587
01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.890
<v Speaker 1>what can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just gotta keep going,</v>

1588
01:07:29.891 --> 01:07:30.724
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1589
01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:34.420
<v Speaker 2>What a beautiful ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ending right there.</v>

1590
01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:35.493
<v Speaker 2>We're going to clip that one and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something with that because that was </v>

1591
01:07:36.851 --> 01:07:38.800
<v Speaker 2>just part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that this is what it's all about.</v>

1592
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.233
<v Speaker 2>Everything that I'm trying to do here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the roots and the </v>

1593
01:07:43.451 --> 01:07:44.284
<v Speaker 2>foundation of all of that and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it and I promise you I will make </v>

1594
01:07:46.781 --> 01:07:49.670
<v Speaker 2>it to the school when I'm in the uk for </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1595
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Can I do to give a little talk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can do something like.</v>

1596
