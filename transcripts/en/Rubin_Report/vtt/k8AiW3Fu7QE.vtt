1
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.903
<v Speaker 1>You guys know that I try my best to stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the day to day political </v>

2
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:08.934
<v Speaker 1>bickering and focus more on big ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the philosophies which are behind </v>

3
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:12.714
<v Speaker 1>all the fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean I'm ignoring the </v>

4
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.350
<v Speaker 1>issues of the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be it North Korea,</v>

5
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>the gun debate or the general state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trumpism,</v>

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.063
<v Speaker 1>but focusing on why people believe what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe is far more valuable to me </v>

7
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>than adding fuel to the fire of whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of the day might be.</v>

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.113
<v Speaker 1>Toss in a healthy dose of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>gridlock and we seem to have lots of </v>

9
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>people who were yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very few people who are doing.</v>

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>There's one issue happening in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics right now,</v>

11
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>which is a great example of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stagnation we face,</v>

12
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>but that is totally flying under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radar right now.</v>

13
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.234
<v Speaker 1>Dozens of countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them key strategic allies don't </v>

14
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:48.954
<v Speaker 1>have us ambassadors because the Senate </v>
<v Speaker 1>has refused to vote on their </v>

15
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>confirmation.</v>

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>According to the rules of the Senate </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

17
00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>the Senate needs 30 hours of debate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirm an ambassadorship.</v>

18
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine with all the nonsensical</v>
<v Speaker 1>waste in DC,</v>

19
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:04.554
<v Speaker 1>how impossible it would be to spend 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours debating each of the new </v>

20
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>ambassador ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a new administration comes in,</v>

21
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.903
<v Speaker 1>we'd be talking about literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of hours of debate for a </v>

22
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:14.994
<v Speaker 1>branch of government which can't seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>agree on which flavor of yogurt should </v>

23
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>be served at the capital hill </v>
<v Speaker 1>commissary.</v>

24
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Back in 2014 when the Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled the Senate,</v>

25
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:24.504
<v Speaker 1>then majority leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Reid used what is known as the </v>

26
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:27.774
<v Speaker 1>nuclear option to get many Obama </v>
<v Speaker 1>appointees through the Senate in effect </v>

27
00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:32.704
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change the rules so that a simple </v>

28
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:34.704
<v Speaker 1>majority rather than a 60 vote super </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority would be enough to confirm </v>

29
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>ambassadors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal judges,</v>

30
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:40.824
<v Speaker 1>and other positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though I was firmly on the left at the </v>

31
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:43.464
<v Speaker 1>time and I had no issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember with the Obama </v>

32
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:46.194
<v Speaker 1>appointees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was against read using such a drastic </v>

33
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>tactic.</v>

34
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.393
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you change the rules when you're in </v>

35
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:52.394
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly obvious and probably </v>

36
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 1>quite deserved when those same rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be used against your team.</v>

37
00:01:57.841 --> 00:01:58.674
<v Speaker 1>When you're not in power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can rightly blame Republicans for </v>

38
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>not voting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the Obama appointees in 2014,</v>

39
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:04.884
<v Speaker 1>just as right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can rightly blame Democrats for not </v>

40
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.643
<v Speaker 1>voting on trump appointees in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly why people rightfully </v>

41
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>hate the political machine in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>

42
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.923
<v Speaker 1>It either does nothing or it changes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules to suit itself while usually </v>

43
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:24.441
<v Speaker 1>leaving the people it's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve far behind the Republicans now led</v>

44
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:25.524
<v Speaker 1>by majority leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitch Mcconnell could use what is known </v>

45
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:33.261
<v Speaker 1>as the nuclear option right now just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Reid and the Democrats did back in 2014.</v>

46
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>McConnell refuses to do so.</v>

47
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.553
<v Speaker 1>Some were saying he has such an old </v>
<v Speaker 1>school affinity for the rules of the </v>

48
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Senate that he doesn't want to stoop to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what reed did in a certain way.</v>

49
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>This seems like a principled position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at this point in American politics,</v>

50
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:49.314
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if clinging onto the old ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>while your ideological opponents chisel </v>

51
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:58.401
<v Speaker 1>away at those very institutions at every</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity makes much sense at all.</v>

52
00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.573
<v Speaker 1>Let me add another wrinkle to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The highest ranking ambassadorship that </v>

53
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.034
<v Speaker 1>we now have open Germany has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>offered to former US spokesmen for the </v>

54
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>UN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Grenelle.</v>

55
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Richard is the longest serving UN </v>
<v Speaker 1>spokesman in history,</v>

56
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>working for four different US </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambassadors.</v>

57
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.133
<v Speaker 1>He's also served several other positions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the government as well as worked for </v>

58
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>a few other high level political </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns by every measure.</v>

59
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.824
<v Speaker 1>He's supremely qualified and I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty of people on both sides of the </v>

60
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:24.784
<v Speaker 1>aisle that praise him as the exact type </v>
<v Speaker 1>of person that we need more of in </v>

61
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:28.474
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard and I have become friends over </v>

62
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:30.964
<v Speaker 1>the past few years and I can personally </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you that he's truly a decent guy </v>

63
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>who just wants to serve his country.</v>

64
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's one other piece to this.</v>

65
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Richard happens to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may remember back in 2012,</v>

66
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:43.294
<v Speaker 1>Richard was briefly a spokesman for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romney campaign until the media decided </v>

67
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:51.721
<v Speaker 1>to attack an openly gay man for daring </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work for the Republican candidate,</v>

68
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Mitt Romney thus causing Richard to step</v>
<v Speaker 1>down from the campaign because he didn't</v>

69
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>want to be a distraction apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although Romney felt it was just fine to</v>

70
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:01.594
<v Speaker 1>hire a gay man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Richard felt it was totally okay to </v>

71
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:04.744
<v Speaker 1>work for Romney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The media just wouldn't let it be gay </v>

72
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>conservatives like Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like black conservatives like Larry</v>

73
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>elder or female conservatives like Nikki</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haley,</v>

74
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.333
<v Speaker 1>challenge the orthodoxy that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats must own all of these groups </v>

75
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:19.984
<v Speaker 1>of people I mentioned Richard Sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because it's important or even </v>

76
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:24.064
<v Speaker 1>relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you play the identity politics </v>

77
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>game as so many do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In effect,</v>

78
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:28.894
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats are blocking and extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualified openly gay men from serving </v>

79
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>his country aren't the Democrats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>left these supposed to be for gays.</v>

80
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that part of their intersectional </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview?</v>

81
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Immutable characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often trump qualifications.</v>

82
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>If you subscribe to this line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

83
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.833
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This also means supporting gay people </v>

84
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:49.174
<v Speaker 1>whose political positions you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with because you believe in </v>

85
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:53.134
<v Speaker 1>their ability to think for themselves or</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the so called tolerance side </v>

86
00:04:56.651 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 1>really isn't pro gay or pro any </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority.</v>

87
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:05.041
<v Speaker 1>They are actually only pro those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe as they do now,</v>

88
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.943
<v Speaker 1>obviously you know that I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone should be confirmed because of </v>

89
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>their sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor should their sexuality matter in the</v>

90
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>least when it comes to being nominated </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>

91
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>I just think that this particular cases </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting on so many levels.</v>

92
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.103
<v Speaker 1>We have the gridlock of Washington with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats refusing to vote on trump </v>

93
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>nominees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a majority leader,</v>

94
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.273
<v Speaker 1>Mcconnell that refuses to use his option</v>
<v Speaker 1>to confirm nominees even though the </v>

95
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>previous Senate leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reid did exactly just that.</v>

96
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.993
<v Speaker 1>We have dozens of qualified candidates </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting to do their civic duty and we </v>

97
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>have just as many countries waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>our ambassadors to move there and get to</v>

98
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>work cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this mess is a good man,</v>

99
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.384
<v Speaker 1>Richard Grinnell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I happen to know personally who </v>

100
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want extra credit for being gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just wants to get to work.</v>

101
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>How can you make a difference in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

102
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Call your local senator and ask their </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant at the office</v>

103
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 2>why they are in voting on these nominees</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can also call Mitch Mcconnell at</v>

104
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 2>his DC office by calling two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

105
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

106
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.381
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

107
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:07.101
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

108
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:07.934
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

109
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give him a call right now.</v>

110
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Joining me today as a guy who seen an </v>
<v Speaker 2>awful lot of people get hit in the nuts,</v>

111
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.153
<v Speaker 2>a man who's lived in a house that </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly seems to be getting fuller </v>

112
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:23.714
<v Speaker 2>and a standup comic who's new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Special zero to 60 is now streaming on </v>

113
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob Saget,</v>

114
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 2>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

115
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a very smart man.</v>

116
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:33.494
<v Speaker 2>I cannot keep up with you mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we did have dinner and I seem to </v>

117
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 2>keep up with the entrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that why you were applying me with so</v>

118
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 2>much alcohol during dinner to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb me down,</v>

119
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 2>so I just said that we could get on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

120
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see what you were like </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>

121
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did go because that's the world we're</v>

122
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 2>in right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

124
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Opposite day kind of statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

125
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 2>years ago when you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what your unconscious.</v>

126
00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.443
<v Speaker 2>That would be a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately we are in a world </v>

127
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 2>right now where that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

128
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.020
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of things that are a reverend </v>
<v Speaker 2>and could be considered funny or not.</v>

129
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this buffering that goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>on before,</v>

130
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:15.314
<v Speaker 2>but either way you did not get overly </v>
<v Speaker 2>inebriated and you were more than </v>

131
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.184
<v Speaker 2>pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had a lovely night with both of </v>

132
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:26.510
<v Speaker 2>our significant others who we both adore</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we laughed and we had good food.</v>

133
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will do it again.</v>

134
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 2>We will do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's all I want to talk about.</v>

135
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Talking about my career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we have his entree,</v>

136
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

137
00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I had the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did.</v>

138
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I think you had something not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>

139
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you had some kind of chicken.</v>

140
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:42.420
<v Speaker 2>So I'm to maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

141
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.420
<v Speaker 2>let's focus here and say I get.</v>

142
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 2>So I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good place to start.</v>

143
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 2>What you just did there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the state of political correctness.</v>

144
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Let's just do a little bit on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I want to do saget one-on-one.</v>

145
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For this next hour,</v>

146
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm teaching that course at a community </v>
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>

147
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 2>How many kids are taking it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

148
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Whoever applies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't turn me in.</v>

149
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm all in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody comes in to the trailer.</v>

150
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of a that you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

151
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:11.261
<v Speaker 2>We're live to tape so we don't edit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this did not exist four years ago.</v>

152
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 2>This existed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't exist like this.</v>

153
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got millions of people that watch</v>

154
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:16.514
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

156
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:20.360
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're used to doing.</v>

157
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously I went to stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else,</v>

158
00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:23.740
<v Speaker 2>but you do scripted series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys,</v>

159
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 2>you do movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that,</v>

160
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 2>but you also do you do panel on talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

161
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 2>things that are sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of old school now.</v>

162
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Like that's very different than coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>in here and right before we start I said</v>

163
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to go for it.</v>

164
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 2>And you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want.</v>

165
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to look.</v>

166
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I can just do that and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

167
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.350
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Well you get a little bit back again and</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

169
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Those are the smallest cards I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen your interviews on.</v>

170
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Microfiche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

171
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I just write little silly things or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

172
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 2>that looks all smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

173
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that this exists because</v>

174
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to go on a show and have a</v>

175
00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 2>one on one with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

176
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.013
<v Speaker 2>you were a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was Tom Snyder and we'd be </v>

177
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.600
<v Speaker 2>getting that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

178
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 2>that you might be tiny bit older than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

179
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:08.893
<v Speaker 2>The camera was always very close to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is incredibly close and Dan Akroyd on </v>

180
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:12.654
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night live and the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning we do an impression of it was </v>

181
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:15.864
<v Speaker 2>this tight and he would be smoking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom and just talking to camera do is </v>

182
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 2>discourse which is very much like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast is today.</v>

183
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Like bill burr friend of mine gets up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning,</v>

184
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.763
<v Speaker 2>talks for an hour once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable to listen to a lot of </v>

185
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 2>our great podcasters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

186
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 2>everything has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that regard,</v>

187
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.213
<v Speaker 2>this has changed for the better because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to have an articulate </v>

188
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

189
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 2>that you can't normally have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial television because commercial</v>

190
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 2>televisions meant to be entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

191
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Only I don't know what we're meant to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>over here.</v>

192
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

193
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

194
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my fiance,</v>

195
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Kelly turned me onto your show and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I really like him and I like what</v>

196
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:01.164
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you had guests on and you wherever </v>

197
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 2>you're able to be a diplomat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

198
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:06.024
<v Speaker 2>which is very difficult to do when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have people with different points of </v>

199
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A conservative and a liberal,</v>

200
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 2>which I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand any of it.</v>

201
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean I understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean we're mammals,</v>

202
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.133
<v Speaker 2>whereas opposed to alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to be nice to another </v>

203
00:10:24.721 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 2>mammal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose to hunt it and kill it depends</v>

204
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:29.034
<v Speaker 2>which kind of mammal you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's delicious then you have to go </v>

205
00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:33.880
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

206
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.873
<v Speaker 2>Just food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we're gonna we're gonna dive into </v>

207
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:36.924
<v Speaker 2>all that because I did notice that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you it's interesting I think because </v>

208
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.763
<v Speaker 2>your standup is so different than your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your television persona between </v>

209
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Americans money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the video is in full as well that the</v>

210
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:50.220
<v Speaker 2>old ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then entourage that was Kinda like a</v>

211
00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:51.054
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then.</v>

212
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.310
<v Speaker 2>But then I did a bunch of acting stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

213
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:55.410
<v Speaker 2>And I've done Broadway work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

214
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.423
<v Speaker 2>some of it was similar to my standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've always done some mean that's </v>

215
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.730
<v Speaker 2>every seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some new incarnation that people</v>

216
00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the hell is he?</v>

217
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's why I think it's interesting</v>

218
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:06.324
<v Speaker 2>because especially with celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like to just get an or anyone </v>

219
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:13.440
<v Speaker 2>that's public that they like to just get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of image of you and then just run</v>

220
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:14.274
<v Speaker 2>with that forever and challenging that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I refuse to be pigeonholed because it </v>

221
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 2>sounds like something you should not do </v>
<v Speaker 2>to little pigeon now.</v>

222
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 2>See that's the kind of joke you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>still do.</v>

223
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.210
<v Speaker 2>You still do that because it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being.</v>

224
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a pigeon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the only people that are going to be</v>

225
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 2>really upset about that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>humane society and they are right.</v>

226
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.170
<v Speaker 2>They spcas all over the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just.</v>

227
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't see their name anywhere anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're out.</v>

228
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 2>You think they're done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

229
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.240
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the Aas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>PCA,</v>

230
00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:49.080
<v Speaker 2>NRA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a combined so that you take</v>

231
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:50.790
<v Speaker 2>care of the bird and then you fire at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

232
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.743
<v Speaker 2>Is that going to fly well on this show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it will know we've got those </v>

233
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 2>chickens out there in one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People always ask me,</v>

234
00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:58.720
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do when they stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>laying eggs or you just wait a minute,</v>

235
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.463
<v Speaker 2>but they're so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought they were males because they </v>

236
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:06.670
<v Speaker 2>had the red millet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millay millay was to call you.</v>

237
00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 2>We're very excited to say Kako.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said you have three beautiful Cox,</v>

238
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are actually.</v>

239
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Those are female hens that lay eggs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing this for?</v>

240
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:17.620
<v Speaker 2>The eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just as woody Allen,</v>

241
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 2>which was Groucho Marx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need the eggs and the eggs,</v>

242
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 2>but that's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy Hall.</v>

243
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

244
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a problem with me as a talk show</v>

245
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:30.640
<v Speaker 2>guest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a comedian.</v>

246
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as someone without a script,</v>

247
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I free associate and I sometimes do not </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay on track,</v>

248
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 2>but you were so smart and linear.</v>

249
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.583
<v Speaker 2>You were going to keep me on track and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>will do my very best to accommodate you </v>

250
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.790
<v Speaker 2>and I will do my best to accommodate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>

251
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fair.</v>

252
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Let's start at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were born in Philadelphia?</v>

253
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

254
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 2>in Einstein Hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Einstein hospital.</v>

255
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.500
<v Speaker 2>And it's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that an honor of Albert Einstein?</v>

256
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

257
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.133
<v Speaker 2>And it's on broad street and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was born there and my dad worked </v>

258
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:09.340
<v Speaker 2>for a supermarket company called Food </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pantry,</v>

259
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 2>pride supermarkets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was an executive.</v>

260
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.070
<v Speaker 2>That all sounds legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about your family?</v>

261
00:13:17.071 --> 00:13:18.190
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what background?</v>

262
00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 2>What business were they in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born in Brooklyn,</v>

263
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 2>grew up in Long Island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived in Manhattan my whole life.</v>

264
00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upstate New York.</v>

265
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a true New Yorker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're both.</v>

266
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 2>You had the life I wish I had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Philly.</v>

267
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:31.390
<v Speaker 2>I lived at home during college.</v>

268
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.223
<v Speaker 2>You had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had.</v>

269
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.123
<v Speaker 2>This is why you are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go out and tell a bunch of wiener </v>

270
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:36.371
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

271
00:13:36.371 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going back into that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>

272
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out doing stand up.</v>

273
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I told you I'm going back into standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were very excited.</v>

274
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.683
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also told me you were playing the </v>

275
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Irvine Improv and when is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

276
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.600
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't even public just now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

277
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.493
<v Speaker 2>Is that okay to say that April eighth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>April my first headlining Gig in 10 </v>

278
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:54.094
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is one of the nicest clubs in </v>

279
00:13:56.321 --> 00:13:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

280
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.720
<v Speaker 2>in anywhere really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

281
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like 600 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>700 people.</v>

282
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:02.884
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a Disney exhibit and it's </v>

283
00:14:05.141 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an irvine,</v>

284
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 2>which is why they call it the Irvine </v>
<v Speaker 2>Improv and couldn't put that together.</v>

285
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Why do they call it the Irvine Improv </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's spit,</v>

286
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're smart people and uh,</v>

287
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.650
<v Speaker 2>and then nice people.</v>

288
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you will bring some more people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have so many people that you</v>

289
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:22.990
<v Speaker 2>will bring your audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

290
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.570
<v Speaker 2>that's the advantage of what we do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we do,</v>

291
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 2>whatever media we're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's who comes to see us.</v>

292
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be the most beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift in comedy.</v>

293
00:14:31.361 --> 00:14:32.194
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that moment when you </v>

294
00:14:32.921 --> 00:14:33.754
<v Speaker 2>went from being a guy that was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get on eight out of 10 comics </v>

295
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:39.250
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the night?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows who you are.</v>

296
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the beginning of when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were going,</v>

297
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to see Bob Saget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something weird happened with me,</v>

298
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.820
<v Speaker 2>which was I started doing standup when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was 17 and I want to hear that.</v>

299
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>That was a re heal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>73.</v>

301
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because I'm 104 on the freeway.</v>

302
00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Head of hair though for $100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Bad.</v>

303
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very impressed.</v>

304
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Speaker 2>But I had to do the drops.</v>

305
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.873
<v Speaker 2>I take the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take propecia that's supposed to take </v>

306
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 2>on the probation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seems fine.</v>

307
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't compare me to that.</v>

308
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.580
<v Speaker 2>That's the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get there.</v>

309
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Speaker 2>We'll get my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a comb over.</v>

310
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.180
<v Speaker 2>I know it's going to happen if we get </v>
<v Speaker 2>right on trump.</v>

311
00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

312
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

313
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing.</v>

314
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:22.723
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing anything to bash anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not do it even though it's </v>

315
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:26.834
<v Speaker 2>possible that his comb-over is from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>onion in the kitchen that just snaggle </v>

316
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:34.100
<v Speaker 2>tooth along the ground and then crawls </v>
<v Speaker 2>up his back.</v>

317
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that moment when I saw that </v>
<v Speaker 2>video on the airplane that done CGI?</v>

318
00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Was that done with effects because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't look possible?</v>

319
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.730
<v Speaker 2>It looks pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked pretty fake.</v>

320
00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:45.830
<v Speaker 2>But let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put trump aside.</v>

321
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.230
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

322
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that moment when,</v>

323
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:50.030
<v Speaker 2>when things change?</v>

324
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was I came out to la.</v>

325
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I went on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one,</v>

326
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:54.284
<v Speaker 2>the Student Academy Award for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary I made about my nephew who </v>

327
00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:59.540
<v Speaker 2>had his face reconstructed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

328
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:03.560
<v Speaker 2>when he was seven and I won this student</v>
<v Speaker 2>Academy Award for documentary and then I</v>

329
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:04.394
<v Speaker 2>went on at the comedy store the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and Mitzi the owner of the comedy </v>

330
00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you should work here.</v>

331
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 2>So I started getting spots right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

332
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 2>And then I started a fight for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People fight and I didn't work the door.</v>

333
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

334
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess the likable but strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strange jokes.</v>

335
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Like my first joke was I have the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

336
00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.493
<v Speaker 2>I have the brain of a German shepherd </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the body of a 16 year old boy and </v>

337
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:31.330
<v Speaker 2>they're both in my car and I want you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see them now.</v>

338
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.730
<v Speaker 2>It's just an odd rambling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it symbolizes,</v>

339
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.733
<v Speaker 2>I think it answers the question of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>did he become this because he was that </v>

340
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be third person.</v>

341
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

342
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 2>and then I started going on a college </v>
<v Speaker 2>tour.</v>

343
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.790
<v Speaker 2>She put me on a Mitzi shore for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store,</v>

344
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:50.624
<v Speaker 2>put me on a college tour and I was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guitar act just to parodies and I would </v>

345
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:58.820
<v Speaker 2>sing while my guitar gently weeps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn a valve and water poured out of the</v>

346
00:16:58.821 --> 00:17:01.970
<v Speaker 2>guitar and you could only see it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first 10 rows.</v>

347
00:17:01.971 --> 00:17:04.690
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't really work for the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>stadium.</v>

348
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.710
<v Speaker 2>CanNot play the Irvine Improv with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

349
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I was headlining right away.</v>

350
00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:10.724
<v Speaker 2>So in my early twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go out on the road while I was </v>

351
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:14.834
<v Speaker 2>taking five years of acting classes with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a teacher named Darryl Hickman and La </v>

352
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.183
<v Speaker 2>while I was doing improv classes at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>groundlings while I was doing spots at </v>

353
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.250
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go out on the road and then headline</v>

354
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:26.180
<v Speaker 2>and then make money.</v>

355
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not enough to get a career.</v>

356
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.893
<v Speaker 2>And then it was like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine years of hosting the comedy store </v>

357
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.330
<v Speaker 2>in Westwood and that was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

358
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.340
<v Speaker 2>but I got to be friend people that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>worshiped,</v>

359
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:41.174
<v Speaker 2>which were Richard Pryor and Robin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Williams and David Letterman was one of </v>

360
00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:44.774
<v Speaker 2>my first emcees and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I was 22 years old and the place </v>

361
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:53.220
<v Speaker 2>was packed like it was then kind of now </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad sentence.</v>

362
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:54.054
<v Speaker 2>But in the early eighties it was you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could not get into any room and every </v>

363
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 2>single person on the lineup was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was hosting a lot of the shows,</v>

364
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.080
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

365
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:06.923
<v Speaker 2>but then everybody went off and got tv </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows and I was still at the comedy </v>

366
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:12.540
<v Speaker 2>store hosting and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>

367
00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I got an,</v>

368
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:20.211
<v Speaker 2>a Richard Pryor movie and then I got on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a cbs show and a morning show or movie a</v>

369
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 2>critical condition.</v>

370
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that on the young Dr Jaffe who</v>

371
00:18:24.421 --> 00:18:25.254
<v Speaker 2>does all the jobs that are disgusting </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he doesn't want to do because he's </v>

372
00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:28.734
<v Speaker 2>not a real doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like the emcee at a comedy </v>

373
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:32.200
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the same thing,</v>

374
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.413
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to touch people and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember holding Garrett Morris from </v>

375
00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night live by the testicles and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard kept calling me,</v>

376
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.240
<v Speaker 2>kept telling me to squeeze harder and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a reshoot.</v>

377
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.123
<v Speaker 2>They added me to that scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see them when you talk about it </v>

378
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've had this with a couple of other</v>

379
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:54.030
<v Speaker 2>comics that were around at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a real nostalgia for it.</v>

380
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember thinking it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>special that was yet,</v>

381
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.100
<v Speaker 2>but you remember it at the time thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

382
00:18:59.101 --> 00:18:59.934
<v Speaker 2>I'm really in 100 percent because </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually people don't like the good old </v>

383
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:04.080
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only remember them as well.</v>

384
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.890
<v Speaker 2>They weren't good old days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

385
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.550
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

386
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.130
<v Speaker 2>you're in a place that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

387
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:10.973
<v Speaker 2>in the comedy stars a lot of history and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it Ciro's is the main room and there's </v>

388
00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:14.604
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be ghosts in there and Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennison says Esau quarter floating in </v>

389
00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:21.390
<v Speaker 2>the air of a dead mobster or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I believe all of it.</v>

390
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time in there,</v>

391
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was struggling,</v>

392
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have people come and see you.</v>

393
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Rodney dangerfield was kind to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put me on a young comedian special,</v>

394
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 2>but it was all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

395
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:39.890
<v Speaker 2>what I was the warmup comic for Bosom </v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddies with Tom Hanks and Gary and um,</v>

396
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.940
<v Speaker 2>it was all struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

397
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.140
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need it.</v>

398
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.483
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I used to wait in line in New York </v>

399
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.280
<v Speaker 2>at him at the Improv and catch a rising </v>
<v Speaker 2>star for 10 hours a sign.</v>

400
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 2>The lineup sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll wait for 10,</v>

401
00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:52.674
<v Speaker 2>12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's something if you </v>

402
00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:55.674
<v Speaker 2>come out of the Dugout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really are the trenches are dug </v>

403
00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:01.010
<v Speaker 2>outs fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna,</v>

404
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.740
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>

405
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.810
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna bat maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

406
00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:04.644
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you come out of the trenches and </v>

407
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.340
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go through it,</v>

408
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 2>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

409
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.150
<v Speaker 2>guy had a heart attack of the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had that happen before,</v>

410
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

411
00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:14.540
<v Speaker 2>this guy's getting thrown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

412
00:20:14.541 --> 00:20:16.460
<v Speaker 2>this guy's got a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

413
00:20:16.461 --> 00:20:17.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happened to me in Cleveland.</v>

414
00:20:17.671 --> 00:20:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets to the point where you're almost</v>

415
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:23.790
<v Speaker 2>a pilot on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

416
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:25.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready for anything,</v>

417
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.960
<v Speaker 2>but when you want to do is make people </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>

418
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.093
<v Speaker 2>And that was the hardest transition for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me was to take off the guitar and to </v>

419
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 2>learn to be a comedian.</v>

420
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.090
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I.</v>

421
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.020
<v Speaker 2>What was that moment like for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really hard.</v>

422
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a guitar on for like four years.</v>

423
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I took it off and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bombed for a long time.</v>

424
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.120
<v Speaker 2>I would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used the club for what it was supposed</v>

425
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 2>to be used for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't surprise me.</v>

426
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:57.270
<v Speaker 2>It didn't help me get a sitcom if people</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw me and they went,</v>

427
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.870
<v Speaker 2>he's amicable but he's not funny and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was trying to do jokes and a lot of them</v>

428
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:02.704
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a talent coordinator for the </v>

429
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:06.850
<v Speaker 2>tonight show I could never get on as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comic.</v>

430
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:07.923
<v Speaker 2>I got on to do panel with Johnny Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to Gary Shandling for putting me </v>

431
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:13.510
<v Speaker 2>on the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Jay Leno,</v>

432
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.710
<v Speaker 2>I was on once with him but that I was on</v>
<v Speaker 2>with carson 13,</v>

433
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 2>14 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in and always panel,</v>

434
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:22.683
<v Speaker 2>but I never went on as a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this talent coordinator who </v>

435
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 2>passed on named Jim Mccauley who helped </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people's careers,</v>

436
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except mind.</v>

437
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.460
<v Speaker 2>But he did help me in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said you're very funny,</v>

438
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 2>but your act is like a stone skipping on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water.</v>

439
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:41.690
<v Speaker 2>It never really digs in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

440
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

441
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:46.220
<v Speaker 2>That's something to really take Kung Fu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

442
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:46.961
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Master.</v>

443
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Take the pebble from my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

444
00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.450
<v Speaker 2>it hurt me because I couldn't get on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn show,</v>

445
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.550
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wasn't meant to.</v>

446
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say those kinds of words,</v>

447
00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not meant to be or whatever,</v>

448
00:21:59.231 --> 00:22:04.120
<v Speaker 2>but it was hell of a lot better to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and todd,</v>

449
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:09.150
<v Speaker 2>a couple of segments with Johnny Carson </v>
<v Speaker 2>and him like me and be able to talk to a</v>

450
00:22:10.511 --> 00:22:11.344
<v Speaker 2>guy that you looked up to so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was kind of a master like </v>

451
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:16.630
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm emanating true jealousy.</v>

452
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I hear any of you guys talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Carson,</v>

453
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:20.430
<v Speaker 2>it's like that.</v>

454
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.070
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not even making this up because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not delusional.</v>

455
00:22:24.071 --> 00:22:26.620
<v Speaker 2>He liked me and I still can't figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out.</v>

456
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.900
<v Speaker 2>But I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say something like,</v>

457
00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:32.530
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Letterman had a lot of his amazing</v>

458
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.423
<v Speaker 2>qualities and it would respond the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to this because one of my patterns </v>

459
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:39.670
<v Speaker 2>that I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is true.</v>

460
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.950
<v Speaker 2>And Johnny would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

461
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.733
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just tell it wouldn't be the same thing </v>

462
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.080
<v Speaker 2>would go on letterman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would go,</v>

463
00:22:50.081 --> 00:22:51.010
<v Speaker 2>this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

464
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if it's true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just make it funny.</v>

465
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.573
<v Speaker 2>Just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm blanking on the title of Bill </v>

466
00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Maher's first book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the novel that he wrote about standup.</v>

467
00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the first line in it,</v>

468
00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:01.624
<v Speaker 2>he says something about this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what a comic says when </v>

469
00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:05.740
<v Speaker 2>they were about to tell you something </v>
<v Speaker 2>false.</v>

470
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how that,</v>

471
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.500
<v Speaker 2>that's how the novel the Hell is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>name of the book.</v>

472
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I'll get it in a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should know I should.</v>

473
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.960
<v Speaker 2>This guy should I know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a picture,</v>

474
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:14.803
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are deleted in reading each other's </v>

475
00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:18.820
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a red mine.</v>

476
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True story is the name of the book.</v>

477
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true story.</v>

478
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 2>That's a bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also think about this,</v>

479
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but seriously folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the segue into your next job,</v>

480
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.050
<v Speaker 2>our bob hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you.</v>

481
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.440
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always good.</v>

482
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.870
<v Speaker 2>But these are all the same anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm in the car.</v>

483
00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:43.960
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do learn tricks and it's always,</v>

484
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:44.794
<v Speaker 2>if you can kill them with kindness or if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fake sincerity with air guys </v>

485
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:50.090
<v Speaker 2>during that because everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone talks about.</v>

486
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:50.924
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could literally spend the next hour </v>

487
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:53.410
<v Speaker 2>with you just naming all stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

488
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.253
<v Speaker 2>You can just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But were there guys drop name drop for </v>

489
00:23:57.891 --> 00:23:59.440
<v Speaker 2>the next and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be very easy to make a promo.</v>

490
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.070
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor Irwin Corey.</v>

491
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.720
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one will know that.</v>

492
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Well I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

493
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.753
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but were there guys that you thought </v>

494
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:08.240
<v Speaker 2>were true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Hicks transcendent?</v>

495
00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it of like Bill Hicks,</v>

496
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.580
<v Speaker 2>that's transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

497
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.140
<v Speaker 2>that's the guy who a worship Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennison,</v>

498
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.930
<v Speaker 2>who was a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got Ms.</v>

499
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I got Sam is for a spot at the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>

500
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Was it in the documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

501
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:24.880
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

502
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.020
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an unusual thing.</v>

503
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:28.460
<v Speaker 2>It was an anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

504
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.253
<v Speaker 2>no one had ever seen that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Bill Hicks really thought about why </v>

505
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:36.890
<v Speaker 2>are we here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

506
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.770
<v Speaker 2>had a sweet philosopher in him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

507
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gentle George Carlin kind of thing.</v>

508
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.280
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

509
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 2>from a gentler version I did because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew him,</v>

510
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.710
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and he was kind of,</v>

511
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.573
<v Speaker 2>I knew him when he was really young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met him when he was like 18 or </v>

512
00:24:57.801 --> 00:25:02.070
<v Speaker 2>something or 19 and he hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of took to me and,</v>

513
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:07.140
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his loss was very sad.</v>

514
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 2>It would have loved to have seen what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have arrived at.</v>

515
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he'd been,</v>

516
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:13.960
<v Speaker 2>he died very young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

517
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.830
<v Speaker 2>that's the type of conduct we need more </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

518
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially now like thoughtful,</v>

519
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:22.490
<v Speaker 2>but guys that are really saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like being,</v>

520
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting back in,</v>

521
00:25:24.171 --> 00:25:25.310
<v Speaker 2>so maybe I'll find them all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

522
00:25:25.311 --> 00:25:27.500
<v Speaker 2>you can't help but reckoned with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle.</v>

523
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean the demand is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

524
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:35.170
<v Speaker 2>he's also arguably the best living stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and remind you of Richard was at that</v>

525
00:25:36.651 --> 00:25:39.980
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best living standup might be still.</v>

526
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.353
<v Speaker 2>I'm lenny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bruce was decomposed by being arrested </v>

527
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.690
<v Speaker 2>by not being allowed to have freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

528
00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:50.300
<v Speaker 2>George Carlin took it to another level </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he said,</v>

529
00:25:50.301 --> 00:25:51.134
<v Speaker 2>I'm cutting my hair no more and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to let myself say the things that </v>

530
00:25:56.751 --> 00:26:00.500
<v Speaker 2>are on my mind and was a lot of anger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of prophecy and people.</v>

531
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.840
<v Speaker 2>My Mother didn't like him because he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>unkempt.</v>

532
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wanted to kempt person.</v>

533
00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.620
<v Speaker 2>She would have loved you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

534
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if every camp I'm very.</v>

535
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of hairspray and she wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's so smart and he's handsome.</v>

536
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Outright Zagat enough to tell you what </v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother would say.</v>

537
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Carlin having that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like you putting down the guitar.</v>

538
00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think it's.</v>

539
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it's interesting when either get</v>
<v Speaker 2>good or not.</v>

540
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:23.234
<v Speaker 2>It's when you make that move you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like learn something and then you </v>

541
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 2>kind of start all over again because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the,</v>

542
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.533
<v Speaker 2>you get some chops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you figure out what it's like to be in </v>

543
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:32.144
<v Speaker 2>front of people.</v>

544
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's not an effort.</v>

545
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

546
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

547
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be 62 in May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy.</v>

548
00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 2>So if you could delay this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be great.</v>

549
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.443
<v Speaker 2>It's not letting that happen yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm able to go on stage and I had a </v>

550
00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:57.420
<v Speaker 2>gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now having a special just done that.</v>

551
00:26:57.421 --> 00:26:59.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm very proud of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero to 60,</v>

552
00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:04.730
<v Speaker 2>which is from zero to being 60th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant title wordy.</v>

553
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's on Amazon prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my joke is he was a joke with it.</v>

554
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.373
<v Speaker 2>With two clicks you can buy the lotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>to watch the special inferring that </v>

555
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.380
<v Speaker 2>that's how aroused you'll get watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>my special can,</v>

556
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:18.223

557
00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:22.050
<v Speaker 2>and then I think you deleted the tweet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

558
00:27:22.051 --> 00:27:22.861
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened here?</v>

559
00:27:22.861 --> 00:27:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Did you make a mistake in your tweet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

560
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 2>I made a mistake in my tweet and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

561
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:30.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we do it again.</v>

562
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Let's see how the rest of this goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

563
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.990
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand if you don't want to.</v>

564
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.390
<v Speaker 2>So let's not get ahead of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show myself out.</v>

565
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

566
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

567
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:40.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

568
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I put something wrong on there because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

569
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.940
<v Speaker 2>it's on many mediums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

570
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.450
<v Speaker 2>it's not a Netflix special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's on every platform.</v>

571
00:27:48.451 --> 00:27:51.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's on a spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>DIRECTV,</v>

572
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.283
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's never been done like this till </v>

573
00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:55.950
<v Speaker 2>now where they put it on every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on demand.</v>

574
00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:59.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you can choose between </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder woman or zero to 60.</v>

575
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me think.</v>

576
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I'd much rather watch Bob than wonder </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

577
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.750
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty cool though that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

578
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.860
<v Speaker 2>We all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the old days,</v>

579
00:28:07.861 --> 00:28:09.870
<v Speaker 2>everyone just wanted the HBO special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

580
00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I remember the day I started standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

581
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.000
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have an hbs.</v>

582
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I wanted one of my God.</v>

583
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Now you can have all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

584
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.830
<v Speaker 2>There's many different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

585
00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:22.410
<v Speaker 2>and Netflix is kind of the jewel in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crown.</v>

586
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:26.130
<v Speaker 2>So it was hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they mostly have a few new people,</v>

587
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:31.190
<v Speaker 2>but mostly they're regular team members </v>
<v Speaker 2>know bill or George Lopez of course,</v>

588
00:28:31.531 --> 00:28:34.080
<v Speaker 2>who is just wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like George.</v>

589
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:38.040
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has been a really cool model.</v>

590
00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm being on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prime is actually in the world,</v>

591
00:28:41.311 --> 00:28:42.144
<v Speaker 2>has it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted it to be seen by as many </v>

592
00:28:44.671 --> 00:28:46.590
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I stumbled about this thing.</v>

593
00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Let's just get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

594
00:28:48.431 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 2>this is seen by everybody I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

595
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:52.913
<v Speaker 2>As long as youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get to the feed and Youtube and </v>

596
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:57.480
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every person that subscribes,</v>

597
00:28:57.481 --> 00:28:59.050
<v Speaker 2>you make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

598
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.130
<v Speaker 2>You do make money is they roll ads on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

599
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:04.500
<v Speaker 2>We make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you made a roll ads on this.</v>

600
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.393
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what we talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say you may be deemed too controversial </v>

601
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.070
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not controversial on fuller house.</v>

602
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.700
<v Speaker 2>That's on Netflix is a very family </v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented show.</v>

603
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.893
<v Speaker 2>What do you need to sell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What product but help you make money on </v>

604
00:29:18.241 --> 00:29:20.280
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you know,</v>

605
00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:21.870
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want to lay in before </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

606
00:29:21.871 --> 00:29:23.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what they put in before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the funny thing.</v>

607
00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 2>No one associates the ad with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>content,</v>

608
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they just want me not to say anything</v>

609
00:29:28.621 --> 00:29:32.000
<v Speaker 2>offensive so that the advertiser won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

610
00:29:32.001 --> 00:29:34.410
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say I get talked about whatever,</v>

611
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.610
<v Speaker 2>like a fabric softener because any one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those sheets,</v>

612
00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:40.770
<v Speaker 2>that's like a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love that fabric.</v>

613
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I like fabric soft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great stuff.</v>

614
00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:43.973
<v Speaker 2>We did in and said to me what a bounce </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have on your jacket when it was </v>

615
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:48.043
<v Speaker 2>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect outfit and we compliment each </v>

616
00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:50.440
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

617
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I feel good about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>

618
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.070
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're crushing.</v>

619
00:29:54.071 --> 00:29:57.370
<v Speaker 2>This is full house thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit it.</v>

620
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Had not heard of it until I did a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>research for this.</v>

621
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it was a big sitcom.</v>

622
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Yes it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was for eight years and I didn't know</v>

623
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:06.364
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just knew I had a place to go to work </v>

624
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.720
<v Speaker 2>and that I would paid for kids private </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

625
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 2>So I told you this when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we had dinner a couple weeks ago,</v>

626
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:15.640
<v Speaker 2>but my sister was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's nine years younger than me.</v>

627
00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 2>She was so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know you hear this all the time,</v>

628
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:18.904
<v Speaker 2>but she was so obsessed with that show </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we were never allowed to watch TV </v>

629
00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:23.231
<v Speaker 2>at dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My family,</v>

630
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:25.010
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would sit and,</v>

631
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.300
<v Speaker 2>and have a good time or a bad time or </v>
<v Speaker 2>argue or laughed or whatever,</v>

632
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.463
<v Speaker 2>but my sister at some point took control</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the family and suddenly full house </v>

633
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.160
<v Speaker 2>was being watched during dinner.</v>

634
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She loves stamos.</v>

635
00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Everyone loves statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

636
00:30:40.961 --> 00:30:42.140
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone loves statement.</v>

637
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.230
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me a little bit about getting in on</v>

638
00:30:44.231 --> 00:30:45.064
<v Speaker 2>that and how that differed from standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then suddenly even though you had </v>

639
00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:48.124
<v Speaker 2>studied acting and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just like doing something that was </v>

640
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:51.280
<v Speaker 2>so different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Completely different.</v>

641
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd always wanted to be on a sitcom.</v>

642
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I'd been around them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

643
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

644
00:30:57.461 --> 00:31:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I was a warmup bosom buddies or go visit</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robin doing mork and Mindy.</v>

645
00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I would sneak into happy days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I snuck into the Bob Newhart show.</v>

646
00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I was under age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had to be 16 or 17.</v>

647
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I snuck into Mary Tyler Moore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would watch them filming these shows.</v>

648
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 2>James l Dot Brooks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

649
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.260
<v Speaker 2>producing Mary Tyler Moore show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>

650
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:18.094
<v Speaker 2>And I saw Bob Newhart last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had the name drop once to know when we </v>

651
00:31:20.591 --> 00:31:24.480
<v Speaker 2>can go to dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't mention you as don rickles,</v>

652
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:25.323
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a direct lift of the kind of </v>

653
00:31:27.881 --> 00:31:28.660
<v Speaker 2>thing he would say.</v>

654
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's perfection that really is kind of</v>

655
00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:31.563
<v Speaker 2>very professional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would say something like somebody </v>

656
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:34.870
<v Speaker 2>very famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

657
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:37.510
<v Speaker 2>I saw someone last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>

658
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I saw Chris rock last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't mention to you,</v>

659
00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.353
<v Speaker 2>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could make it now just because of </v>

660
00:31:43.451 --> 00:31:46.170
<v Speaker 2>the way we are about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was making it in an,</v>

661
00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.340
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a new young comedian.</v>

662
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

663
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.970
<v Speaker 2>but there's a new way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a way of love.</v>

664
00:31:57.521 --> 00:32:01.360
<v Speaker 2>And some people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people will make fun of everyone.</v>

665
00:32:01.361 --> 00:32:04.030
<v Speaker 2>My friend Jeff Ross is the postmaster </v>
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>

666
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

667
00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:09.250
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to bash people,</v>

668
00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:12.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's turned mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happened is,</v>

669
00:32:12.251 --> 00:32:14.280
<v Speaker 2>and this is an understatement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

670
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.420
<v Speaker 2>the roast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was roasted on comedy central,</v>

671
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.610
<v Speaker 2>but I had John Stamos was the roast </v>
<v Speaker 2>master.</v>

672
00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I had all my friends were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to pick who was on it.</v>

673
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

674
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Justin Bieber Roast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one knows him.</v>

675
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:27.523
<v Speaker 2>Most of the people and people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>roasting people is supposed to be mean </v>

676
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.513
<v Speaker 2>and it's a it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't come out of kindness and </v>

677
00:32:36.401 --> 00:32:41.401
<v Speaker 2>love of the person or just blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to attack them,</v>

678
00:32:41.991 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 2>but there's no attachment of anger to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

679
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.330
<v Speaker 2>It's just evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just wrong.</v>

680
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:50.300
<v Speaker 2>And we're in a society where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

681
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.420
<v Speaker 2>they'll hit you back on a tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll watch something,</v>

682
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:56.810
<v Speaker 2>you will see people on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll listen to political leaders talk,</v>

683
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.090
<v Speaker 2>you'll hear people bash each other back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth,</v>

684
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:04.420
<v Speaker 2>and it comes from Don rickles thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's what he did.</v>

685
00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.980
<v Speaker 2>That's not what the man did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man would,</v>

686
00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:11.960
<v Speaker 2>would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

687
00:33:11.961 --> 00:33:14.600
<v Speaker 2>see a man and a woman in the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

688
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:17.660
<v Speaker 2>is this your wife?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy would go yes and dom and go,</v>

689
00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:18.563
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

690
00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:22.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's just a but and his age has </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to do with it,</v>

691
00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:23.804
<v Speaker 2>but also his tenacity and his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he started in the lounge two in the </v>

692
00:33:28.521 --> 00:33:29.354
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing three shows til five in the </v>

693
00:33:30.561 --> 00:33:35.150
<v Speaker 2>morning and talk about the trenches and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all love.</v>

694
00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.343
<v Speaker 2>So if someone comes out and makes fun of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and does it out of love or does </v>

695
00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:43.034
<v Speaker 2>it at a truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the safest way we're at right </v>

696
00:33:44.841 --> 00:33:45.674
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the Chappelle thing comes </v>

697
00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:49.640
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you look at certain people.</v>

698
00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy Mark Marin a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

699
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Bill Burr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

700
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>so good,</v>

701
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

702
00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:06.410
<v Speaker 2>that some people don't even know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sell out places constantly that are</v>

703
00:34:08.331 --> 00:34:11.210
<v Speaker 2>just like Brian Regan and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so.</v>

704
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:12.420
<v Speaker 2>He's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

705
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.880
<v Speaker 2>he cares three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours.</v>

706
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.990
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

707
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:16.423
<v Speaker 2>And it's clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you go see Seinfeld do what he does </v>

708
00:34:18.501 --> 00:34:19.334
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why he's Jerry side because it's </v>

709
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:25.430
<v Speaker 2>not just words Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's connected to everything he did.</v>

710
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.640
<v Speaker 2>It might be word for word in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but another night.</v>

711
00:34:28.641 --> 00:34:31.770
<v Speaker 2>But my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun and you know,</v>

712
00:34:31.771 --> 00:34:32.930
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

713
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.123
<v Speaker 2>I love anybody who is funny who just is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to entertain people and it's not </v>

714
00:34:40.371 --> 00:34:41.204
<v Speaker 2>only about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hard because we're a very </v>

715
00:34:42.921 --> 00:34:43.880
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic group.</v>

716
00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean comics are particularly,</v>

717
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain breed of craziness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

718
00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:48.674
<v Speaker 1>That comes to comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best line I ever heard about that </v>

719
00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:50.630
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

720
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:51.493
<v Speaker 1>I've mentioned this a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin on the view once and he's </v>

721
00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:56.510
<v Speaker 1>sitting there with all the women around </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and he's talking about,</v>

722
00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was given,</v>

723
00:34:57.411 --> 00:34:59.240
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was selling or they had just come out</v>

724
00:34:59.241 --> 00:35:01.330
<v Speaker 1>with like this anthology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what he was there for.</v>

725
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.563
<v Speaker 1>But he said something about how to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good comic you have to have a ton of </v>

726
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:05.984
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have all this pain and </v>

727
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:07.904
<v Speaker 1>all this angst and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then at some point you got to </v>

728
00:35:11.391 --> 00:35:13.550
<v Speaker 1>conquer it because otherwise it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquer you.</v>

729
00:35:13.551 --> 00:35:16.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's why so many comics die of </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug overdoses and all this other stuff.</v>

730
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you can own it,</v>

731
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 1>then you could be 62.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

732
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:23.963
<v Speaker 2>why are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm made doing standup </v>

733
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.510
<v Speaker 2>at nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll be doing forms of it.</v>

734
00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.750
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't stop even if you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>

735
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.810
<v Speaker 2>I could not stop working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

736
00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I just directed this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin,</v>

737
00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.140
<v Speaker 2>which I'll talk about at length in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>third hour,</v>

738
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.830
<v Speaker 2>our interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

739
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.550
<v Speaker 2>but I have to leave after hour or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're welcome to.</v>

740
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:43.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to keep going.</v>

741
00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.540
<v Speaker 2>It's just gonna be me and the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

742
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:49.530
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love working without it.</v>

743
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.780
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

744
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

745
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.690
<v Speaker 2>and it sounds so fruity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pebbles to say that,</v>

746
00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:55.524
<v Speaker 2>but I just am and I always will be and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be making whether it be directing </v>

747
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 2>or writing or performing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love acting.</v>

748
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.553
<v Speaker 2>There's no limit as long as you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand and walk and bend and remember </v>

749
00:36:07.411 --> 00:36:08.091
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

750
00:36:08.091 --> 00:36:08.960
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

751
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.490
<v Speaker 2>not fall into an open trunk.</v>

752
00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 2>The memory one goes first because now </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's guys on Broadway,</v>

753
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:15.324
<v Speaker 2>they're using ips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say id ib is going to </v>

754
00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:24.630
<v Speaker 2>look at the intercontinental missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

755
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Not those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

756
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.760
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has been known and I hopefully will</v>

757
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:30.893
<v Speaker 2>live long enough that had 92 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be on Broadway and I'll have an </v>

758
00:36:34.711 --> 00:36:38.790
<v Speaker 2>earwig in and they'll feed me the lines </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't care if I'm good,</v>

759
00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:39.624
<v Speaker 2>if it's done right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw Peter O'toole and Amanda plummer </v>

760
00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:46.050
<v Speaker 2>and my Fair Lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most miscast version of my fair lady</v>

761
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:49.920
<v Speaker 2>on Broadway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think he had a thing in his ear.</v>

762
00:36:49.921 --> 00:36:50.754
<v Speaker 2>He was no child when he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Playing that character is very </v>

763
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:55.920
<v Speaker 2>fascinating because my fair lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a play,</v>

764
00:36:55.921 --> 00:36:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if people are familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

765
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.010
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the audience could use a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little tiny bit older,</v>

766
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:05.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a millennial's favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

767
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:08.550
<v Speaker 2>she is pygmalion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course loses more people.</v>

768
00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Gen x doesn't even follow pygmalion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

769
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.270
<v Speaker 2>what's amazing about it is he's 40 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>older than her.</v>

770
00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how you play that play.</v>

771
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a musical.</v>

772
00:37:20.011 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Was Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 40 years older than her.</v>

773
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:29.040
<v Speaker 2>He is maybe 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's 60 and she's 20 and that's that</v>

774
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.850
<v Speaker 2>and he's trying to make her a classy </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

775
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 2>The chauvinistically misogynistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable way.</v>

776
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.970
<v Speaker 2>And it is one of the best musicals ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>written for people that don't know.</v>

777
00:37:41.971 --> 00:37:42.804
<v Speaker 2>That was the original premise of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or that was the original inspiration of </v>

778
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:46.314
<v Speaker 2>pretty woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

779
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

780
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

781
00:37:49.231 --> 00:37:50.160
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

782
00:37:50.161 --> 00:37:53.280
<v Speaker 2>you're not usually trying to make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest woman out of,</v>

783
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:55.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an honest hooker.</v>

784
00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

785
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about this whole house thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that right from honest hooker.</v>

786
00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:01.443
<v Speaker 2>Hooker's you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to let you drop one of the </v>

787
00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:03.510
<v Speaker 2>girls names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

788
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

789
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.670
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you'd suddenly,</v>

790
00:38:05.671 --> 00:38:08.220
<v Speaker 2>you're on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows who you are,</v>

791
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.850
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of money is such a good edit </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

792
00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:12.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>

793
00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I've got offered the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

794
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.353
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fired from a morning program on </v>

795
00:38:17.101 --> 00:38:17.934
<v Speaker 2>CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was against Good Morning America </v>

796
00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.170
<v Speaker 2>today show for being too hot for morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>

797
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 2>They had another actor play the </v>
<v Speaker 2>character of Danny Tanner.</v>

798
00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always feel bad about that.</v>

799
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:32.430
<v Speaker 2>The pilot we shot with the pilot we shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone else makes me sad,</v>

800
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.413
<v Speaker 2>but the same producers and other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this business have done that before </v>

801
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:37.480
<v Speaker 2>with many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many shows.</v>

802
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Robin Williams was not the first work to</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect strangers.</v>

803
00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Was was not a Mark Lynn Baker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

804
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.840
<v Speaker 2>there was a gay housekeeper in the pilot</v>
<v Speaker 2>episode of the Golden Girls.</v>

805
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.823
<v Speaker 2>That guy got the boot I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I played on full house </v>

806
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:50.854
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

807
00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 2>But I ended up with the part because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was fired and they made it available for</v>

808
00:38:56.171 --> 00:38:58.780
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm Jeff Franklin.</v>

809
00:38:58.781 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 2>The exec producer wanted me originally </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it and Bob boy yet.</v>

810
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 2>And Tom Miller who still produced fuller</v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

811
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a complicated thing.</v>

812
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Show business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is so complicated.</v>

813
00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:12.130
<v Speaker 2>All you want to do is entertain a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>

814
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.713
<v Speaker 2>And then all of this stuff happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I played a character because I want </v>

815
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:18.640
<v Speaker 2>it to be on three men and a baby had </v>
<v Speaker 2>just come out.</v>

816
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:21.730
<v Speaker 2>And we were talking about that before we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were rolling on this.</v>

817
00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic show is we saw the Gutenberg a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner that night out of.</v>

818
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:30.510
<v Speaker 2>We did see the Gutenberg and he brings </v>
<v Speaker 2>his Bible and he went over almost.</v>

819
00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:32.683
<v Speaker 2>He had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had the fish and he had enough for </v>

820
00:39:34.661 --> 00:39:37.780
<v Speaker 2>everyone and the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess what it turned it to.</v>

821
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

822
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:43.420
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this part was something that I wanted in</v>

823
00:39:43.421 --> 00:39:48.200
<v Speaker 2>three men and a baby with Steven and Ted</v>
<v Speaker 2>Danson and um,</v>

824
00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:50.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

825
00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.193
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had just come out and so we were that </v>

826
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.960
<v Speaker 2>we were Dave and John David again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Demos were already diapering Ashley</v>

827
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:01.060
<v Speaker 2>and Mary Kate and I was not in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenes.</v>

828
00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.193
<v Speaker 2>So they reshot the pilot and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden the show ABC fought to keep it </v>

829
00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:07.840
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't happen like that anymore.</v>

830
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put it on twice a week.</v>

831
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:10.503
<v Speaker 2>It ran on Tuesdays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't run on Fridays and then they </v>

832
00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:13.894
<v Speaker 2>started to run it twice a week for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile and then they ordered more </v>

833
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:18.454
<v Speaker 2>episodes and it wasn't doing very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they believed in it and we were on </v>

834
00:40:21.131 --> 00:40:23.320
<v Speaker 2>against Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which also wasn't doing very well.</v>

835
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:23.751
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

836
00:40:23.751 --> 00:40:26.800
<v Speaker 2>So that's around what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 89 90 now at 87.</v>

837
00:40:26.801 --> 00:40:27.940
<v Speaker 2>80 eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

838
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

839
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.510
<v Speaker 2>So then 89 is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing well.</v>

840
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.750
<v Speaker 2>And then after four years we started to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do well,</v>

841
00:40:34.751 --> 00:40:35.584
<v Speaker 2>we switched studios from Sony because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know people want to give their </v>

842
00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:39.574
<v Speaker 2>demographics right on Google maps to </v>
<v Speaker 2>warner brothers to be on the same stage </v>

843
00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:48.271
<v Speaker 2>exactly where fuller house has done now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ended the last four years there.</v>

844
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:54.450
<v Speaker 2>And then it was a really big hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course with network television,</v>

845
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.200
<v Speaker 2>if you look at ratings now you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>

846
00:40:59.201 --> 00:41:00.810
<v Speaker 2>how could they cancel it with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>chair?</v>

847
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we were offered to go to the CW</v>

848
00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:04.744
<v Speaker 2>or the web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what it was first </v>

849
00:41:06.611 --> 00:41:07.444
<v Speaker 2>because it's all a blur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were offered one more year to go </v>

850
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 2>there and we just Kinda said John and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda,</v>

851
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.610
<v Speaker 2>I thought we did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

852
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:19.300
<v Speaker 2>we kinda got canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why do we want to beg to go somewhere</v>

853
00:41:19.301 --> 00:41:19.990
<v Speaker 2>else?</v>

854
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.823
<v Speaker 2>And they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they say columns and it never </v>

855
00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:22.710
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

856
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:24.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're somewhere else.</v>

857
00:41:24.341 --> 00:41:27.310
<v Speaker 2>And then people find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would they do it for is for syndication.</v>

858
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:28.550
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

859
00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:31.360
<v Speaker 2>what years is that from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything looks different,</v>

860
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:32.943
<v Speaker 2>it looks smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was the secret to that show was </v>

861
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:42.610
<v Speaker 2>that there was actual affection between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cast and uh,</v>

862
00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:43.563
<v Speaker 2>and in good writing and good morals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things where kids could watch your </v>

863
00:41:46.041 --> 00:41:50.420
<v Speaker 2>sister could watch it and feel good </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards because they had my sister,</v>

864
00:41:50.421 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Tanya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tanya,</v>

865
00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:52.893

<v Speaker 2>you were great in rocky and that's </v>

866
00:41:55.131 --> 00:41:55.970
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

867
00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.440
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>

868
00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brother loves you very,</v>

869
00:42:00.171 --> 00:42:01.004
<v Speaker 2>very much and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really appreciate that you would </v>

870
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.560
<v Speaker 2>make them all watch full house instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of having Nice,</v>

871
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.200
<v Speaker 2>nice dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

872
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.740
<v Speaker 2>he'd make the dinner nights here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

873
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.033
<v Speaker 2>let's do just a little bit more on TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I want to talk politics with </v>

874
00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 2>you and just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a philosophical guy.</v>

875
00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 2>I am a philosophical guide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets me in trouble sometimes.</v>

876
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 2>So you do fuller house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

877
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.583
<v Speaker 2>Big Star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're also doing America's </v>

878
00:42:23.691 --> 00:42:24.524
<v Speaker 2>funniest home videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing where it's a blooper show </v>

879
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:29.030
<v Speaker 2>and I'm playing on Sunday night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven to 8:00</v>

880
00:42:29.031 --> 00:42:31.400
<v Speaker 2>at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were in church that day,</v>

881
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.413
<v Speaker 2>so then that night I'm hosting a show </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to be done very palatable for </v>

882
00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:39.920
<v Speaker 2>America and the world was number one in </v>
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

883
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Where was that hard for you because you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

884
00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:43.300
<v Speaker 2>you really had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

885
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.530
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That had to.</v>

886
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:48.830
<v Speaker 2>It was a little difficult and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gift horse so the tree opens up,</v>

887
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the number one show,</v>

888
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:55.970
<v Speaker 2>the producer of into bona called me one </v>
<v Speaker 2>day on my curly cord carphone and said,</v>

889
00:42:55.971 --> 00:42:57.530
<v Speaker 2>we're number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

890
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.530
<v Speaker 2>you mean PP anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

891
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

892
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.830
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're number one show on television.</v>

893
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:04.663
<v Speaker 2>It was a phenomenon and the joke is if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to see a man get hit in the </v>

894
00:43:09.951 --> 00:43:11.240
<v Speaker 2>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to come through me.</v>

895
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I was the gatekeeper but in a funny way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now it's all this I.</v>

896
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Youtube will give you anything you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I was going to say.</v>

897
00:43:18.741 --> 00:43:19.574
<v Speaker 2>That somehow all of the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people click that's just quick and you </v>

898
00:43:22.821 --> 00:43:25.310
<v Speaker 2>watch someone get smashed with saying or</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was sending her fault.</v>

899
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.323
<v Speaker 2>It was all born out of people walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around with cam quarters just because </v>

900
00:43:28.551 --> 00:43:29.930
<v Speaker 2>you guys were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

901
00:43:29.931 --> 00:43:31.640
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had the savvy,</v>

902
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a famous show.</v>

903
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:34.064
<v Speaker 2>It came out of a show in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think are still partners with </v>

904
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:37.340
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the business dealings,</v>

905
00:43:37.341 --> 00:43:38.810
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me a minute.</v>

906
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Let me just get on my phone.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll do it right here.</v>

909
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:44.990
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

910
00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:48.950
<v Speaker 2>it became a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a phenomenon because they took a,</v>

911
00:43:48.951 --> 00:43:51.950
<v Speaker 2>did it amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did the grassroots approach,</v>

912
00:43:51.951 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 2>which we don't see anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They asked in people magazine.</v>

913
00:43:56.811 --> 00:43:57.644
<v Speaker 2>They took out an ad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a new show called America's </v>

917
00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:11.943
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is how they got the first hour </v>

918
00:44:15.291 --> 00:44:16.124
<v Speaker 2>of tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happened to me was I was doing </v>

919
00:44:17.511 --> 00:44:20.150
<v Speaker 2>a year of full house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get this tape.</v>

920
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Speaker 2>They said this is an amicable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a young man.</v>

921
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:25.430
<v Speaker 2>The man that now is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is Walt Disney,</v>

922
00:44:25.431 --> 00:44:27.530
<v Speaker 2>is Bob Iger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is ABC.</v>

923
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:31.070
<v Speaker 2>He wanted me for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Harbert was at the network,</v>

924
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.290
<v Speaker 2>wanted me for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from full house.</v>

925
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I seemed like a very amicable guy.</v>

926
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 2>They'd seen my standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't care.</v>

927
00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:42.360
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't as a bluish as I became,</v>

928
00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:45.000
<v Speaker 2>as I got more free with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to ask you about that.</v>

929
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't draw as many f bombs,</v>

930
00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.960
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was all weird.</v>

931
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:52.500
<v Speaker 2>It all had things that you can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was that like for you?</v>

932
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:53.334
<v Speaker 2>Because he was still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously I'm not telling you </v>

933
00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:55.704
<v Speaker 2>anything you to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like he was so sacral and the jokes </v>

934
00:44:57.031 --> 00:44:59.120
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to make and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm proud of them.</v>

935
00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote it with two.</v>

936
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the jokes were to Canadian guys,</v>

937
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:05.940
<v Speaker 2>so there was an 18 percent exchange rate</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the humor,</v>

938
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:07.590
<v Speaker 2>but it was todd.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And we wrote all the jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wrote 55 pages a week.</v>

944
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.830
<v Speaker 2>I would do the voiceovers look out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But who is Marvin the Martian?</v>

951
00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:39.930
<v Speaker 2>You made me so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Marvin the Martian.</v>

952
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a good impression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

953
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a big production to.</v>

954
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:49.890
<v Speaker 2>I wanted it to be a variety show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we would have big guests on.</v>

955
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:53.250
<v Speaker 2>We'd have on a Rodney Dangerfield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody that was a friend of mine,</v>

956
00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:55.350
<v Speaker 2>we'd had Leslie Nielsen on Jonathan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Winters,</v>

957
00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:57.100
<v Speaker 2>full house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

958
00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:01.020
<v Speaker 2>we'd have and it was an hour and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is still on to this day,</v>

959
00:46:01.021 --> 00:46:03.870
<v Speaker 2>a testament to Vin and to the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that make that show,</v>

960
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went to Tom Bergeron,</v>

961
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 2>went through many people that went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard kind hosted at wants,</v>

962
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.070
<v Speaker 2>daisy frontage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Fugelsang.</v>

963
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:12.753
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no way to stop it because it </v>

964
00:46:15.061 --> 00:46:18.630
<v Speaker 2>was a guaranteed laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I didn't like,</v>

965
00:46:18.631 --> 00:46:19.464
<v Speaker 2>what would bother me is if a guy falls </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a manhole and then you see somebody </v>

966
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:25.230
<v Speaker 2>in the audience to other head back </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing,</v>

967
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:28.480
<v Speaker 2>but you never see him climb out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manhole on like,</v>

968
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 2>is he dead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

969
00:46:30.271 --> 00:46:32.520
<v Speaker 2>So I hadn't done a charity for people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuts.</v>

970
00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Like with Bob Saget charity for a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

971
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

972
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Agates Sag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's agates something that would have.</v>

973
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there should have been people.</v>

974
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:46.710
<v Speaker 2>There were a lot of not hits and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the good ones were when it was a six</v>

975
00:46:46.711 --> 00:46:50.040
<v Speaker 2>year old taking a baseball bat and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>chest just jab and his dad.</v>

976
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:51.563
<v Speaker 2>Even just before this I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just quickly put Americans money </v>

977
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:57.840
<v Speaker 2>selling videos in the youtube search and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not hit after hit.</v>

978
00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:00.420
<v Speaker 2>There's one that's like 600 hits in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>row.</v>

979
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.433
<v Speaker 2>I mean they just cut him real quick </v>
<v Speaker 2>because one thing that got to me was </v>

980
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.980
<v Speaker 2>someone had sent me a clip reel that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they aired on the show,</v>

981
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:10.750
<v Speaker 2>which was old people falling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had,</v>

982
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:13.320
<v Speaker 2>when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I'm not there because that was,</v>

983
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.000
<v Speaker 2>that was the only time I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

984
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.960
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

985
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.273
<v Speaker 2>And they're falling on cement and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sounds funny to Bros in a bar </v>

986
00:47:20.941 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 2>drinking beers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you'll watch it,</v>

987
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:25.820
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of snuff fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

988
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.693
<v Speaker 2>as long as I know everybody's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be a where people </v>

989
00:47:29.861 --> 00:47:34.861
<v Speaker 2>filmed themselves hurting their friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I felt like I was hurting before.</v>

990
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.400
<v Speaker 2>But that didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

991
00:47:38.401 --> 00:47:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed for those first few years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

992
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved the hell out of it.</v>

993
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody was talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and loving it.</v>

994
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I had friends calling me going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

995
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.113
<v Speaker 2>Because no one had seen it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting because it's like </v>

996
00:47:53.861 --> 00:47:55.920
<v Speaker 2>kind of one of those things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have anymore.</v>

997
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't have shows being right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things like,</v>

998
00:47:59.201 --> 00:48:00.660
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone watches game of thrones,</v>

999
00:48:00.661 --> 00:48:01.494
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone watches this or that on </v>

1000
00:48:02.051 --> 00:48:02.884
<v Speaker 2>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we don't have like sort of </v>

1001
00:48:04.271 --> 00:48:08.750
<v Speaker 2>mainstream like decent things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>families can watch anymore.</v>

1002
00:48:08.751 --> 00:48:11.050
<v Speaker 2>And they know and they put all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense aside,</v>

1003
00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I want to do.</v>

1004
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.520
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1005
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in talks about a couple of different</v>

1006
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do something,</v>

1007
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:19.180
<v Speaker 2>a variety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

1008
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1009
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love directing,</v>

1010
00:48:21.341 --> 00:48:23.860
<v Speaker 2>so I just did this movie so we knock on </v>
<v Speaker 2>wood people,</v>

1011
00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:25.270
<v Speaker 2>go see this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin,</v>

1012
00:48:25.271 --> 00:48:27.240
<v Speaker 2>which we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to it for a second.</v>

1013
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Let's get to it right now if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that that was the right way,</v>

1014
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:32.410
<v Speaker 2>but I will give closure to that last </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1015
00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Just saying that I do feel that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be,</v>

1016
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.340
<v Speaker 2>it would be wonderful to have a family </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit down on a Sunday night.</v>

1017
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean wonderful world of Disney used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be on at 7:00</v>

1018
00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:44.554
<v Speaker 2>or 7:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid on NBC and you turn it </v>

1019
00:48:47.141 --> 00:48:50.950
<v Speaker 2>on now and it's just another one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people punching each other in,</v>

1020
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.863
<v Speaker 2>in big sumo wrestler costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not what I want to see with </v>

1021
00:48:54.611 --> 00:48:55.760
<v Speaker 2>my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it,</v>

1022
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.230
<v Speaker 2>but that's the cheap replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's variety,</v>

1023
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.513
<v Speaker 2>that's reality variety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but real variety is we're going to </v>

1024
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:08.560
<v Speaker 2>entertain you and we're going to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>on guests and it's going to be fun.</v>

1025
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:09.394
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess snl is the closest thing to </v>

1026
00:49:10.601 --> 00:49:11.350
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1027
00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not really.</v>

1028
00:49:12.371 --> 00:49:14.500
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't play in prime time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you want something,</v>

1029
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:16.480
<v Speaker 2>you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want something that's funny,</v>

1030
00:49:16.481 --> 00:49:19.240
<v Speaker 2>but also you can do some serious stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to staying relevant.</v>

1031
00:49:19.241 --> 00:49:19.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1032
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:20.950
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can have everything,</v>

1033
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:26.350
<v Speaker 2>but I think it needs to make people </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh the most and then it can have its,</v>

1034
00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:27.203
<v Speaker 2>its waves in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I will be taking pitches right </v>

1035
00:49:30.341 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Speaker 2>after this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It is an independent movie.</v>

1039
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm very low budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just getting hit in the nuts.</v>

1040

1047
00:49:58.031 --> 00:49:58.864
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is most families and we believe </v>

1048
00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:02.764
<v Speaker 2>that I directed it and I acted in it </v>

<v Speaker 2>We think that he is on crystal meth.</v>

1054
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:20.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's a dark comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you meant the actor.</v>

<v Speaker 2>low budget.</v>

1062
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:42.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this show has longer to shoot my </v>

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's not where you post an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention.</v>

1069
00:51:01.631 --> 00:51:04.240
<v Speaker 2>People don't post interventions on </v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>

1070
00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.240
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be kind of quiet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>done properly.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1078
00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:27.813
<v Speaker 2>it's an ensemble and it takes place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>one night and it's just basically the </v>

1079
00:51:33.341 --> 00:51:38.341
<v Speaker 2>one line would be on it that the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person you think has the problem.</v>

1080
00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:41.913
<v Speaker 2>It's the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't really give much more </v>

1081
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:46.270
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The family,</v>

1082
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:49.090
<v Speaker 2>your family is the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>

1083
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:49.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1084
00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.450
<v Speaker 2>So many write a one line for this movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

1085
00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need it for the one sheet.</v>

1086
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.800
<v Speaker 2>But the people that you think have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1087
00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:01.720
<v Speaker 2>the people that are accusing someone of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having the problem are the ones with the</v>

1088
00:52:01.721 --> 00:52:03.150
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1089
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.180
<v Speaker 2>that's a spoiler alert.</v>

1090
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.053
<v Speaker 1>That's a little bit of a spoiler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like that transcends this </v>

1091
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:08.180
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a general thing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you for letting me plug all of that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That my career is just beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We Ngo or career ended my career </v>

1098
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.740
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ended.</v>

1099
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:29.990
<v Speaker 1>We never got past fuller house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

1100
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:30.501
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We know we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got other stuff coming.</v>

1103
00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even talk about a half baked,</v>

1104
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.433
<v Speaker 1>but we'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just say that it never actually </v>

1105
00:52:38.871 --> 00:52:42.190
<v Speaker 1>did that in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My real.</v>

1106
00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1107
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:44.151
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

1108
00:52:44.151 --> 00:52:44.984
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to talk about politics and </v>

1109
00:52:45.651 --> 00:52:46.484
<v Speaker 1>just kind of what you think is going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world because if that's what you </v>

1110
00:52:48.531 --> 00:52:49.730
<v Speaker 1>do here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what I do here.</v>

1111
00:52:49.731 --> 00:52:50.564
<v Speaker 1>But even though I only know you a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit from the conversation we had at </v>

1112
00:52:52.821 --> 00:52:53.654
<v Speaker 1>dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got just got a sense that like you </v>

1113
00:52:55.281 --> 00:52:58.250
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously very sensitive.</v>

1114
00:52:58.251 --> 00:53:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Like that's pretty clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm overly sensitive or you strike me as</v>

1115
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:01.874
<v Speaker 1>like a good liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you want people to be treated well </v>

1116
00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:06.830
<v Speaker 1>as fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of myself as a liberal.</v>

1117
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I must be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1118
00:53:08.731 --> 00:53:09.820
<v Speaker 1>what do I look good?</v>

1119
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:10.783
<v Speaker 2>Myself as a humanist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a plane the other day which no </v>

1120
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:17.700
<v Speaker 2>comedians ever said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and transducers,</v>

1121
00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:18.633
<v Speaker 2>that gentleman was on the plane and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a and he was about 60 years old and </v>

1122
00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:27.480
<v Speaker 2>he seemed like a successful businessman </v>
<v Speaker 2>of some kind.</v>

1123
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 2>And I was in the first class section </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was a cat back in coach.</v>

1124
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 2>It was a cat for a case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get sick.</v>

1125
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:35.484
<v Speaker 2>She had her</v>

1126
00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:38.620
<v Speaker 1>security animal to keep her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you call those animals?</v>

1127
00:53:38.621 --> 00:53:39.454
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a special animal if special needs or </v>

1128
00:53:46.271 --> 00:53:47.890
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm deathly allergic.</v>

1129
00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.870
<v Speaker 1>So I was upfront and allergic to cats </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1130
00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:51.163
<v Speaker 2>Think so I was saying to this gentleman </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had on big bright Red America </v>

1131
00:53:56.091 --> 00:54:01.091
<v Speaker 2>first shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if I was uh,</v>

1132
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:02.800
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1133
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:07.580
<v Speaker 2>what your brand is a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that shirt would bother me.</v>

1134
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:11.030
<v Speaker 2>But I just looked at the guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed like a nice guy.</v>

1135
00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said,</v>

1136
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:15.140
<v Speaker 2>do you have an allergy to cats?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went,</v>

1137
00:54:15.141 --> 00:54:17.060
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife's got a cat.</v>

1138
00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have a category?</v>

1139
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:19.463
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife has a cat and we laughed a </v>

1140
00:54:21.771 --> 00:54:25.440
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it said on his shirt,</v>

1141
00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:29.960
<v Speaker 2>on his shirt is a shirt I would wear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a where I'm at.</v>

1142
00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe a tube.</v>

1143
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I love America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that where you live,</v>

1144
00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.270
<v Speaker 2>you want to put first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to take care of your people,</v>

1145
00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.890
<v Speaker 2>you want to take care of your hometown.</v>

1146
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.033
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're coming out with that far right </v>

1147
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.014
<v Speaker 1>craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you want to take care of your </v>

1148
00:54:46.981 --> 00:54:47.814
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1149
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.840
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1150
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.890
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1151
00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:51.411
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1152
00:54:51.411 --> 00:54:51.990
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1153
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.823
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1154
00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:54.520
<v Speaker 2>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not.</v>

1155
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:55.873
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're kind and you're not out doing </v>

1156
00:54:58.241 --> 00:55:01.000
<v Speaker 2>some closet hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1157
00:55:01.001 --> 00:55:03.940
<v Speaker 2>or blatant hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1158
00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:05.403
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just look at my dad's whole thing was </v>

1159
00:55:08.231 --> 00:55:09.064
<v Speaker 2>be kind to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it sounds like a pacifist and might </v>

1160
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.300
<v Speaker 2>bother people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what we're supposed to do.</v>

1161
00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the problem with that,</v>

1162
00:55:17.701 --> 00:55:19.620
<v Speaker 1>that you just get nipped off by both </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides?</v>

1163
00:55:19.621 --> 00:55:20.454
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that a lot now that I do think </v>

1164
00:55:21.301 --> 00:55:23.050
<v Speaker 1>there's this interesting center </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing.</v>

1165
00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know why there's sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1166
00:55:25.781 --> 00:55:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I do.</v>

1167
00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.120
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1168
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.060
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people go,</v>

1169
00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:31.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a democrat.</v>

1170
00:55:31.991 --> 00:55:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1171
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll vote for anybody that can get us </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this mess.</v>

1172
00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:37.623
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>

1173
00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd bring my dad back from the grave and</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote for him.</v>

1174
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.870
<v Speaker 2>He'd be such a good candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A grateful dead video.</v>

1175
00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1176
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you consider yourself a liberal?</v>

1177
00:55:50.301 --> 00:55:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Is that where you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:52.214
<v Speaker 1>I still consider myself a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the liberal things that I </v>

1179
00:55:55.341 --> 00:55:56.174
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can pretty much explain from a </v>

1180
00:55:57.921 --> 00:55:58.754
<v Speaker 1>libertarian perspective at this point </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that I just don't want the </v>

1181
00:56:00.651 --> 00:56:02.510
<v Speaker 1>government involved in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1182
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:03.763
<v Speaker 1>And I think you should live your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>however you see fit and I'll live mine </v>

1183
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:08.690
<v Speaker 1>however I see fit and like you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot more money than me,</v>

1184
00:56:08.691 --> 00:56:09.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair to say.</v>

1185
00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:10.663
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to do spreadsheet exams </v>

1186
00:56:12.081 --> 00:56:13.670
<v Speaker 1>right after this is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be clear.</v>

1187
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been on network television.</v>

1188
00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.280
<v Speaker 1>You've got three chickens outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have three chickens.</v>

1189
00:56:19.281 --> 00:56:21.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know their value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could have chickens.</v>

1190
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:22.723
<v Speaker 1>The point is I don't any of your stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you make more money than </v>

1191
00:56:25.571 --> 00:56:26.410
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1192
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't have any of your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be nice I suppose,</v>

1193
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 1>but I don't deserve any of that.</v>

1194
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:31.303
<v Speaker 2>That's what taxes are about and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>where our are incredibly rich society </v>

1195
00:56:36.801 --> 00:56:37.634
<v Speaker 2>and are incredibly poor society are at </v>
<v Speaker 2>odds with each other and that has been </v>

1196
00:56:41.241 --> 00:56:42.074
<v Speaker 2>since the beginning of time since you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know castles were built with a dictator </v>

1197
00:56:47.121 --> 00:56:51.590
<v Speaker 2>in a king living in it and everybody had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go build all this stuff and they were</v>

1198
00:56:51.591 --> 00:56:54.930
<v Speaker 2>slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's it,</v>

1199
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.960
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The metaphor doesn't change.</v>

1200
00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.393
<v Speaker 2>The representation doesn't change that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the downtrodden or downtrodden and are </v>

1201
00:57:01.971 --> 00:57:02.804
<v Speaker 2>disgruntled and then other people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry at things that they should just </v>

1202
00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.900
<v Speaker 2>take a frikken chill pill over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1203
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Well that constant outreach thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1204
00:57:14.511 --> 00:57:18.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot to be outraged over also </v>
<v Speaker 2>because how do they all have the,</v>

1205
00:57:18.121 --> 00:57:20.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with,</v>

1206
00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:22.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to entertain people with wanting</v>

1207
00:57:22.671 --> 00:57:23.504
<v Speaker 2>to be a comedian is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nearly impossible when there's so </v>

1208
00:57:27.201 --> 00:57:30.440
<v Speaker 2>many deaths when there's so many tragic </v>
<v Speaker 2>things happening,</v>

1209
00:57:30.441 --> 00:57:31.274
<v Speaker 2>which there always have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we are at a news ratio where it's </v>

1210
00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:39.800
<v Speaker 2>coming at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

1211
00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:42.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit your computer on and it says,</v>

1212
00:57:42.471 --> 00:57:43.304
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>news alert and you hit news alert and </v>

1213
00:57:45.111 --> 00:57:47.360
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid to hit the button.</v>

1214
00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:51.860
<v Speaker 2>You're afraid to get up in the Morton </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hit whatever new service you go.</v>

1215
00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:53.053
<v Speaker 1>So that's just a matter of us knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it more because I have steven </v>

1216
00:57:55.401 --> 00:57:57.470
<v Speaker 1>pinker on next week who's a harvard </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist who,</v>

1217
00:57:57.471 --> 00:58:01.730
<v Speaker 1>and his whole argument is actually that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are better than they've ever been</v>

1218
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.863
<v Speaker 1>using empirical scientific evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the amount of people that are </v>

1219
00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:09.950
<v Speaker 1>being exposed quicker because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have more people out of poverty</v>

1220
00:58:09.951 --> 00:58:10.784
<v Speaker 1>now worldwide than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people with drinkable water than </v>

1221
00:58:13.611 --> 00:58:17.120
<v Speaker 1>ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people that leave the environment,</v>

1222
00:58:17.121 --> 00:58:18.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment values and every port.</v>

1223
00:58:18.951 --> 00:58:19.784
<v Speaker 1>But we</v>

1224
00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.640
<v Speaker 2>why more people would drinkable water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:26.630
<v Speaker 2>More the around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know around the world more now than ever</v>

1226
00:58:26.631 --> 00:58:28.580
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that might be true.</v>

1227
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we a hundred percent?</v>

1228
00:58:31.401 --> 00:58:33.140
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that's true.</v>

1229
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:36.500
<v Speaker 2>But what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about more people being murdered?</v>

1230
00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.930
<v Speaker 2>What about the safety of our kids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>

1231
00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:41.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things over,</v>

1232
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:43.130
<v Speaker 2>but most of those,</v>

1233
00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:46.490
<v Speaker 1>most of those markers actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're better than ever before.</v>

1234
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just that we hear about them all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time now and we obsess over it.</v>

1235
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Not that we obsess over the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1236
00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:57.310
<v Speaker 2>because we're not presented the positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if we're presented the positive,</v>

1237
00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:01.450
<v Speaker 2>it's through a skewed broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1238
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:02.333
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really presented by someone </v>

1239
00:59:04.391 --> 00:59:05.224
<v Speaker 2>that comfort to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The show comforts you more than most </v>

1240
00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:14.740
<v Speaker 2>shows because of the way you handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a fact.</v>

1241
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:17.260
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to have watched you </v>
<v Speaker 2>several times,</v>

1242
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:18.363
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to put two factions </v>
<v Speaker 2>together that might have similar or </v>

1243
00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:27.191
<v Speaker 2>report pose views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing opposed views and are saying,</v>

1244
00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:28.844
<v Speaker 2>why can't it be like this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you try to go toward an </v>

1245
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:32.444
<v Speaker 2>idealistic goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dream of it is how you can almost </v>

1246
00:59:38.361 --> 00:59:39.800
<v Speaker 2>get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1247
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:42.440
<v Speaker 2>that's how the country was founded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Besides,</v>

1248
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:43.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a lot of things away from the </v>

1249
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:47.390
<v Speaker 2>people that lived here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole other show.</v>

1250
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.450
<v Speaker 2>But you've got three Cox in your yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good.</v>

1251
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:52.140
<v Speaker 2>So I just trying to get you out of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1252
00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really politically astute but </v>
<v Speaker 2>did I make any sense?</v>

1253
00:59:58.511 --> 01:00:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you aren't making some sense,</v>

1254
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:01.930
<v Speaker 2>but I think you actually articulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1255
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're around tomorrow at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1256
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:04.583
<v Speaker 2>That must be a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw just last night and he said Aloha </v>

1257
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 2>because we were in Hawaii together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do say that I'd rather get my news</v>

1258
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:13.160
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1259
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.113
<v Speaker 2>from John Oliver and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert and </v>

1260
01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>newscasters.</v>

1261
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.263
<v Speaker 2>What does that tell you about US media?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need a relief and so the news itself </v>

1262
01:00:26.421 --> 01:00:27.254
<v Speaker 2>is already a parody and it's also so </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessive no matter where it's coming </v>

1263
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:31.994
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're also dealing with a regime </v>

1264
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:34.993
<v Speaker 2>which flip flops in the media and on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter faster than I've ever exist </v>

1265
01:00:40.921 --> 01:00:43.310
<v Speaker 2>because we never had a president tweet </v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

1266
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did.</v>

1267
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama did,</v>

1268
01:00:47.091 --> 01:00:48.980
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like,</v>

1269
01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:50.600
<v Speaker 2>I hate this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love this,</v>

1270
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:51.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

1271
01:00:51.951 --> 01:00:53.260
<v Speaker 2>21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>21,</v>

1272
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.500
<v Speaker 2>18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're in Vegas,</v>

1273
01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:56.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just double down.</v>

1274
01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you see him as the problem though?</v>

1275
01:00:58.551 --> 01:01:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Or is a symptom because I really see the</v>
<v Speaker 2>symptom.</v>

1276
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a symptom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1277
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:08.050
<v Speaker 2>it was voting for a guy that was on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>show that said,</v>

1278
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.610
<v Speaker 2>you're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you expect to get?</v>

1279
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1280
01:01:12.261 --> 01:01:13.094
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to get the host of </v>

1281
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:15.793
<v Speaker 2>America's got talent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get the most out of </v>

1282
01:01:18.051 --> 01:01:18.884
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be the best a </v>

1283
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.830
<v Speaker 2>procession ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be dancers and singers.</v>

1284
01:01:24.831 --> 01:01:26.600
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had been the president,</v>

1285
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.440
<v Speaker 2>people would be getting be at a Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes you,</v>

1286
01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:32.930
<v Speaker 2>you would from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you a dick joke a day.</v>

1287
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:36.080
<v Speaker 2>And I would treat them and not three in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning.</v>

1288
01:01:36.081 --> 01:01:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I do not tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1289
01:01:37.251 --> 01:01:39.280
<v Speaker 2>three in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one should note,</v>

1290
01:01:39.281 --> 01:01:41.090
<v Speaker 2>well no one except the president </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1291
01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.780
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just think you know,</v>

1292
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.553
<v Speaker 2>what did we expect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think a lot of people were </v>

1293
01:01:48.231 --> 01:01:49.064
<v Speaker 2>surprised and I think it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening and this is it and so we </v>

1294
01:01:53.721 --> 01:01:54.554
<v Speaker 2>want to better humanity and there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>great people in the world and there are </v>

1295
01:01:58.731 --> 01:01:59.564
<v Speaker 2>great people in other countries leading </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world the best they can and there's </v>

1296
01:02:04.881 --> 01:02:05.714
<v Speaker 2>a lot of slackers and there's other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are just part of the </v>

1297
01:02:07.521 --> 01:02:08.354
<v Speaker 2>political bunch of crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're still great people and </v>

1298
01:02:12.411 --> 01:02:16.160
<v Speaker 2>there's great people watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nice people watching your show.</v>

1299
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a nice person.</v>

1300
01:02:17.421 --> 01:02:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

1301
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you get a lot of haters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you get a ridiculous amount of haters</v>

1302
01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.040
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1303
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I talk about the problems that I</v>

1304
01:02:25.201 --> 01:02:26.034
<v Speaker 2>see with the modern day left and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals and they don't like someone to </v>

1305
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.833
<v Speaker 2>address those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was once one of them by fake </v>

1306
01:02:33.841 --> 01:02:35.190
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't I know they,</v>

1307
01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 2>they don't fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't fall for that.</v>

1308
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Perfect shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

1309
01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.300
<v Speaker 2>you could calm me down through tightrope</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking.</v>

1310
01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:47.340
<v Speaker 2>That was because we slipped a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying in your water.</v>

1311
01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 2>There is something in my water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling different.</v>

1312
01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:50.394
<v Speaker 2>You notice the tone has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not leaving them on the show </v>

1313
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.780
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise vibrating it.</v>

1314
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Though.</v>

1315
01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:56.820
<v Speaker 2>I bet things moved in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1316
01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Is there anyone that chart behind you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1317
01:03:00.301 --> 01:03:03.090
<v Speaker 2>that it's just Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an eye chart.</v>

1318
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.073
<v Speaker 2>Pretty clever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1319
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.180
<v Speaker 2>That's really it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call that art.</v>

1320
01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Get well done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

1321
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good.</v>

1322
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.533
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anyone that you're paying </v>

1323
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:12.360
<v Speaker 2>attention to these days that you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>is making some sense?</v>

1324
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Because I appreciate all the comments </v>
<v Speaker 2>but the compliments,</v>

1325
01:03:14.731 --> 01:03:15.564
<v Speaker 2>but like that's what I think I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>here is just trying to make a little </v>

1326
01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:20.550
<v Speaker 2>census of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be honest,</v>

1327
01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:23.420
<v Speaker 2>John Oliver has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1328
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of anyone political that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has made me go,</v>

1329
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.600
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great hope there.</v>

1330
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm interested in something.</v>

1331
01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Some people have to say that seemed wow </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was noble,</v>

1332
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:41.550
<v Speaker 2>but they're not going to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it or they're not going to run or.</v>

1333
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:44.250
<v Speaker 2>But I'd like to think there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>

1334
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:45.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to think you think that's part </v>

1335
01:03:47.521 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we all talk a lot,</v>

1336
01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 2>but we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I sense that sort of what's happening</v>

1337
01:03:51.451 --> 01:03:53.700
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that everyone's saying shit,</v>

1338
01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.330
<v Speaker 2>we're fighting always just a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking voices.</v>

1339
01:03:57.331 --> 01:04:00.330
<v Speaker 2>It's frequencies everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All through our heads.</v>

1340
01:04:00.331 --> 01:04:01.164
<v Speaker 2>It's just noise.</v>

1341
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.190
<v Speaker 2>So trump was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1342
01:04:02.191 --> 01:04:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of you do anything.</v>

1343
01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:05.010
<v Speaker 2>And trump's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1344
01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll run for president.</v>

1345
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:08.040
<v Speaker 2>You Morons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>

1346
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:09.510
<v Speaker 2>He was right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1347
01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:12.330
<v Speaker 2>And the way he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can turn anything.</v>

1348
01:04:12.331 --> 01:04:13.164
<v Speaker 2>He wants to do a rally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he feels the moment and he gets the </v>

1349
01:04:16.021 --> 01:04:21.021
<v Speaker 2>right South Park background behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's doing it and I don't know,</v>

1350
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too.</v>

1351
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:28.103
<v Speaker 2>You can't predict a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we want that security is feeling </v>

1352
01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>secure that you know at least what </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow brings.</v>

1353
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.380
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what an hour from now </v>
<v Speaker 2>brings.</v>

1354
01:04:40.381 --> 01:04:41.214
<v Speaker 2>We have never been on our haunches more </v>
<v Speaker 2>not knowing what's gonna come out of </v>

1355
01:04:46.261 --> 01:04:47.790
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the White House.</v>

1356
01:04:47.791 --> 01:04:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to get fired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the issue.</v>

1357
01:04:50.371 --> 01:04:51.204
<v Speaker 2>The issue is where's the world at and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where's our kids at and where are the </v>

1358
01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:57.150
<v Speaker 2>things that really matter.</v>

1359
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:57.983
<v Speaker 2>What really matters is people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is sort of like you're giving me </v>

1360
01:05:01.471 --> 01:05:05.190
<v Speaker 2>the ending of a full house episode and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to tell you something else.</v>

1361
01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:06.893
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you drinking beer at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prompt and you cannot have a horse in </v>

1362
01:05:10.261 --> 01:05:13.080
<v Speaker 2>the living room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where the synthesizer music.</v>

1363
01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:13.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1364
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.233
<v Speaker 2>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always follow your gut because your gut </v>

1365
01:05:18.121 --> 01:05:20.620
<v Speaker 2>is not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you feel it deep inside,</v>

1366
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.690
<v Speaker 2>then take imodium because any moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>there could be a release.</v>

1367
01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could have done full house like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1368
01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:29.253
<v Speaker 2>That would have been nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just full of diarrhea and give you a </v>

1369
01:05:30.821 --> 01:05:32.920
<v Speaker 2>chance for bloopers like that where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could just.</v>

1370
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:33.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1371
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Bloopers grills that were that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said horrific things.</v>

1372
01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's is.</v>

1373
01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.250
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book called dirty daddy and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>told.</v>

1374
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:45.400
<v Speaker 2>I talked about something I did on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>set once and I got in a lot of trouble,</v>

1375
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:49.600
<v Speaker 2>but I won't say what it is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not repeatable on this youtube channel,</v>

1376
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:54.310
<v Speaker 2>but it is in that book and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something I should not have done,</v>

1377
01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:55.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>

1378
01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:57.123
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1379
01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:58.870
<v Speaker 2>well I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say it,</v>

1380
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 2>but it was something that happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have been.</v>

1381
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did something that we,</v>

1382
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.823
<v Speaker 2>we had stand ins for the kids that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>mannequins and I was alone on the set </v>

1383
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:15.660
<v Speaker 2>with just the crew and the monitors were</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and I didn't know that.</v>

1384
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Not acceptable under these conditions or</v>
<v Speaker 2>under this time.</v>

1385
01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.393
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever worry about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you still know because </v>

1386
01:06:25.471 --> 01:06:29.340
<v Speaker 2>everything I've done is when someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:31.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1395

<v Speaker 2>there's a story in there in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in zero to 60 does special where I say I</v>

1396
01:06:48.991 --> 01:06:52.450
<v Speaker 2>was given ludes by a club owner which </v>
<v Speaker 2>were serious drug.</v>

1397
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:55.920
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like a roofie terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug from wolf of Wall Street,</v>

1398
01:06:55.921 --> 01:07:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Jonah Hill and Leo Dicaprio and I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>club owner,</v>

1399
01:07:00.271 --> 01:07:05.271
<v Speaker 2>told me to give it to a waitress and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have my way with her and I instead</v>

1400
01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:07.020
<v Speaker 2>to cut to the chase and ruin a joke.</v>

1401
01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I actually took it myself to knock </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself out,</v>

1402
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:15.050
<v Speaker 2>so because she was kind of hitting on me</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I did it too because that's kind</v>

1403
01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.570
<v Speaker 2>of guy and so all my stuff's out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't,</v>

1404
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do anything a diabolical that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can recall that roofing yourself,</v>

1405
01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:26.460
<v Speaker 2>can you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1406
01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you,</v>

1407
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:28.343
<v Speaker 2>can you add that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can recall to every single thing I </v>

1408
01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:33.570
<v Speaker 2>said on this entire interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what politicians do.</v>

1409
01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to come in and I'm going to</v>

1410
01:07:36.001 --> 01:07:39.540
<v Speaker 2>voice over this new tire interview just </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that I can recall.</v>

1411
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:40.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel we should end this either with </v>

1412
01:07:42.751 --> 01:07:45.930
<v Speaker 2>something hitting you in the nuts or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something or a song.</v>

1413
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could do a song,</v>

1414
01:07:47.161 --> 01:07:49.170
<v Speaker 2>but you already gave me the nice full </v>
<v Speaker 2>house ending.</v>

1415
01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:52.710
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is the you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were the one here with the brain.</v>

1416
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what you think is the hope of </v>
<v Speaker 2>how we can get hope is is communication.</v>

1417
01:08:02.551 --> 01:08:03.384
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That this is happening now that people </v>

1418
01:08:04.621 --> 01:08:07.110
<v Speaker 2>are doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know what I mean?</v>

1419
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Your discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fiance Kelly came across me.</v>

1420
01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:13.140
<v Speaker 2>We traded a couple messages on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1421
01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:14.003
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She gets it like she's to find some </v>

1422
01:08:15.771 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>answers.</v>

1423
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find some answers and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>went out for dinner.</v>

1424
01:08:18.741 --> 01:08:19.574
<v Speaker 1>We all became friends immediately and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people and that whatever the </v>

1425
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:25.340
<v Speaker 1>differences that we may have where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1426
01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:26.174
<v Speaker 1>you're probably still a little more left</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I am on some things and just </v>

1427
01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:29.300
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1428
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I think on some things probably you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably a little more,</v>

1429
01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:32.751
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1430
01:08:32.751 --> 01:08:33.920
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant.</v>

1431
01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I dress left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1432
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:35.953
<v Speaker 1>The accounts just doesn't even matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that the reason that </v>

1433
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:41.630
<v Speaker 1>shows like this are working is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>

1434
01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>that you were willing to come here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down to come here.</v>

1435
01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You immediately said to me that you </v>

1436
01:08:46.971 --> 01:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>wanted to come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the point.</v>

1437
01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:48.914
<v Speaker 1>It's like people want this now they they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so tired of the other thing and all </v>

1438
01:08:52.701 --> 01:08:57.701
<v Speaker 1>we're doing is exactly what Tom Snyder </v>
<v Speaker 1>did and he was just talking to a camera,</v>

1439
01:08:58.191 --> 01:08:59.024
<v Speaker 1>but what were what cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a guest or William f Buckley or </v>

1440
01:09:02.151 --> 01:09:02.984
<v Speaker 1>any of these people who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try to find some answers and you </v>

1441
01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:07.424
<v Speaker 1>can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as many answers from Bob Saget </v>

1442
01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:09.644
<v Speaker 1>as you can from the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you get far more answers from </v>

1443
01:09:12.621 --> 01:09:15.650
<v Speaker 1>listening to someone like you had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>life experience and that cares.</v>

1444
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Then you can virtually listening to cnn </v>
<v Speaker 1>all day long.</v>

1445
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Well you can get.</v>

1446
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we never got into which we don't want to</v>

1447
01:09:22.381 --> 01:09:23.214
<v Speaker 2>get into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is all the depth that I had in my </v>

1448
01:09:24.121 --> 01:09:26.130
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much death of friends.</v>

1449
01:09:26.131 --> 01:09:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I just lost someone today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about.</v>

1450
01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.850
<v Speaker 2>We can go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1451
01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:32.693
<v Speaker 2>all I was going to say was that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>centers everybody because it seems we </v>

1452
01:09:36.571 --> 01:09:37.404
<v Speaker 2>all go through our birth and death and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they all happen differently and when </v>

1453
01:09:42.121 --> 01:09:46.950
<v Speaker 2>they happen at an unfortunate age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like our last two sisters at 34 and 47,</v>

1454
01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:50.220
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what centers you.</v>

1455
01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:55.020
<v Speaker 2>That's bigger than everything is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>loss of life and when people die,</v>

1456
01:09:55.021 --> 01:09:57.780
<v Speaker 2>when young people die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing more.</v>

1457
01:09:58.050 --> 01:09:59.290
<v Speaker 2>That's all that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1458
01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:02.040
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rest of it is your belief.</v>

1459
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:05.640
<v Speaker 2>This is that this is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's yes,</v>

1460
01:10:05.641 --> 01:10:09.060
<v Speaker 2>you want to solve in a civilization how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep people alive,</v>

1461
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:10.583
<v Speaker 2>but the empathy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what's missing and just quickly to </v>

1462
01:10:16.981 --> 01:10:17.814
<v Speaker 2>touch on what we didn't touch on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we talked about before the show </v>

1463
01:10:20.161 --> 01:10:20.994
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>

1464
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:21.883
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going.</v>

1465
01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:26.700
<v Speaker 2>The talk shows that exist at night to </v>
<v Speaker 2>chat shows as they call them in England.</v>

1466
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.793
<v Speaker 2>When I would do Johnny Carson Show and </v>
<v Speaker 2>before him was Jack Paar who I got to </v>

1467
01:10:32.641 --> 01:10:33.474
<v Speaker 2>meet and before him was Steve Allen who </v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to meet and these are guys that </v>

1468
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:39.780
<v Speaker 2>they all had the tonight show those </v>
<v Speaker 2>gentlemen.</v>

1469
01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And then johnny ended up with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1470
01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:47.580
<v Speaker 2>that was viewed how they would tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>their guests,</v>

1471
01:10:47.581 --> 01:10:51.270
<v Speaker 2>you're coming to a cocktail party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I dress like a cocktail party?</v>

1472
01:10:51.271 --> 01:10:53.280
<v Speaker 2>How do I talk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're at a cocktail party,</v>

1473
01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:58.590
<v Speaker 2>you're in Johnny's living room and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharing that living room with everybody.</v>

1474
01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does he have a desk in his living?</v>

1475
01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Because he wants a desk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants a place for his ashtray.</v>

1476
01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Smokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got a little.</v>

1477
01:11:04.951 --> 01:11:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's got a drink there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever</v>

1478
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.040
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they used to do that.</v>

1479
01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of white ones.</v>

1480
01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.590
<v Speaker 1>They're smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're drinking,</v>

1481
01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:12.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burt Reynolds is.</v>

1482
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

1483
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:17.610
<v Speaker 2>And then talk about what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to see it.</v>

1484
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Although sometimes we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see some strange things that happen.</v>

1485
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of and certainly had some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1486
01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Joachim Phoenix moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those kind of things.</v>

1487
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.840
<v Speaker 2>We're still going to see more stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1488
01:11:27.841 --> 01:11:30.570
<v Speaker 2>People are going to do whatever trippy </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff they're doing.</v>

1489
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 2>But the truth of it is those late night </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows are supposed to be entertainment.</v>

1490
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:36.623
<v Speaker 2>That's what this post to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've become a bit of let's attack </v>

1491
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:45.750
<v Speaker 2>everything today that we've been through</v>
<v Speaker 2>because look what happened today because</v>

1492
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:46.703
<v Speaker 2>it's been getting ratings and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that necessarily might not do political </v>

1493
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:54.090
<v Speaker 2>comedy like James Corden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in entertainment oriented man.</v>

1494
01:11:54.091 --> 01:11:55.930
<v Speaker 2>He's been very talented men from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Broadway.</v>

1495
01:11:55.931 --> 01:11:56.764
<v Speaker 2>He's does at Carpool Karaoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He but he comes out and does a seven </v>

1496
01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:03.540
<v Speaker 2>minute monologue that might have a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff in it about the White House,</v>

1497
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:05.260
<v Speaker 2>but that's not.</v>

1498
01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:08.160
<v Speaker 2>We're not born to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what's feeding the beast,</v>

1499
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:13.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's supposed to be a time when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>chill at the end of the day where you're</v>

1500
01:12:13.021 --> 01:12:15.960
<v Speaker 2>entertain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you relax and when you want to get</v>

1501
01:12:15.961 --> 01:12:16.950
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Snyder,</v>

1502
01:12:16.951 --> 01:12:20.430
<v Speaker 2>when you want to get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dare I say the name in a sentence.</v>

1503
01:12:20.431 --> 01:12:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Charlie rose because that's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a one on one,</v>

1504
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:28.450
<v Speaker 2>but when you say a name like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't help it cause someone to recoil</v>

1505
01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:31.050
<v Speaker 2>dot Larry King for my purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry King,</v>

1506
01:12:31.051 --> 01:12:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I've known forever and I adore him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>

1507
01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Larry King.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a post to have dinner with them.</v>

1508
01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Kelly and I are supposed to go ahead </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him and Shawna on for dinner.</v>

1509
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.940
<v Speaker 2>We can go to that place if you invite </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sean,</v>

1510
01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:44.280
<v Speaker 2>that place that we went that place so we</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

1511
01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:48.420
<v Speaker 2>we don't talk about but a neat place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is quite a character.</v>

1512
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.850
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on Larry King Show,</v>

1513
01:12:50.851 --> 01:12:53.460
<v Speaker 2>he read my book and every time he sees </v>
<v Speaker 2>me he goes,</v>

1514
01:12:53.461 --> 01:12:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I loved your book second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know I'm thinking it's because he,</v>

1515
01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:01.060
<v Speaker 2>he forgot that he keeps telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's just,</v>

1516
01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.900
<v Speaker 2>I've just known him a long time and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

1517
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.400
<v Speaker 2>he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at it,</v>

1518
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:06.263
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've got some really good people </v>

1519
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:10.890
<v Speaker 2>doing the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some real good people out there.</v>

1520
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:12.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lorenzo Donald's,</v>

1521
01:13:12.241 --> 01:13:13.060
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1522
01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:13.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1523
01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:15.460
<v Speaker 2>I like them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1524
01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:20.560
<v Speaker 2>that name right there might flag people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Msnbc and uh,</v>

1525
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.860
<v Speaker 2>too many consonants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hate it,</v>

1526
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.360
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just see we need to be entertained.</v>

1527
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:30.743
<v Speaker 2>It's really complicated to do it at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>time in a way without bringing up human </v>

1528
01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.510
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral issues.</v>

1529
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.330
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to do the best I can to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1530
01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:40.081
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

1531
01:13:40.081 --> 01:13:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was never,</v>

1532
01:13:41.641 --> 01:13:43.470
<v Speaker 2>even though I think you know him </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>

1533
01:13:43.471 --> 01:13:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I was never a fan of Leno on the tonight</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1534
01:13:45.571 --> 01:13:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I loved cars and even though it was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of very early years,</v>

1535
01:13:48.331 --> 01:13:50.670
<v Speaker 2>but Leno to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always liked the bill Hicks thing or,</v>

1536
01:13:50.671 --> 01:13:51.504
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had that rival and I liked that </v>

1537
01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:56.850
<v Speaker 2>sort of more raw and gravity and Lenovo </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me was like he was just the corporate</v>

1538
01:13:56.851 --> 01:13:58.140
<v Speaker 2>version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I never liked it.</v>

1539
01:13:58.141 --> 01:14:02.820
<v Speaker 2>But in an odd way I suddenly had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre respect for him now.</v>

1540
01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:03.923
<v Speaker 2>Well he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a comedian hosting the tonight </v>

1541
01:14:05.821 --> 01:14:06.600
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1542
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.540
<v Speaker 2>And I that he wasn't overtly political </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1543
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Now it's always political and I almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>missed that</v>

1544
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.353
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he wasn't really my guy in </v>

1545
01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 1>terms of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know,</v>

1546
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I know everyone says he's incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup,</v>

1547
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.610
<v Speaker 1>which has nothing to do with his great </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup.</v>

1548
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.473
<v Speaker 1>And I was</v>

1549
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:27.500
<v Speaker 2>in turn on the Mike Douglas show within </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia at 18 years old.</v>

1550
01:14:28.451 --> 01:14:31.090
<v Speaker 2>And I was on his very first television </v>
<v Speaker 2>appearance.</v>

1551
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know Jay that long.</v>

1552
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a interesting history and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1553
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Carson,</v>

1554
01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:41.050
<v Speaker 2>David Letterman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conan,</v>

1555
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:45.670
<v Speaker 2>those were guys that I would go on those</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows and I felt the most connection.</v>

1556
01:14:45.671 --> 01:14:46.504
<v Speaker 2>But Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go on and promote a movie I'd </v>

1557
01:14:48.131 --> 01:14:48.964
<v Speaker 2>worked on that I directed that I worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>so hard and he couldn't have been more </v>

1558
01:14:51.341 --> 01:14:52.480
<v Speaker 2>gracious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1559
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.493
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to do chemo is one of the </v>

1560
01:14:56.081 --> 01:14:59.110
<v Speaker 2>sweetest people alive that does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1561
01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gold bears great.</v>

1562
01:15:01.811 --> 01:15:02.644
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting time for media and </v>

1563
01:15:04.661 --> 01:15:09.070
<v Speaker 2>for broadcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to see us get into some kind</v>

1564
01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:14.071
<v Speaker 2>of place of peace of mind in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're not there.</v>

1565
01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a big lift man.</v>

1566
01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1567
01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:20.733
<v Speaker 1>Like that's why I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you want to do this or I </v>

1568
01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:24.470
<v Speaker 1>never wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1569
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:29.760
<v Speaker 2>I've never wanted to perform more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more motivated to go do standup.</v>

1570
01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I booked these Stena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on tour.</v>

1571
01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:33.043
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to work out trying to come up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with new stuff because I know you do a </v>

1572
01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:36.250
<v Speaker 2>special on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you deplete it,</v>

1573
01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.173
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to just give them </v>

1574
01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:39.394
<v Speaker 2>something they just bought or heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people really need it and I need to </v>

1575
01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:48.811
<v Speaker 2>do it because it takes people out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It brings them into their life.</v>

1576
01:15:49.781 --> 01:15:50.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1577
01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.950
<v Speaker 1>you think like the last sense makers </v>
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>

1578
01:15:53.010 --> 01:15:54.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple others that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few.</v>

1579
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:58.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a few comedians that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather watch than almost anybody.</v>

1580
01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.133
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some good motivational </v>

1581
01:16:01.611 --> 01:16:06.140
<v Speaker 2>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some good good clergy out there.</v>

1582
01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:09.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a subscriber that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1583
01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.633
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comedian so I kind of listened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that have a lot to say and </v>

1584
01:16:15.891 --> 01:16:17.600
<v Speaker 2>some of them really do have a lot to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

1585
01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.033
<v Speaker 2>So I respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect people with a point of view </v>

1586
01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:26.060
<v Speaker 2>that aren't malicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be you.</v>

1587
01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Did we do it all here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think pretty much.</v>

1588
01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Unless you want to.</v>

1589
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:31.870
<v Speaker 1>You got to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to make some vegetables,</v>

1590
01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.053
<v Speaker 1>have a great walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I knew you had a walk me one </v>

1591
01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:35.464
<v Speaker 1>disaster story one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a nightmare I was telling you </v>

1592
01:16:38.201 --> 01:16:42.910
<v Speaker 1>before about my my thing when I was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the RNC convention and I was sweating</v>

1593
01:16:42.911 --> 01:16:45.380
<v Speaker 1>like crazy and Larry King said it's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1594
01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.713
<v Speaker 1>like Albert Brooks in broadcast news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on stage to take us out with a </v>

1595
01:16:50.381 --> 01:16:52.630
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say I get a disaster of standup,</v>

1596
01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:54.130
<v Speaker 1>but anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me some life.</v>

1597
01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1598
01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Give me a professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a life disaster.</v>

1599
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:59.420
<v Speaker 1>I gave you a life disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1600
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:02.710
<v Speaker 1>How about one life named her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dropping like disaster.</v>

1601
01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm on on an</v>

1602
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:07.530
<v Speaker 2>airplane on America on an a 7:47</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

1603
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:08.383
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the video show is number one at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time so you can then list famous </v>

1604
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:14.174
<v Speaker 2>people on the plane in the newspaper by </v>
<v Speaker 2>WHO's the most famous and how they're </v>

1605
01:17:17.421 --> 01:17:18.254
<v Speaker 2>listed in the newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was on a plane with David Bowie </v>

1606
01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:25.930
<v Speaker 2>and Amman and Greg Kinnear and Richard </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lewis.</v>

1607
01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:26.853
<v Speaker 2>Or where was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was an American flight out of JFK </v>

1608
01:17:28.881 --> 01:17:30.210
<v Speaker 2>to La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1609
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:35.290
<v Speaker 2>And also mark mckeown who was on the CBS</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning news and a friend of mine,</v>

1610
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the plane starts taking off.</v>

1611
01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:42.290
<v Speaker 2>This would never exist today as we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking off in the air.</v>

1612
01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:47.710
<v Speaker 2>We hear an explosion and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>engines apparently blows out.</v>

1613
01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.670
<v Speaker 2>The plane goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rickety.</v>

1614
01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:53.990
<v Speaker 2>We then land at JFK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a very long time ago.</v>

1615
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we find out first they take the VIP,</v>

1616
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:02.360
<v Speaker 2>which is people I named on two carts.</v>

1617
01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:05.180
<v Speaker 2>And Richard Lewis is yelling next to </v>
<v Speaker 2>David Bowie,</v>

1618
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:07.490
<v Speaker 2>only a couple of us are Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1619
01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we're in the club and I'm getting</v>

1620
01:18:12.531 --> 01:18:14.390
<v Speaker 2>to talk to David Bowie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going,</v>

1621
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was worth an explosion.</v>

1622
01:18:16.431 --> 01:18:17.264
<v Speaker 2>I'm fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who could not have been more </v>

1623
01:18:18.921 --> 01:18:22.500
<v Speaker 2>gracious and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just a,</v>

1624
01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:27.050
<v Speaker 2>it was dangerous and upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They two hours go by,</v>

1625
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.943
<v Speaker 2>they put us back on the same plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out it was a fuel hose that came </v>

1626
01:18:32.601 --> 01:18:33.434
<v Speaker 2>loose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just like turning a screw on a </v>

1627
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:38.090
<v Speaker 2>gasket on your lawnmower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they fixed it,</v>

1628
01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.013
<v Speaker 2>which would never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that would get you a new plane or </v>

1629
01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:44.320
<v Speaker 2>cancel you completely or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1630
01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:49.540
<v Speaker 2>we then took off and I made some joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the movie outbreak had just come</v>

1631
01:18:50.151 --> 01:18:53.870
<v Speaker 2>out and I said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a monkey caught in the,</v>

1632
01:18:53.871 --> 01:18:55.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the engine.</v>

1633
01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.730
<v Speaker 2>And then Richard Lewis yells out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.</v>

1634
01:18:58.731 --> 01:18:59.564
<v Speaker 2>Bob Amman is from Zaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm called out and then as we </v>

1635
01:19:06.021 --> 01:19:07.910
<v Speaker 2>take off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Lewis Yells,</v>

1636
01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:08.744
<v Speaker 2>thanks Bob to the whole plane and at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time you could go into the cockpit </v>

1637
01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:16.770
<v Speaker 2>this pre nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1638
01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I was able to ask the pilots what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

1639
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:22.910
<v Speaker 2>So I actually told the VIP [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one else.</v>

1640
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:24.240
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1641
01:19:24.241 --> 01:19:26.060
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't tell the other people.</v>

1642
01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.520
<v Speaker 2>So that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true disaster story.</v>

1643
01:19:28.521 --> 01:19:29.354
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could have ended incredibly badly </v>

1644
01:19:30.681 --> 01:19:32.060
<v Speaker 2>and I would have been fourth.</v>

1645
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:37.400
<v Speaker 2>I would put him to settle that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis because we could,</v>

1646
01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:41.120
<v Speaker 2>we could get him here and we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate some discussion last night.</v>

1647
01:19:41.121 --> 01:19:41.954
<v Speaker 2>And he and I are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He holds me by the face and hugs me and </v>

1648
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:45.643
<v Speaker 2>we're going to figure out the list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's going to tell me that I would </v>

1649
01:19:47.861 --> 01:19:50.570
<v Speaker 2>have gone ahead of him simply because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dumb video show,</v>

1650
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.830
<v Speaker 2>but he would say dumb video show in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to do it because that was probably</v>

1651
01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:56.780
<v Speaker 2>1988,</v>
<v Speaker 2>89,</v>

1652
01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:57.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the,</v>

1653
01:19:57.650 --> 01:19:58.483
<v Speaker 2>one of the nicest moments I've had on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this when I had Richard Lewis and he </v>

1654
01:20:00.261 --> 01:20:01.094
<v Speaker 2>left and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of a Germaphobe is Larry and </v>

1655
01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't shake hands.</v>

1656
01:20:04.401 --> 01:20:05.234
<v Speaker 2>He does this as he said goodbye to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked him out and when I opened up </v>

1657
01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

1658
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.580
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just said,</v>

1659
01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:10.650
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said something like,</v>

1660
01:20:10.651 --> 01:20:13.140
<v Speaker 1>you're great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he touched me on the cheek and I was</v>

1661
01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:14.580
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like melted.</v>

1662
01:20:14.581 --> 01:20:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I was living.</v>

1663
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Does this rabbinical thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what?</v>

1664
01:20:17.491 --> 01:20:18.324
<v Speaker 2>That is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Erotic rabbinical thing that I think he </v>

1665
01:20:20.161 --> 01:20:23.730
<v Speaker 2>learned from his shrink for a jury learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently shaped or the other story,</v>

1666
01:20:23.731 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 2>which is a very simple one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1667
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:26.364
<v Speaker 2>very short story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in San Francisco performing </v>

1668
01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:30.570
<v Speaker 2>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned that.</v>

1669
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Be careful what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>messing with a heckler.</v>

1670
01:20:33.650 --> 01:20:34.483
<v Speaker 2>A guy who was about eight feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got up on stage and got me in a </v>

1671
01:20:37.921 --> 01:20:38.754
<v Speaker 2>headlock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit and wouldn't let go of me and </v>

1672
01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 2>had me and it was hurting my neck badly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no security,</v>

1673
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:45.743
<v Speaker 2>nobody there days and I took the </v>
<v Speaker 2>microphone and I shoved it up his ass </v>

1674
01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:56.190
<v Speaker 2>and he got so paranoid that I had done </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1675
01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:00.000
<v Speaker 2>that he ran away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

1676
01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:04.470
<v Speaker 2>All I know is I don't know if he had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobic,</v>

1677
01:21:04.471 --> 01:21:05.304
<v Speaker 2>frightened moment or thought maybe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to go further in or maybe </v>

1678
01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:13.200
<v Speaker 2>that he would have farted and I would've</v>
<v Speaker 2>picked it up on the mic.</v>

1679
01:21:14.010 --> 01:21:14.843
<v Speaker 2>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is scary when you are out there </v>

1680
01:21:16.921 --> 01:21:19.770
<v Speaker 2>with the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now young girls will just flash me their</v>

1681
01:21:19.771 --> 01:21:21.270
<v Speaker 2>boobs and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Danny Tanner,</v>

1682
01:21:21.271 --> 01:21:22.104
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1683
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.333
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a few things like that happen </v>

1684
01:21:24.661 --> 01:21:27.990
<v Speaker 2>where people have had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>security has had to throw people out.</v>

1685
01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:28.893
<v Speaker 2>You've got all kinds of stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That won't happen to you in Irvine at </v>

1686
01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:32.700
<v Speaker 2>the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope not.</v>

1687
01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.370
<v Speaker 2>You got a hell of a standup career </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening because you have so many.</v>

1688
01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:39.000
<v Speaker 2>So you say content and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes you're going to have.</v>

1689
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:42.450
<v Speaker 2>You're going to talk philosophically </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you do on here about life,</v>

1690
01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:43.643
<v Speaker 2>and then you button it with something </v>
<v Speaker 2>humorous or you feather it throughout </v>

1691
01:21:46.561 --> 01:21:47.210
<v Speaker 2>with jokes.</v>

1692
01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1693
01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:48.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked about this a little </v>

1694
01:21:49.491 --> 01:21:49.761
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1695
01:21:49.761 --> 01:21:50.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1696
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:53.060
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways that you can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the Seinfeld way,</v>

1697
01:21:53.061 --> 01:21:56.720
<v Speaker 1>which is like that perfect tactician </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out every pause,</v>

1698
01:21:56.721 --> 01:21:59.150
<v Speaker 1>every inflection point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could never do it that way.</v>

1699
01:21:59.151 --> 01:22:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's exactly how you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it either.</v>

1700
01:22:00.831 --> 01:22:01.664
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's sort of the garry </v>

1701
01:22:02.421 --> 01:22:03.320
<v Speaker 1>shandling way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

1702
01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:04.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that great moment in the </v>

1703
01:22:04.701 --> 01:22:08.360
<v Speaker 1>documentary comedian where he shows him </v>
<v Speaker 1>his papers and it looks,</v>

1704
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:09.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler wrote it because it's like,</v>

1705
01:22:09.711 --> 01:22:11.420
<v Speaker 1>so perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1706
01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.333
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have Gary Shandling who pulls out </v>

1707
01:22:13.521 --> 01:22:16.580
<v Speaker 1>this crumbled piece of paper that's much</v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to what I am.</v>

1708
01:22:16.581 --> 01:22:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I have some ideas.</v>

1745
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very popular.</v>

1746
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.270
<v Speaker 2>So there's a goat with dynamite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A robot.</v>

1747
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not much of a robot,</v>

1748
01:24:05.801 --> 01:24:10.801
<v Speaker 2>but it's trying to exactly where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamite and you hear it.</v>

1749
01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:16.150

<v Speaker 2>Jerry's a few months older than me.</v>

1750
01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:18.400
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want Jerry.</v>

1751
01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go with dynamite.</v>

1752
01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:23.740
<v Speaker 2>And Gerry would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gerry always did,</v>

1753
01:24:23.741 --> 01:24:26.770
<v Speaker 2>was just lay out the obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>

1754
01:24:26.771 --> 01:24:29.030
<v Speaker 2>our glass with a stain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1755
01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:32.870

<v Speaker 2>he's brilliant business.</v>

1756
01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:34.630
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to clean glass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1757
01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:38.360
<v Speaker 2>but he to this day I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1758
01:24:38.361 --> 01:24:39.194
<v Speaker 2>I go with dynamite and he will laugh </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's when you know somebody and </v>

1759
01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:44.710
<v Speaker 2>you just get them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1760
01:24:44.850 --> 01:24:49.510
<v Speaker 2>And I saw a bunch of comics last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Paul Riser and it was billy crystal's</v>

1761
01:24:49.511 --> 01:24:53.110
<v Speaker 2>birthday and it's just nice seeing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that I.</v>

1762
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So magical that time.</v>

1763
01:24:56.890 --> 01:24:57.723
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you came up in a time that to me </v>

1764
01:24:58.991 --> 01:25:00.940
<v Speaker 2>and for anyone that appreciates comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1765
01:25:00.941 --> 01:25:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these guys.</v>

1766
01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.050
<v Speaker 2>And then you realize there weren't that </v>
<v Speaker 2>many.</v>

1767
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.461
<v Speaker 2>You go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1768
01:25:06.461 --> 01:25:07.840
<v Speaker 2>there were thousands of comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1769
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:08.674
<v Speaker 2>there weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were hundreds and a lot of them </v>

1770
01:25:10.931 --> 01:25:12.880
<v Speaker 2>are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>

1771
01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:15.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at that two thirds point,</v>

1772
01:25:15.401 --> 01:25:20.401
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to think my middle chapter I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means I have to live to 122.</v>

1773
01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all the medications these days,</v>

1774
01:25:22.601 --> 01:25:24.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible anything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>motorized,</v>

1775
01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:28.930
<v Speaker 2>unicycle up my butt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no seat that seems excessive,</v>

1776
01:25:28.931 --> 01:25:30.490
<v Speaker 2>but whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever works for you.</v>

1777
01:25:30.491 --> 01:25:33.850
<v Speaker 2>And we lost Stephen Hawking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wanted to end on that.</v>

1778
01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.600
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned George Wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Wallace,</v>

1779
01:25:37.601 --> 01:25:39.400
<v Speaker 2>George Wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his hbo special,</v>

1780
01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:42.400
<v Speaker 2>which I think maybe he only had one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a real disservice,</v>

1781
01:25:42.401 --> 01:25:46.240
<v Speaker 2>although he's had many other specialists</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me might be the funniest half hour.</v>

1782
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:48.820
<v Speaker 2>There was something about him and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

1783
01:25:48.821 --> 01:25:50.910
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine always rented Jerry's.</v>

<v Speaker 2>funny guy.</v>

1785
