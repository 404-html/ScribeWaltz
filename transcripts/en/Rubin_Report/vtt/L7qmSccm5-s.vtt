1
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.503
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite aspects of the Rubin </v>
<v Speaker 1>report is the feedback that we're </v>

2
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>getting from viewers literally all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Just last week I have viewers from </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries like Egypt,</v>

4
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Spain in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reach out to me just to name a few.</v>

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.073
<v Speaker 1>I'm truly humbled at so many of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the time to share your feelings </v>

7
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>with me and although I don't have time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to respond to everyone,</v>

8
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>I do try to at least read the messages </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're sending.</v>

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.643
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most amazing part of this is that </v>

10
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>the conversations we're having on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show are transcending race,</v>

11
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and nationality.</v>

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.033
<v Speaker 1>The fight for free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the importance of not giving into the </v>

13
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians and the awakening against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regressives are all ideas that bring</v>

14
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>us together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The power of ideas is universal.</v>

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>When we discuss free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free thought and free expression,</v>

16
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>it's vital that we mean it equally for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

17
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>not just in an identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics based pecking order.</v>

18
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.303
<v Speaker 1>This device,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that we all have in our </v>

19
00:00:58.171 --> 00:00:59.004
<v Speaker 1>pocket is bringing us closer together in</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that were literally unimaginable </v>

20
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>only a generation ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

21
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:05.664
<v Speaker 1>This very second one of you is watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>this direct message while on the subway </v>

22
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:09.894
<v Speaker 1>in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of you is listening to the podcast </v>

23
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:12.774
<v Speaker 1>while at the gym in London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of you is streaming this while </v>

24
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:15.894
<v Speaker 1>on your couch in Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only are you all tuning in on a </v>

25
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:19.764
<v Speaker 1>variety of platforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're furthering the discussion of </v>

26
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:22.794
<v Speaker 1>these ideas on facebook and twitter or </v>
<v Speaker 1>just by talking with your friends and </v>

27
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:26.814
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That expansion of our conversations </v>

28
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.353
<v Speaker 1>makes me want to do better work even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about difficult topics comes at </v>

29
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>both a personal and professional cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the world has gotten smaller,</v>

30
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:39.054
<v Speaker 1>it has never been more important to hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>voices that challenge our thinking and </v>

31
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>give unique perspective based on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own personal story.</v>

32
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is enough ship </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chanko.</v>

33
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>INA is the leader of the women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Movement Feminine International,</v>

34
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.533
<v Speaker 1>a columnist for the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>business times and a free speech </v>

35
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>activist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was born in Ukraine in the same year</v>

36
00:01:57.061 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>that the USSR fell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been kidnapped by the Bellaruse Kgb,</v>

37
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>and in 2013 was granted political asylum</v>
<v Speaker 1>in France.</v>

38
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.023
<v Speaker 1>She has lived a truly controversial life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and paid the price for being outspoken </v>

39
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not someone who only talks about</v>

40
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 1>the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is someone who actually lives it.</v>

41
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.753
<v Speaker 1>There are many issues I want to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 1>with INA from women's rights and free </v>

42
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>speech to Islamism and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness,</v>

43
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>but I also want to talk to her about </v>
<v Speaker 1>life in France right now.</v>

44
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Has it changed since the Paris terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks?</v>

45
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:29.484
<v Speaker 1>What's the political climate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has the regressive mentality steeped </v>

46
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.114
<v Speaker 1>into the mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus weakening free speech and helping </v>

47
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>the authoritarians.</v>

48
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.913
<v Speaker 1>The only way we can find answers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions like these is to be connected </v>

49
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>with people who aren't afraid to share </v>
<v Speaker 1>their views.</v>

50
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.233
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a catch 22 to all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>connectivity as it brings us closer and </v>

51
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:49.044
<v Speaker 1>transcends cultures and borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can also make everyone else's </v>

52
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>problems seemed like our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On one hand,</v>

53
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>we can see how others live and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>empathy for our fellow men.</v>

54
00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.153
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's hard to gauge just how </v>

55
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>much something across the globe should </v>
<v Speaker 1>affect us in our day to day lives.</v>

56
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.143
<v Speaker 1>I try to do this show each week in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of finding balance between those </v>

57
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>two concepts and I hope you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll provide perspective on some of the</v>

58
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.004
<v Speaker 1>big questions I've mentioned here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more we focus on our common </v>

59
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:18.904
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less chance we'll be able to be </v>

60
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:21.604
<v Speaker 1>ripped apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initiative Chanko is the leader of the </v>

61
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>International Women's movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feminine,</v>

62
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a speaker,</v>

63
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>and a fearless free speech advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.153
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the show.</v>

65
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.931
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

66
00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for invitation for long I </v>
<v Speaker 2>should say.</v>

67
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really glad that we connected.</v>

68
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:41.094
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known about your work for awhile </v>

69
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.983
<v Speaker 1>and then I saw a piece that you wrote in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the International Business Times last </v>

70
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.780
<v Speaker 1>week about the regressive left and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist right.</v>

71
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>And that basically most of us are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between and that's very much what,</v>

72
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.880
<v Speaker 1>what we've been talking about here on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this show.</v>

73
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:56.250
<v Speaker 1>So I thought it would be a perfect time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to you.</v>

74
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:57.810
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in Austria right now,</v>

75
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:00.110
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right now in Australia.</v>

76
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.240
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask what you're doing there?</v>

77
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Or is this a top secret mission?</v>

78
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

79
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.893
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for a conference about free </v>

80
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:09.164
<v Speaker 2>speech of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that this time it will not be </v>

81
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:12.044
<v Speaker 2>interrupted by a terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will be speaking and enjoy this </v>

82
00:04:16.761 --> 00:04:18.260
<v Speaker 2>topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Discussing this topic.</v>

83
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.173
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're going to talk about some of </v>

84
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:20.734
<v Speaker 1>the interruptions that you've had a by </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists when you're giving talks on </v>

85
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:25.174
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But first let's do a little bit on your </v>

86
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 1>biography because I think it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

87
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned at the top of the show you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were born in Ukraine,</v>

88
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.364
<v Speaker 1>not the Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were born in Ukraine the same year </v>

89
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 1>that the Soviet Union fell and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had a lot to do with sort of your,</v>

90
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.523
<v Speaker 1>your path right now because of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you saw in a sort of newborn </v>

91
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.124
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you talk a little bit about your </v>

92
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:46.894
<v Speaker 1>history first?</v>

93
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.573
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born the year my country was born </v>

94
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

95
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 2>of course the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.190
<v Speaker 2>for me as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it was just,</v>

97
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.083
<v Speaker 2>just a childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for adults it was of course a rough </v>

98
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:02.404
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then later I understood that I had a </v>

99
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 2>rough childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

100
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to make a homework under the </v>

101
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:09.814
<v Speaker 2>candles because all our electricity in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the city was shot for the sake of the </v>

102
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

103
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have a national currency.</v>

104
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:21.450
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

105
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.460
<v Speaker 2>my parents were a receiving salary with </v>
<v Speaker 2>sausages or was breads,</v>

106
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

107
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

108
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 2>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm powered to a spot that,</v>

109
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

110
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:39.560
<v Speaker 2>I think that this is not something </v>
<v Speaker 2>special for yeah to,</v>

111
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.300
<v Speaker 2>to tell you about because still until </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

112
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.370
<v Speaker 2>many people live in poverty and 25 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>after Ukraine,</v>

113
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.473
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually right now in a similar </v>

114
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 2>situation and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 2>already my nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a small child who is eight years old,</v>

116
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:57.724
<v Speaker 2>he near in this similar situation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>has similar childhood to what I had so </v>

117
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 2>situation is that really changing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressing.</v>

118
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.210
<v Speaker 2>But of course it had a really a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact on me.</v>

119
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:11.051
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

120
00:06:11.051 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I think when the old generation that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>born after the collapse of the USSR,</v>

121
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 2>because we saw what we saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

122
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as adults,</v>

123
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:25.720
<v Speaker 2>we're saying our country was ruled by </v>
<v Speaker 2>450 idiots.</v>

124
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm quoting particularly,</v>

125
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandma and my mother,</v>

126
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 2>they were calling them all adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're calling politicians always,</v>

127
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was always this clear gap between </v>

128
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:41.921
<v Speaker 2>society and those 450 Egypt's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they say.</v>

129
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.263
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was always a gambit between </v>

130
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 2>government and citizens and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

131
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you as a child,</v>

132
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I never could imagine that it could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>any connection between those people,</v>

133
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:58.410
<v Speaker 2>between this small group of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we could call one percent and 99 percent</v>

134
00:06:58.411 --> 00:06:59.244
<v Speaker 2>of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was all this an impression as if </v>

135
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 2>we were living in different countries.</v>

136
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

137
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:06.434
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a very traditional society </v>

138
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:14.981
<v Speaker 2>where woman has to work and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well to have job and also of course take</v>

139
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:16.844
<v Speaker 2>care of everything at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even though my father was not a </v>

140
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.443
<v Speaker 2>particular patriarch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course all the while my mother </v>

141
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:24.900
<v Speaker 2>was a housewife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

142
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 2>as well as I'm working full time and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>

143
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during,</v>

144
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 2>well during this time of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 2>trying to create a government in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

146
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:41.450
<v Speaker 2>have to collapse a few ceasar parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to work on different jobs and uh,</v>

147
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother was working on three different</v>

148
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 2>jobs and of course taking care of us at </v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

149
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 2>which of course gave an impression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

150
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 2>and kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.183
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to paint a picture of what woman </v>

152
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 2>is supposed to do and what her mission </v>
<v Speaker 2>is and what men is supposed to do.</v>

153
00:07:58.641 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 2>And even in such a hard economically </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

154
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.903
<v Speaker 2>my father was of course earning much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and had access to more jobs and </v>

155
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have possibility to find different</v>

156
00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More interesting than my mother.</v>

157
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.273
<v Speaker 1>Women really were doing two jobs because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were working and they were taking </v>

158
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:18.770
<v Speaker 1>care of the home and the kids and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

159
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

160
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

161
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.063
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's incorrect to speak in the </v>

162
00:08:22.391 --> 00:08:23.224
<v Speaker 2>past because as I already decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remains the realities still a exactly </v>

163
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:30.790
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe sometimes we have an illusion,</v>

164
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:31.624
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expect in a different cover and we can </v>

165
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:37.150
<v Speaker 2>see more women who do not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

166
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.090
<v Speaker 2>still a majority of women live that </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

167
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:44.590
<v Speaker 2>And My mother's still continues to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>in two different jobs today.</v>

168
00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well she doesn't have children anymore.</v>

169
00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:47.764
<v Speaker 2>We're going.</v>

170
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.273
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think you think there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong with that in and of </v>

171
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:52.334
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just sort of want people to </v>

172
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge the role of the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

173
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.480
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think</v>

174
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.060
<v Speaker 1>well that they're doing that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing both these things that they,</v>

175
00:09:02.061 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad to take care of your kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and of itself,</v>

176
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:06.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

177
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too bad to take care of your kids.</v>

178
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 2>But it's bad if you're the only one this</v>
<v Speaker 2>post to take care of your kid.</v>

179
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

180
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.990
<v Speaker 1>So the role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role.</v>

181
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:14.641
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

182
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 2>exactly that you have to follow the role</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have no choice.</v>

183
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.300
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

184
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

185
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong in this,</v>

186
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:26.520
<v Speaker 2>in this concept and in this reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And therefore,</v>

187
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

188
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 2>we started a movement in Ukraine as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>women's movement,</v>

189
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.353
<v Speaker 2>feminist movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though at the beginning I should </v>

190
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:36.174
<v Speaker 2>confess when we started our activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't really have a clear </v>

191
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 2>understanding what feminism was about </v>
<v Speaker 2>because for example,</v>

192
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:44.030
<v Speaker 2>to give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

193
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give you an example,</v>

194
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I was studying in the Best University of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine.</v>

195
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I was studying journalism and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four years of my studies,</v>

196
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I never had it been even one hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture on what feminism is.</v>

197
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.733
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even hear the definition of </v>

198
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:00.324
<v Speaker 2>sanctuary ideology because that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something which is not close to Eastern </v>

199
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.933
<v Speaker 2>European society again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where women have to be at home and take </v>

200
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 2>care of who have family but not go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>street and demand their rights.</v>

201
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.593
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually it's not concerning only </v>

202
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.263
<v Speaker 2>women's rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally I grew up in the country </v>

203
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:25.731
<v Speaker 2>where people do not until 2008 and 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

204
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment of orange revolution.</v>

205
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 2>The first revolution that happened in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of independent Ukraine.</v>

206
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Until that moment people didn't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

207
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protest was a,</v>

208
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an activity of a bad taste,</v>

209
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was something that you wouldn't do.</v>

210
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.220
<v Speaker 2>It was something that you would do only </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

211
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably earn money because </v>
<v Speaker 2>political parties in Ukraine pay you for</v>

212
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm sending was the flags in the streets</v>
<v Speaker 2>and protesting supporting one or another</v>

213
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.713
<v Speaker 2>politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we started our activity we were </v>

214
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.403
<v Speaker 2>of course accused accused for being paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>by someone and being political project </v>

215
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:06.923
<v Speaker 2>or also being named by our parents or </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatives who knew that we don't get </v>

216
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 2>money for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just simply named either witches</v>

217
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.760
<v Speaker 2>or psychologically sick girls.</v>

218
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.461
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

219
00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:20.590
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to jump too far ahead </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

220
00:11:20.591 --> 00:11:21.760
<v Speaker 1>So we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go into.</v>

221
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.623
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go into all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just to sort of wrap up the Ukraine </v>

222
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:25.840
<v Speaker 1>part because I think a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:11:25.841 --> 00:11:28.360
<v Speaker 1>there's so much happening with Ukraine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you said,</v>

224
00:11:28.361 --> 00:11:29.194
<v Speaker 1>it is a young country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only 25 years old in terms of </v>

225
00:11:31.811 --> 00:11:32.644
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of what's happening in </v>

226
00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it,</v>

227
00:11:36.341 --> 00:11:41.080
<v Speaker 1>it sort of seems like the quest for true</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence in a way has failed because</v>

228
00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Russia is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is back in Ukraine.</v>

229
00:11:43.421 --> 00:11:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it,</v>

230
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.663
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like you're part that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine is really an independent state </v>

231
00:11:48.221 --> 00:11:49.054
<v Speaker 1>at this point?</v>

232
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.583
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine is an independent state and I </v>

233
00:11:51.941 --> 00:11:54.580
<v Speaker 2>think that nobody should it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

234
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course putting questions in Russia is</v>

235
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:58.100
<v Speaker 2>questioning it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

236
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Ukraine is an independent state,</v>

237
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though our territory,</v>

238
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 2>we're already taking an occupied like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Crimea,</v>

239
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.253
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work presently occupied in Ukraine last </v>

240
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.883
<v Speaker 2>right now and still there is the eastern</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of Ukraine occupied by a Russian </v>

241
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:19.260
<v Speaker 2>military troops and I will say bravely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

242
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I will claim that their Russian troops </v>
<v Speaker 2>as it was proven,</v>

243
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

244
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.153
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine is an independent state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is definitely at the stage of its </v>

245
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 2>development and creation and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

246
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:35.791
<v Speaker 2>choosing the path a while 99 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>population today,</v>

247
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:37.710
<v Speaker 2>a screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

248
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.720
<v Speaker 2>for your integration and for wish to </v>
<v Speaker 2>join European Union or a dream because I</v>

249
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 2>think it's quite a remote possibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

250
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is still,</v>

251
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the garments,</v>

252
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 2>the one that I mentioned about 450 </v>
<v Speaker 2>agents remain.</v>

253
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 2>They remain those people because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

254
00:12:58.241 --> 00:13:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I should say that the problem of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

255
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.680
<v Speaker 2>what my country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country where I was born,</v>

256
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.903
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't feel like I have a </v>

257
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.330
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

258
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that the problem of this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a,</v>

259
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.720
<v Speaker 2>for 25 years at least I observed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same faces in the parliament.</v>

260
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I hear the same names of politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the country is ruled by the same.</v>

261
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 2>If you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

262
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.490
<v Speaker 2>methia oligarch who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unions fractions,</v>

263
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.370
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today's President Poroshenko,</v>

264
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.470
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

265
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.140
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be and he claims to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one who is for your integration.</v>

266
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:38.224
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a minister of foreign affairs in </v>

267
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:41.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

268
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 2>cabinets in a parliament of President </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yanukovych who was recently the dictator</v>

269
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:51.991
<v Speaker 2>against who people went out recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the square in my down and key up.</v>

270
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:52.984
<v Speaker 2>So definitely I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say that this sort of </v>

271
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:56.020
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

272
00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

273
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually unfair and wrong to think</v>

274
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:01.894
<v Speaker 2>that after people go out and destroy the</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution is when people go out on the </v>

275
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:06.461
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

276
00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:08.110
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's beginning of it.</v>

277
00:14:08.111 --> 00:14:08.944
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's beginning of the protests and I </v>

278
00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:11.284
<v Speaker 2>think that the protests started in 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first orange revolution 10 years </v>

279
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 2>after people again went out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street because the changes didn't happen</v>

280
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

281
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>many people are deceived because don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>see rapid changes.</v>

282
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:24.873
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

283
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a mistaken and wrong to </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect changes right away.</v>

284
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that Ukraine will have to.</v>

285
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.630
<v Speaker 2>We'll have to have few more revolutions.</v>

286
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So speaking of that,</v>

287
00:14:36.321 --> 00:14:37.160
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think,</v>

288
00:14:37.161 --> 00:14:37.994
<v Speaker 1>what does the average person in Ukraine </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel about how the rest of the world </v>

289
00:14:41.961 --> 00:14:42.794
<v Speaker 1>views them now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I sensed that the people of </v>

290
00:14:44.841 --> 00:14:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine want more help from the west and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

291
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America we talk about it,</v>

292
00:14:49.851 --> 00:14:50.684
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about it for like the two </v>

293
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 1>weeks that Putin was moving troops in or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

294
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:54.944
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a two week window where we </v>

295
00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 1>talk about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

296
00:14:57.861 --> 00:14:58.694
<v Speaker 1>we just completely forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a disappointment on behalf of </v>

297
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:02.384
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of how the world has reacted to </v>

298
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:05.444
<v Speaker 1>what's happened there?</v>

299
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:06.821
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

300
00:15:06.821 --> 00:15:08.890
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a disappointment because,</v>

301
00:15:08.891 --> 00:15:09.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

302
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.533
<v Speaker 2>people feel that people know that their </v>
<v Speaker 2>government is actually unable to do </v>

303
00:15:16.091 --> 00:15:19.180
<v Speaker 2>something to change thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And since people give,</v>

304
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.043
<v Speaker 2>you know from this square and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were giving the messages to the </v>

305
00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:24.094
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they do expect from other </v>

306
00:15:26.501 --> 00:15:29.830
<v Speaker 2>states the more powerful or so called </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic,</v>

307
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:30.873
<v Speaker 2>who already reached a certain level who </v>
<v Speaker 2>could help and support and especially </v>

308
00:15:35.711 --> 00:15:40.711
<v Speaker 2>those who support it verbally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do not support support practically.</v>

309
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.221
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

310
00:15:42.221 --> 00:15:43.960
<v Speaker 2>many people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

311
00:15:43.961 --> 00:15:44.794
<v Speaker 2>deceived and disappointed today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even some come to the point when </v>

312
00:15:48.851 --> 00:15:52.480
<v Speaker 2>they say that a younger core image was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dictator,</v>

313
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.750
<v Speaker 2>it was better because at least what to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>

314
00:15:55.751 --> 00:15:57.850
<v Speaker 2>And he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his government didn't touch.</v>

315
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

316
00:15:58.821 --> 00:15:59.654
<v Speaker 1>so last thought on this and then we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna move on to some of the feminism </v>

317
00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:02.781
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

318
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

319
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:05.264
<v Speaker 1>but I think didn't Ukraine have nukes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they gave up as part of that they </v>

320
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:13.340
<v Speaker 1>would get NATO protection once they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>an independent nation and basically that</v>

321
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 1>just didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

322
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.703
<v Speaker 1>So they sort of gave up their protection</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the weapons that would have </v>

323
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:21.830
<v Speaker 1>protected them and then they get this </v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion or whatever you want to call it</v>

324
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:25.550
<v Speaker 1>from Russia and now the other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there doing nothing.</v>

325
00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 1>We're doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

326
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.000
<v Speaker 1>it was really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

327
00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 1>an unfortunate decision I suppose.</v>

328
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

329
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

330
00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 2>if we will go right now in discussing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a decision or NATO,</v>

331
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it will be too complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

332
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or because,</v>

333
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.093
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there are a lot of sides of this </v>

334
00:16:43.411 --> 00:16:44.244
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

335
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.770
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

336
00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

337
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:47.624
<v Speaker 2>many people today thinking back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that what kind of mistakes we're </v>

338
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:52.094
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at that moment it seemed to be very </v>

339
00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:57.560
<v Speaker 2>correct to a decision because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

340
00:16:57.561 --> 00:16:58.394
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody could expect that Putin suddenly </v>

341
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.423
<v Speaker 2>I'm decides to occupy the territory is </v>
<v Speaker 2>proved the world that he's even bigger </v>

342
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.660
<v Speaker 2>dictator then into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perceive him.</v>

343
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.291
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

344
00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I know we can talk about that political </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff forever.</v>

345
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:12.104
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's move on to this stuff that you're </v>

346
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 1>really passionate about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny because at the top of the</v>

347
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:17.474
<v Speaker 1>show I do my direct message where I give</v>
<v Speaker 1>my feelings of the week and I wrote my </v>

348
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.080
<v Speaker 1>little piece about it yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then right after I wrote it,</v>

349
00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:24.914
<v Speaker 1>I watched your Ted talk and basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>your Ted talk was a 20 minute sort of </v>

350
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.320
<v Speaker 1>much broader version of exactly what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to write about yesterday by,</v>

351
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.290
<v Speaker 1>by total coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that the things that you talk</v>

352
00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:37.124
<v Speaker 1>about are the things that I'm incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate about and that I've made the </v>

353
00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:41.240
<v Speaker 1>show that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you had a great quote in your,</v>

354
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:42.074
<v Speaker 1>in your Ted Talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that feminine is a movement </v>

355
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 1>that is trying to rebuild society </v>
<v Speaker 1>without permission.</v>

356
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.483
<v Speaker 1>I love that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you just expand on that a little </v>

357
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:53.124
<v Speaker 1>bit and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made you start feminine and where </v>

358
00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:55.674
<v Speaker 1>do you think it's going?</v>

359
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly by that statement,</v>

360
00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:03.351
<v Speaker 2>I should say that anyone who is dreaming</v>
<v Speaker 2>to rebuild the world should come.</v>

361
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:04.764
<v Speaker 2>That you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should not ask for permission </v>

362
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:11.361
<v Speaker 2>because nobody will ever give it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you dream to change something,</v>

363
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:12.264
<v Speaker 2>you should not ask for permission or </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight when someone will give you that </v>

364
00:18:16.251 --> 00:18:16.540
<v Speaker 2>impression</v>

365
00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.600
<v Speaker 1>waiting a long time.</v>

366
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it will never happen.</v>

367
00:18:20.031 --> 00:18:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

368
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ukraine as,</v>

369
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.633
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started in Ukraine a movement in </v>

370
00:18:25.701 --> 00:18:30.030
<v Speaker 2>2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm aware existed movement already exist</v>

371
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:34.610
<v Speaker 2>for eight years and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say that's the one we started.</v>

372
00:18:34.611 --> 00:18:35.444
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have any particular knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>of political knowledge or didn't know </v>

373
00:18:41.091 --> 00:18:44.720
<v Speaker 2>how to work with media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you already did that.</v>

374
00:18:44.721 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 2>We didn't really have a clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

375
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.690
<v Speaker 2>understanding what feminism is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

376
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.800
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

377
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:52.693
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel embarrassed or shy to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that because I think that this </v>

378
00:18:56.031 --> 00:19:00.560
<v Speaker 2>should show and reflect the society in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which we were growing up.</v>

379
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:01.723
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember joining this little group </v>

380
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.540
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which nobody knew at that moment yet.</v>

381
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were when we had the meeting in a </v>

382
00:19:12.441 --> 00:19:15.460
<v Speaker 2>very Soviet style cafe in the center of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kiev,</v>

383
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.300
<v Speaker 2>sharing two cups of tea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a on 50 for 15 of us because we were all</v>

384
00:19:20.301 --> 00:19:25.190
<v Speaker 2>young students coming from small cities </v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep dreaming that this will be the,</v>

385
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.453
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place where we will have is women </v>

386
00:19:27.621 --> 00:19:28.400
<v Speaker 2>opportunities.</v>

387
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.780
<v Speaker 2>And the only opportunities we will </v>
<v Speaker 2>propose even in this big city in capital</v>

388
00:19:32.781 --> 00:19:34.260
<v Speaker 2>that looked for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

389
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.900
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous,</v>

390
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

391
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

392
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.800
<v Speaker 2>we only had the opportunity as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar to those that I saw,</v>

393
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:43.773
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opportunities that women had in my </v>

394
00:19:45.621 --> 00:19:46.401
<v Speaker 2>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

395
00:19:46.401 --> 00:19:48.860
<v Speaker 2>to serve someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

396
00:19:48.861 --> 00:19:50.980
<v Speaker 2>very often Ukrainian women are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

397
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.000
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

398
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.190
<v Speaker 2>mainly claim that they are beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is true,</v>

399
00:19:55.191 --> 00:20:00.191
<v Speaker 2>they're not educated and poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this becomes a reason to involve,</v>

400
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.710
<v Speaker 2>usually involve women in sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploitation,</v>

401
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.270
<v Speaker 2>prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

402
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:06.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

403
00:20:06.591 --> 00:20:09.510
<v Speaker 2>on my way to university everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

404
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I could be here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

405
00:20:11.661 --> 00:20:15.040
<v Speaker 2>harassed second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>received many flyers,</v>

406
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

407
00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:19.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what pimps or brothers who would propose</v>

408
00:20:19.521 --> 00:20:24.521
<v Speaker 2>you to go to work and many women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many girls did a goal and you know,</v>

409
00:20:25.251 --> 00:20:26.084
<v Speaker 2>applied for such a job because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have other disabilities because you're </v>

410
00:20:29.421 --> 00:20:30.770
<v Speaker 2>not horrible than anything else.</v>

411
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:35.770
<v Speaker 2>So for us to first reason to start the </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity was to fight this disease,</v>

412
00:20:35.931 --> 00:20:40.090
<v Speaker 2>this illness of Eastern Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

413
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.790
<v Speaker 2>considering women as sex slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this prostitute.</v>

414
00:20:42.791 --> 00:20:45.770
<v Speaker 2>And we were campaigning against </v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitution and sex tourism,</v>

415
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:51.070
<v Speaker 2>which is a really widespread disease in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine particularly.</v>

416
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.533
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were competing against that </v>

417
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.300
<v Speaker 2>wearing pink clothes and carrying pink </v>
<v Speaker 2>balloons and pink flags,</v>

418
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:01.680
<v Speaker 2>believing that was this pink color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will attract attention to,</v>

419
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this problem.</v>

420
00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course we failed and,</v>

421
00:21:05.081 --> 00:21:05.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

422
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:10.981
<v Speaker 2>organizing protests with hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 female activists and nobody was even</v>

423
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 2>stopping when they were passing by to </v>
<v Speaker 2>read our banners.</v>

424
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:16.991
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

425
00:21:16.991 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 2>we were in search of tactics of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>waste,</v>

426
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:24.360
<v Speaker 2>how we can attract attention of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>very political.</v>

427
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

428
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:30.661
<v Speaker 2>desperate society to something very </v>
<v Speaker 2>essential to the rights of women,</v>

429
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 2>something that the whole world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>already talking about,</v>

430
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Speaker 2>accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing,</v>

431
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:36.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopting laws.</v>

432
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

433
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.221
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

434
00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:40.970
<v Speaker 2>for two years we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

435
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.730
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in desperate search and uh,</v>

436
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.943
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2010 we saw that the situation in </v>

437
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine was changing because I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictator,</v>

438
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.503
<v Speaker 2>which we understood later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dictator Yanukovych was elected as a </v>

439
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:56.044
<v Speaker 2>president and distribution was changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could immediately feel the sends </v>

440
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.753
<v Speaker 2>ship in media could immediately feel the</v>
<v Speaker 2>change of political situation and the </v>

441
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:08.370
<v Speaker 2>more than the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we understood that,</v>

442
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.223
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll probably have to go as a female </v>

443
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:11.914
<v Speaker 2>activist as a female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Voices would probably have to complain </v>

444
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.920
<v Speaker 2>about something broader or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that brings us to this problem,</v>

445
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:21.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more limited problems such as </v>

446
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.680
<v Speaker 2>prostitution and sex tourism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

447
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.330
<v Speaker 2>something that is to the root of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

448
00:22:28.331 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 2>the political situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economical situation,</v>

449
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.940
<v Speaker 2>those people who bring the society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

450
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.650
<v Speaker 2>in such state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we did our first topless projects,</v>

451
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 2>2010,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest.</v>

452
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:41.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was more,</v>

453
00:22:41.921 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 2>as an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was also sort of a scream from inside</v>

454
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:52.170
<v Speaker 2>and as I said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a decision made during this,</v>

455
00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in a very,</v>

456
00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.173
<v Speaker 2>in a desperate search of how to let </v>
<v Speaker 2>people hear women's voices and their </v>

457
00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.383
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

458
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:05.180
<v Speaker 1>How did that first moment feel for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you did the topless protest?</v>

459
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.023
<v Speaker 1>Because you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it hadn't picked up much </v>

460
00:23:07.311 --> 00:23:09.710
<v Speaker 1>traction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were already talking about things as</v>

461
00:23:09.711 --> 00:23:12.470
<v Speaker 1>you've said that we're sort of not </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted in society.</v>

462
00:23:12.471 --> 00:23:13.850
<v Speaker 1>So you're already going against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grain,</v>

463
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.571
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

464
00:23:14.571 --> 00:23:15.620
<v Speaker 1>you realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

465
00:23:15.621 --> 00:23:18.950
<v Speaker 1>we've got to do something that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to really get us publicity the right way</v>

466
00:23:18.951 --> 00:23:21.410
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did literally that first moment when</v>

467
00:23:21.411 --> 00:23:22.940
<v Speaker 1>you took off your top feel?</v>

468
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:23.933
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say that I didn't do that that </v>

469
00:23:26.011 --> 00:23:31.011
<v Speaker 2>moment because I did it a year after </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we had a huge discussion in the,</v>

470
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.970
<v Speaker 2>in the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

471
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:33.863
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of in the fights about whether to </v>

472
00:23:35.551 --> 00:23:36.740
<v Speaker 2>do it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

473
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because so,</v>

474
00:23:39.391 --> 00:23:42.330
<v Speaker 2>and I was one of those who were against </v>
<v Speaker 2>topless protests,</v>

475
00:23:42.331 --> 00:23:43.164
<v Speaker 2>so that came later for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm definitely had a huge effect </v>

476
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:51.050
<v Speaker 2>because we have now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we not only had the unpopular speech,</v>

477
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:54.170
<v Speaker 2>but we also use them very unpopular </v>
<v Speaker 2>tactic.</v>

478
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.070
<v Speaker 2>We were showing something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any job,</v>

479
00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:57.923
<v Speaker 2>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very important to learn this </v>

480
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:00.614
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The image of a woman which was popular </v>

481
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:04.850
<v Speaker 2>in Ukraine was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

482
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:06.200
<v Speaker 2>a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smiling,</v>

483
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:08.540
<v Speaker 2>sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cleaning lady.</v>

484
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.623
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so we were showing a screaming and </v>

485
00:24:12.431 --> 00:24:13.264
<v Speaker 2>grape bare breasted woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the message was slogan written </v>

486
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:18.500
<v Speaker 2>across her chest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

487
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 2>which was something that was breaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely the definition,</v>

488
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:22.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

489
00:24:22.901 --> 00:24:23.631
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

490
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:24.464
<v Speaker 2>the definition or imagination that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contexts in which people could see that </v>

491
00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 2>the woman and the definition of woman in</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally in Ukraine.</v>

492
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.710
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it was a,</v>

493
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.563
<v Speaker 2>it attracted a lot of attention or </v>
<v Speaker 2>different attention as well as some </v>

494
00:24:40.221 --> 00:24:42.410
<v Speaker 2>support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is support from Ukraine.</v>

495
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:44.080
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

496
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.760
<v Speaker 2>we felt a huge support from abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

497
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.800
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

498
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:51.703
<v Speaker 2>of course we would have been named a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitutes immediately because we were </v>

499
00:24:54.501 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 2>naked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again revealed something that,</v>

500
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people,</v>

501
00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:03.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>naked woman is equal to prostitutes.</v>

502
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:04.603
<v Speaker 2>And I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say that it was this topless </v>

503
00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 2>project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we are reaching,</v>

504
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 2>I think that we're committing sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>test for democracy.</v>

505
00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.650
<v Speaker 2>We commit a test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we test the society and uh,</v>

506
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:16.873
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this tactic was the messages and </v>

507
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.860
<v Speaker 2>speeches that we have with test society </v>
<v Speaker 2>and will reveal a lot.</v>

508
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we reveal a lot on the reaction on those</v>

509
00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:31.280
<v Speaker 2>projects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I should say that what we actually do</v>

510
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:32.114
<v Speaker 2>very often people say feminine are </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent because we are aggressive </v>

511
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 2>because we're screaming.</v>

512
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.793
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which immediately makes the fear that </v>

513
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:41.120
<v Speaker 2>for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

514
00:25:41.121 --> 00:25:45.440
<v Speaker 2>a woman who is angry is the violence is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something violent.</v>

515
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.260
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find to see angry men,</v>

516
00:25:48.261 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 2>but with women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not smiling or keeping silent,</v>

517
00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:54.080
<v Speaker 2>but who's screaming is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent.</v>

518
00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:54.914
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a we probably killed were probably </v>

519
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.770
<v Speaker 2>feeling some people buy our messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

520
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course literally we do not harm.</v>

521
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:11.170
<v Speaker 2>We do not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do not interact,</v>

522
00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't touch anyone physically.</v>

523
00:26:15.441 --> 00:26:19.580
<v Speaker 2>We can touch and attack ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We buy our ideas,</v>

524
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:23.660
<v Speaker 2>but what actually do is we appear take </v>
<v Speaker 2>off our top and strip.</v>

525
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Our ID is written and our buddies we </v>
<v Speaker 2>create.</v>

526
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.960
<v Speaker 2>I think that we transform our bodies in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the political messages,</v>

527
00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:33.200
<v Speaker 2>in our manifesto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in posters if you want this.</v>

528
00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.230
<v Speaker 2>These are posters on which we write our </v>
<v Speaker 2>slogans.</v>

529
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.350
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this way we,</v>

530
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

531
00:26:39.921 --> 00:26:44.550
<v Speaker 2>there are a few functions because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first function of course is to provoke,</v>

532
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.780
<v Speaker 2>to attract attention.</v>

533
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Second is that we change the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what naked budget it is.</v>

534
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.550
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so many.</v>

535
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.833
<v Speaker 2>You can see women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>naked women everywhere on covers of </v>

536
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 2>magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on billboards.</v>

537
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.710
<v Speaker 2>They opposing smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexy.</v>

538
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.550
<v Speaker 2>What we're showing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're showing woman who's not sexy,</v>

539
00:27:05.551 --> 00:27:06.640
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

540
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.270
<v Speaker 2>she's political her by this political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not smiling,</v>

541
00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:14.271
<v Speaker 2>she's screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not inviting you to use her.</v>

542
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.430
<v Speaker 2>She's refusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is showing her anger.</v>

543
00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:19.560
<v Speaker 2>She's showing that she's demanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

544
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.570
<v Speaker 2>And of course this is something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks a lot of stereotypes and rules.</v>

545
00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:25.404
<v Speaker 2>And traditions in particularly in </v>
<v Speaker 2>society like Ukraine have generally in </v>

546
00:27:30.121 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 2>many countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we received a very different reaction of</v>

547
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.400
<v Speaker 2>such protests and I think it reveals a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

548
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:36.570
<v Speaker 2>It mirrors a lot.</v>

549
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:37.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is you're really </v>

550
00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:43.170
<v Speaker 1>talking about the true roots of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminism really is.</v>

551
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 1>You are demanding to be accepted as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute equal to a man,</v>

552
00:27:47.641 --> 00:27:52.380
<v Speaker 1>which really is what you first wave </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminism here in the west was.</v>

553
00:27:52.381 --> 00:27:55.140
<v Speaker 1>It's now changed and morphed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

554
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.260
<v Speaker 1>But all you're demanding sort of is </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality.</v>

555
00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.393
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you described as a sex </v>

556
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.760
<v Speaker 1>streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you like that word?</v>

557
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've used that word a little bit,</v>

558
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:06.720
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard it about you more.</v>

559
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:09.403
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is the word that we created </v>

560
00:28:12.371 --> 00:28:13.450
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're done.</v>

561
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.450
<v Speaker 2>It defines itself is sex drummist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

562
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.313
<v Speaker 2>because we use our sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we have female as our </v>

563
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:23.240
<v Speaker 2>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our God is our weapons.</v>

564
00:28:23.241 --> 00:28:24.074
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is also sort of a not </v>
<v Speaker 2>unser to fundamentalist terrorists who </v>

565
00:28:28.191 --> 00:28:31.580
<v Speaker 2>use the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who actually killed people.</v>

566
00:28:31.581 --> 00:28:34.060
<v Speaker 2>We showed them our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddies,</v>

567
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.810
<v Speaker 2>my weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because first of all,</v>

568
00:28:35.811 --> 00:28:39.320
<v Speaker 2>you are scared of it as if it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a weapon who,</v>

569
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.263
<v Speaker 2>which could kill you in a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see that this budget really can </v>

570
00:28:44.451 --> 00:28:46.580
<v Speaker 2>destroy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

571
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can destroy bad ideas or at least </v>

572
00:28:49.971 --> 00:28:52.910
<v Speaker 2>challenge them or provoke them a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>

573
00:28:52.911 --> 00:28:53.744
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it ourselves is because we use </v>

574
00:28:56.331 --> 00:28:59.090
<v Speaker 2>our sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex as a weapon,</v>

575
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.410
<v Speaker 2>our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our weapon.</v>

576
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.493
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as I mentioned at the top of the </v>

577
00:29:02.341 --> 00:29:04.170
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you've illustrated here,</v>

578
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.243
<v Speaker 1>quite obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that you talk about these </v>

579
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:08.304
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you literally are putting your life </v>

580
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:10.704
<v Speaker 1>on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

581
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.430
<v Speaker 1>just by taking your shirt off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of people who you've angered,</v>

582
00:29:14.431 --> 00:29:15.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible.</v>

583
00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:16.344
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you've also had very close brushes </v>

584
00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:22.110
<v Speaker 1>with the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with actual terrorism and violence.</v>

585
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Can you go into a couple examples of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>KGB example in boundaries and just,</v>

586
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:28.380
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were literally an event that you</v>

587
00:29:28.381 --> 00:29:30.750
<v Speaker 1>were speaking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech was shot up.</v>

588
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's some crazy audio of that.</v>

589
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Can you just talk about those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples?</v>

590
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:36.751
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

591
00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:40.440
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is what I was talking about</v>

592
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.740
<v Speaker 2>that will reveal a lot of things with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this protest,</v>

593
00:29:43.741 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 2>but to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't expect that we will,</v>

594
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just topless woman was the worst written</v>

595
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:51.220
<v Speaker 2>across the chest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could um,</v>

596
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could invite the garments and secret </v>

597
00:29:53.861 --> 00:29:56.320
<v Speaker 2>services to chase them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrest them,</v>

598
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:57.154
<v Speaker 2>kidnapped them and torture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have been literally tortured in </v>

599
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.480
<v Speaker 2>bellerose after one of our projects that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we staged in December 2011,</v>

600
00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:06.964
<v Speaker 2>which was an anniversary 19 December </v>
<v Speaker 2>2011 anniversary of a one year </v>

601
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:12.484
<v Speaker 2>anniversary for huge German stroke </v>
<v Speaker 2>patient in the co where during which </v>

602
00:30:16.271 --> 00:30:17.104
<v Speaker 2>many people have been arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly disappeared and some reportedly </v>

603
00:30:21.011 --> 00:30:21.844
<v Speaker 2>have been killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the information is always hidden </v>

604
00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:27.910
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we stayed in ironical protest,</v>

605
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.890
<v Speaker 2>mocking a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luca Shen come in front of a KGB office,</v>

606
00:30:32.891 --> 00:30:36.840
<v Speaker 2>which is officially official kg be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

607
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 2>a service there.</v>

608
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.033
<v Speaker 2>And during the protests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists have been grabbed by the </v>

609
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.280
<v Speaker 2>staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kgb stuff.</v>

610
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.300
<v Speaker 2>The man who came out of the office of </v>
<v Speaker 2>KGB and we,</v>

611
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 2>we were ignored so we could leave the </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

612
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.780
<v Speaker 2>They certainly knew that they will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to catch us before the,</v>

613
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.653
<v Speaker 2>what was important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that moment for them to stop the </v>

614
00:30:57.761 --> 00:31:01.180
<v Speaker 2>journalist from releasing the images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

615
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.700
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some journalists managed to do it.</v>

616
00:31:03.701 --> 00:31:06.700
<v Speaker 2>They left before I'm having an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

617
00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:07.534
<v Speaker 2>obviously working in Belarus and later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few hours after when we were at the </v>

618
00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:11.074
<v Speaker 2>bus station in Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cisco on our way back to Kiev to </v>

619
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

620
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.083
<v Speaker 2>we have been grabbed and thrown into bus</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which we spend the whole night of </v>

621
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:24.450
<v Speaker 2>being questioned by men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

622
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw their faces.</v>

623
00:31:26.921 --> 00:31:28.410
<v Speaker 2>They didn't hide themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

624
00:31:28.411 --> 00:31:29.244
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were clearly saying that they're </v>

625
00:31:30.941 --> 00:31:34.790
<v Speaker 2>kgb and they were asking us who paid us </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this protests.</v>

626
00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.670
<v Speaker 2>They were saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

627
00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:41.590
<v Speaker 2>would they know that Europe pays us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is ridiculous,</v>

628
00:31:41.591 --> 00:31:42.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is Europe?</v>

629
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to ask them as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did sir.</v>

630
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.773
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were the ones asking </v>

631
00:31:47.981 --> 00:31:48.814
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

633
00:31:49.901 --> 00:31:53.380
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that night we have been brought to</v>

634
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.120
<v Speaker 2>a forest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

635
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

636
00:31:58.331 --> 00:32:02.770
<v Speaker 2>We were taking the bus and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>another group of men,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a faces of who we couldn't see anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

639
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.013
<v Speaker 2>the plastic handcuffs and our hands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were not allowed to move and had to </v>

640
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.640
<v Speaker 2>keep our heads down and looking on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>

641
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we heard during I think five,</v>

642
00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.670
<v Speaker 2>six hours drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we heard that we will be killed.</v>

643
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.460
<v Speaker 2>We heard the description,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

644
00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:27.510
<v Speaker 2>different description of how we can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed at and uh,</v>

645
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will ask to,</v>

646
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:30.603
<v Speaker 2>to breathe loud because they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear us breathing saying that in few </v>

647
00:32:34.481 --> 00:32:36.040
<v Speaker 2>hours we will not be able to breathe.</v>

648
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.903
<v Speaker 2>They were saying that they will send our</v>
<v Speaker 2>core parts of bodies to our mothers and </v>

649
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:43.394
<v Speaker 2>so on and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was of course done very </v>

650
00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:47.560
<v Speaker 2>professionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

651
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:48.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could feel that this man do this </v>

652
00:32:50.691 --> 00:32:51.524
<v Speaker 2>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's their job actually to retort to </v>

653
00:32:53.521 --> 00:32:55.270
<v Speaker 2>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

654
00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:00.250
<v Speaker 2>we received a few hits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were not beating us severely,</v>

655
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 2>but later we were taking out of the bus </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a forest and they're,</v>

656
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were.</v>

657
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.333
<v Speaker 2>They were doing a horrible things such </v>
<v Speaker 2>as putting the blame on us and playing </v>

658
00:33:14.691 --> 00:33:15.260
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

660
00:33:17.571 --> 00:33:21.170
<v Speaker 2>So you feel like you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will burn you alive right now.</v>

661
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.303
<v Speaker 2>They made us undress a turn and so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were creating situations when you feel </v>

662
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.770
<v Speaker 2>like next second they will rape you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will burn you,</v>

663

<v Speaker 2>know green antiseptic and my face,</v>

667
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.673
<v Speaker 2>which I couldn't wash away or like </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that were somehow at some point </v>

668
00:33:50.121 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 2>with some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous,</v>

669
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:54.830
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was tortured,</v>

670
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.230
<v Speaker 2>was psychological and physical torture.</v>

671
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:59.840
<v Speaker 2>They were filming everything on to video</v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras.</v>

672
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 2>So it was supposed to be reported to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

<v Speaker 2>so 15 men around us and masks and the </v>

675
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:08.144
<v Speaker 2>fact that they were wearing masks made </v>
<v Speaker 2>me think that they will not kill us </v>

676
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:13.640
<v Speaker 2>because they hide their faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

677
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.503
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how far they will go in </v>

678
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.460
<v Speaker 2>their action and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they after this torture,</v>

679
00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:24.030
<v Speaker 2>they throw us out of the forest and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

680
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:29.290
<v Speaker 2>we spent another five hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six hours to find someone and we found a</v>

681
00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:32.470
<v Speaker 2>village,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what village?</v>

682
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a big word probably for seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>houses,</v>

683
00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.360
<v Speaker 2>and we were in the middle of the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We found them.</v>

684
00:34:37.361 --> 00:34:38.194
<v Speaker 2>We were lucky enough that at that moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was someone who came from the CT </v>

685
00:34:42.251 --> 00:34:43.084
<v Speaker 2>and had mobile phone and of course for </v>
<v Speaker 2>24 hours already all at least Russian </v>

686
00:34:46.761 --> 00:34:51.761
<v Speaker 2>speaking world researching for us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>information was spread everywhere and we</v>

687
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.890
<v Speaker 2>easily contacted our colleagues and </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists.</v>

688
00:34:54.891 --> 00:34:59.891
<v Speaker 2>And later four hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the embassy of Ukraine arrived to police</v>

689
00:35:00.171 --> 00:35:03.620
<v Speaker 2>station,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we were staying for some time.</v>

690
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:07.640
<v Speaker 2>And it took us back to Kiev.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

691
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.330
<v Speaker 2>well this is one of the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

692
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

693
00:35:11.501 --> 00:35:13.020
<v Speaker 2>in Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

694
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:18.220
<v Speaker 2>also we constantly were falling over by </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret services,</v>

695
00:35:18.531 --> 00:35:20.380
<v Speaker 2>threatened and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

696
00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 2>well they opened for criminal cases </v>
<v Speaker 2>against us for hooliganism.</v>

697
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:25.903
<v Speaker 2>This is some thing that they use in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukrainian Russia against political </v>

698
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 2>activist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

699
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:32.264
<v Speaker 2>right now the reserve artists pop </v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape who burned the door of a </v>

700
00:35:37.231 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Russian secret service,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and he's also redundancy hooligan.</v>

702
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they treat us as a whole against,</v>

703
00:35:42.771 --> 00:35:44.560
<v Speaker 3>because this is something very vague,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

704
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.430
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

705
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.450
<v Speaker 3>you could pull anyone who like and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

706
00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Ukraine,</v>

707
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:52.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

708
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 3>after our first and very loud protest </v>
<v Speaker 3>against union of Church and state,</v>

709
00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to flee.</v>

710
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.930
<v Speaker 3>I had to leave the country because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

711
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.721
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

712
00:36:04.721 --> 00:36:09.721
<v Speaker 3>literally I had to jump out from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>window of my apartment a jump in the car</v>

713
00:36:09.821 --> 00:36:12.680
<v Speaker 3>and run away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

714
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.020
<v Speaker 1>when this stuff has happened to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

715
00:36:15.021 --> 00:36:15.854
<v Speaker 1>I know you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have so many examples of this which </v>

716
00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:18.790
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

717
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.623
<v Speaker 1>we could spend hours talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when these things have happened to </v>

718
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:22.040
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

719
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.860
<v Speaker 1>what happened to you in that forest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds horrific.</v>

720
00:36:24.861 --> 00:36:25.694
<v Speaker 1>You survive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously their goal is </v>

721
00:36:26.901 --> 00:36:28.970
<v Speaker 1>intimidation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their goal of course,</v>

722
00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:29.804
<v Speaker 1>is to silence you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by silencing you they silence </v>

723
00:36:32.361 --> 00:36:34.970
<v Speaker 1>your followers and that's how they end </v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys.</v>

724
00:36:34.971 --> 00:36:38.600
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to actually kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm curious afterwards,</v>

725
00:36:38.601 --> 00:36:43.601
<v Speaker 1>after something like that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you or did you feel all right,</v>

726
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:46.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe we've taken this as far as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>should go or did it,</v>

727
00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:51.110
<v Speaker 1>did you immediately double down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're getting somewhere with this?</v>

728
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:54.523
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course I'm not going to play a </v>

729
00:36:55.341 --> 00:36:56.174
<v Speaker 3>superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course you have older fear you </v>

730
00:36:59.241 --> 00:37:03.460
<v Speaker 3>feel you'll feel that I will not right </v>
<v Speaker 3>after you.</v>

731
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I will never do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

732
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:09.050
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

733
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.033
<v Speaker 3>after some time thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>really spending time on repeating in </v>

734
00:37:14.181 --> 00:37:17.480
<v Speaker 3>your mind what really happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You understand that it's not,</v>

735
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:21.260
<v Speaker 3>it's not us who went too far is their </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction goes too far,</v>

736
00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.220
<v Speaker 3>probably because we do something which </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to happen.</v>

737
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:28.400
<v Speaker 3>And so it means that we do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>very right.</v>

738
00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:29.840
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

739
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:32.690
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will never deny that we have fear.</v>

740
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.553
<v Speaker 3>We do have fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I should say that the fear of the </v>

741
00:37:36.951 --> 00:37:37.784
<v Speaker 3>fear of giving up to those people is </v>
<v Speaker 3>much bigger than fear of being taken to </v>

742
00:37:42.591 --> 00:37:43.424
<v Speaker 3>the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least you already know how it feels </v>

743
00:37:45.891 --> 00:37:47.370
<v Speaker 3>and what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

744
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.400
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fear,</v>

745
00:37:49.401 --> 00:37:50.510
<v Speaker 3>it's a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

746
00:37:50.511 --> 00:37:51.344
<v Speaker 3>So we'll probably make a choice not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fear but to who to deal with the fear </v>

747
00:37:59.751 --> 00:38:01.790
<v Speaker 3>and to continue the activity because </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

748
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:06.190
<v Speaker 3>just think about how ridiculous actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>this all is.</v>

749
00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:11.440
<v Speaker 3>There are girls who take off their tops </v>
<v Speaker 3>and write slogans and for that had taken</v>

750
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.490
<v Speaker 3>to the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>KGB staff,</v>

751
00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:18.350
<v Speaker 3>I spending with them 24 hours torturing </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and doing all the insane things.</v>

752
00:38:18.351 --> 00:38:19.184
<v Speaker 3>How ridiculous this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How ridiculous is the fact that there </v>

753
00:38:22.431 --> 00:38:25.160
<v Speaker 3>are people blending terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks,</v>

754
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.023
<v Speaker 3>taking guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing themselves up because they want </v>

755
00:38:28.911 --> 00:38:30.730
<v Speaker 3>to stop those who drove her car</v>

756
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.033
<v Speaker 3>but caricatures do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know who drove very funny or not </v>

757
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:39.930
<v Speaker 3>funny for some cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something so peaceful.</v>

758
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.030
<v Speaker 3>So somehow very childish as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

759
00:38:43.031 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 3>it was something very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that it also reveals a lot of</v>

760
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 3>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

761
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:51.030
<v Speaker 3>how it shows the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

762
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.400
<v Speaker 3>how crippled our society is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the,</v>

763
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.750
<v Speaker 3>how we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we replaced the fight or the.</v>

764
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fights a of ideas by actually divide</v>

765
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.460
<v Speaker 3>between people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

766
00:39:04.461 --> 00:39:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I think that this is the reason to </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue.</v>

767
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

768
00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:09.491
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:39:09.491 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

770
00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:14.770
<v Speaker 3>you're ready to do it for six years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're only 25 and you already have been</v>

771
00:39:14.771 --> 00:39:16.780
<v Speaker 3>nearly killed at least three times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

772
00:39:16.781 --> 00:39:19.360
<v Speaker 3>what makes you go on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this actually,</v>

773
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:20.223
<v Speaker 3>this is exactly the reason that make you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go go on because you understand that </v>

774
00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:25.060
<v Speaker 3>just because you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

775
00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:25.933
<v Speaker 3>you write three words in your body or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you write an article or you draw a </v>

776
00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.880
<v Speaker 3>cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went to kill you for that.</v>

777
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.863
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't make sure that I leave in six </v>

778
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:36.400
<v Speaker 3>society and because I don't want to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in society,</v>

779
00:39:36.401 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 3>I continue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go on,</v>

780
00:39:37.991 --> 00:39:41.320
<v Speaker 3>I know that the history of my time is </v>
<v Speaker 3>written right now and,</v>

781
00:39:41.321 --> 00:39:44.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well to let fundamentalist,</v>

782
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:48.100
<v Speaker 3>a dictator's misogynists to write </v>
<v Speaker 3>history of my time.</v>

783
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with that.</v>

784
00:39:50.711 --> 00:39:52.930
<v Speaker 3>I want to participate writing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

785
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

786
00:39:54.111 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love everything you just said though.</v>

787
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:59.540
<v Speaker 1>The whole spirit of everything that I do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is exactly that.</v>

788
00:39:59.541 --> 00:40:01.220
<v Speaker 1>You're at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at the front lines of it.</v>

789
00:40:01.221 --> 00:40:04.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good segue actually to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2013,</v>

790
00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got asylum in France and you live in</v>

791
00:40:07.581 --> 00:40:08.414
<v Speaker 1>France now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that must've been an interesting </v>

792
00:40:10.161 --> 00:40:10.994
<v Speaker 1>time to move to France because shortly </v>
<v Speaker 1>after that a was the Charlie Hebdo </v>

793
00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.870
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>

794
00:40:15.871 --> 00:40:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you knew some of the cartoonists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

795
00:40:17.571 --> 00:40:19.550
<v Speaker 1>You had worked with them a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

796
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.570
<v Speaker 1>so can you talk about that?</v>

797
00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew all the Darnest,</v>

798
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:28.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who died and those who survived as</v>

799
00:40:28.341 --> 00:40:29.780
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

800
00:40:29.781 --> 00:40:30.800
<v Speaker 2>we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

801
00:40:30.801 --> 00:40:31.634
<v Speaker 2>we were friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were really friends and we spend a </v>

802
00:40:33.951 --> 00:40:38.240
<v Speaker 2>lot of time just together debating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing and sharing what was shared.</v>

803
00:40:38.241 --> 00:40:39.074
<v Speaker 2>A lot of ideas and to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I arrived to France and after few </v>

804
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:47.720
<v Speaker 2>of protest that we organized in France </v>
<v Speaker 2>and clearly stated our direct message,</v>

805
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:48.703
<v Speaker 2>not message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is following all these demands of </v>

806
00:40:51.111 --> 00:40:53.990
<v Speaker 2>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No unnecessary political,</v>

807
00:40:53.991 --> 00:40:55.470
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

808
00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.280
<v Speaker 2>And you rope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Charlotte.</v>

809
00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.233
<v Speaker 2>We're the only one who were really on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same line with us and we became </v>

810
00:41:03.231 --> 00:41:05.990
<v Speaker 2>really friendly and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very soon.</v>

811
00:41:05.991 --> 00:41:07.660
<v Speaker 2>And we even made a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

812
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.010
<v Speaker 2>one issue of Charlotte though together </v>
<v Speaker 2>with feminine.</v>

813
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

814
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.033
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course we will sometime we were </v>

815
00:41:17.511 --> 00:41:18.344
<v Speaker 2>spending ridging to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the threats that we were receiving and </v>

816
00:41:21.501 --> 00:41:22.334
<v Speaker 2>laughing and making fun of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the fanatics who were spending time </v>

817
00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.410
<v Speaker 2>for writing those threats and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

818
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 2>writing this pitches which they were a </v>
<v Speaker 2>recording</v>

819
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.420
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Voicemails.</v>

820
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

821
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 3>and of course losing your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only friends,</v>

822
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.073
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

823
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:42.913
<v Speaker 3>not only friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do a logic ideological friends or </v>

824
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:46.094
<v Speaker 3>brothers if you want was of course was </v>
<v Speaker 3>again something which of course it's </v>

825
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 3>personally very hard and have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lose,</v>

826
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:56.870
<v Speaker 3>but also is something that reveals the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lord,</v>

827
00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.140
<v Speaker 3>shows you again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows you that if you stop,</v>

828
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.610
<v Speaker 3>then you will fail and new ideas will </v>
<v Speaker 3>fail.</v>

829
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 3>I believe that maybe it will be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will sound a bit old,</v>

830
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 3>but even those cartoonists who died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were killed,</v>

831
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:17.570
<v Speaker 3>they didn't lose and their ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are not,</v>

832
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.210
<v Speaker 3>the ideas are not failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

833
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.150
<v Speaker 3>they will always remain as a nurse and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

834
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.043
<v Speaker 3>those who continue to do what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>believed in and that what they believe </v>

835
00:42:28.101 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Speaker 3>in is the right thing because they will </v>
<v Speaker 3>not harm anyone.</v>

836
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:35.090
<v Speaker 3>They were contributing to a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>

837
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:40.250
<v Speaker 3>since things such as freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression and they were contributing to</v>

838
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:44.780
<v Speaker 3>this to keep and save the values of </v>
<v Speaker 3>France as well,</v>

839
00:42:44.781 --> 00:42:48.620
<v Speaker 3>which is a liberty equality fraternity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

840
00:42:48.621 --> 00:42:50.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes today you think that it,</v>

841
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.110
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it remains only on the buildings written</v>

842
00:42:54.111 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Speaker 3>on the buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not actually in life,</v>

843
00:42:56.241 --> 00:42:59.630
<v Speaker 3>not actually applied and life of society</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

844
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.420
<v Speaker 3>So Charlotte Heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of being friends,</v>

845
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:03.960
<v Speaker 3>they are heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

846
00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.613
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should also mention that just the </v>

847
00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.310
<v Speaker 3>months before they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were killed,</v>

848
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.590
<v Speaker 3>they were racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobes,</v>

849
00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:13.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

850
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:14.583
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will always named for being too </v>

851
00:43:16.671 --> 00:43:19.010
<v Speaker 3>much for going too far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

852
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.930
<v Speaker 3>for offending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all know that.</v>

853
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just to be very clear,</v>

854
00:43:22.981 --> 00:43:25.320
<v Speaker 1>I know this has been said a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>times over,</v>

855
00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.620
<v Speaker 1>but they were not racist and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>not Islamophobia,</v>

856
00:43:28.621 --> 00:43:30.870
<v Speaker 1>which is a made up word by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were not.</v>

857
00:43:30.871 --> 00:43:31.704
<v Speaker 1>They were pointing out the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made fun of everybody and I think </v>

858
00:43:34.621 --> 00:43:38.280
<v Speaker 1>something like it's three percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>covers were about Islam,</v>

859
00:43:38.281 --> 00:43:42.330
<v Speaker 1>but they equally attacked Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Judaism and all the religions.</v>

860
00:43:42.331 --> 00:43:43.164
<v Speaker 1>It was about power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were making cartoons about the </v>

861
00:43:45.031 --> 00:43:48.660
<v Speaker 1>exact things that you were protesting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets.</v>

862
00:43:48.661 --> 00:43:49.860
<v Speaker 1>It was really kind of amazing.</v>

863
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you mentioned just now that</v>

864
00:43:57.331 --> 00:43:58.164
<v Speaker 3>only three percent of the covers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all material in newspaper was </v>

865
00:44:01.711 --> 00:44:06.711
<v Speaker 3>about Islam also shows something that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were also discussing with them often and</v>

866
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.023
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we talk about France and things that </v>

867
00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:13.920
<v Speaker 3>happened in France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe to make sense to quote a voluntary</v>

868
00:44:13.921 --> 00:44:15.550
<v Speaker 3>gain here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

869
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:19.260
<v Speaker 3>and this words attribute it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that if you want to find out who</v>

870
00:44:19.261 --> 00:44:20.094
<v Speaker 3>rules over you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>simply understand who you are not </v>

871
00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:26.040
<v Speaker 3>allowed to criticize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even this three percent,</v>

872
00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:26.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

873
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.980
<v Speaker 3>of the information or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

874
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:29.910
<v Speaker 3>the topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

875
00:44:29.911 --> 00:44:33.530
<v Speaker 3>I slept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just taking three percent of the,</v>

876
00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:38.130
<v Speaker 3>of the whole information off Charlotte </v>
<v Speaker 3>door really shows a lot.</v>

877
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 3>So that of course is the youngest from </v>
<v Speaker 3>three minutes they stick religions,</v>

878
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 3>the most ambitious probably today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most demanding religion.</v>

879
00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.580
<v Speaker 3>It really reveals its face to face and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reacts in a different way.</v>

880
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:51.503
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know you've talked about the </v>

881
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.024
<v Speaker 1>regressive left and it started for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Hebdo was the beginning of my </v>

882
00:44:57.121 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 1>awakening which happened over the course</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the next year or so.</v>

883
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:01.243
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you make of the group of </v>

884
00:45:02.851 --> 00:45:03.684
<v Speaker 1>people and we had plenty of them here in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States and I'm sure you had </v>

885
00:45:06.211 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Speaker 1>plenty of them in France as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People on the left,</v>

886
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:10.913
<v Speaker 1>people that are for women's rights and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for gay rights and for minority rights </v>

887
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.880
<v Speaker 1>that suddenly when it came to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened with Charlie Hebdo at,</v>

888
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:19.200
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have,</v>

889
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have made fun of the </v>

890
00:45:21.511 --> 00:45:23.130
<v Speaker 1>cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have done these cartoons.</v>

891
00:45:23.131 --> 00:45:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Talked about the profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

892
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.920
<v Speaker 1>people who otherwise are totally for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech and free expression.</v>

893
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly they're not in this case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

894
00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:32.163
<v Speaker 1>so what do you make of those people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how pervasive is that idea in France </v>

895
00:45:35.581 --> 00:45:36.414
<v Speaker 1>these days?</v>

896
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:37.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

897
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 3>you said that it all started for you off</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Charlotte.</v>

898
00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:41.034
<v Speaker 3>Do I think that it became so visible in </v>
<v Speaker 3>France as well after Charlotte recently </v>

899
00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:50.840
<v Speaker 3>also after Cologne attacks in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

900
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:51.803
<v Speaker 3>which we can also discuss not only </v>
<v Speaker 3>lectures but also feminist reaction or </v>

901
00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:58.330
<v Speaker 3>feminist non-reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

902
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.540
<v Speaker 3>so I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

903
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:03.690
<v Speaker 3>it's after these events we could see </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

904
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fraction of leftists who would deny the </v>

905
00:46:08.221 --> 00:46:09.054
<v Speaker 3>ins the essential problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would be scared to talk about the </v>

906
00:46:13.651 --> 00:46:16.050
<v Speaker 3>roots of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who will,</v>

907
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.513
<v Speaker 3>who will be willing not to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlotte killers as people with guns </v>

908
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:24.803
<v Speaker 3>and not discuss their ideas and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss what they were screaming wild </v>

909
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.310
<v Speaker 3>shooting our friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were in,</v>

910
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.223
<v Speaker 3>in the name of who they committed these </v>
<v Speaker 3>atrocities and what made them could </v>

911
00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.680
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they have to do that.</v>

912
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.010
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

913
00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:44.130
<v Speaker 3>I think that this is something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

914
00:46:44.131 --> 00:46:44.964
<v Speaker 3>which of course brings Europe in a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>big danger and especially the values of </v>

915
00:46:49.831 --> 00:46:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Europe in a very big danger.</v>

916
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.230
<v Speaker 3>And therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say that sometimes working in Paris,</v>

917
00:46:55.231 --> 00:46:59.220
<v Speaker 3>I read this three words that the slogan </v>
<v Speaker 3>of French Revolution,</v>

918
00:46:59.221 --> 00:47:03.620
<v Speaker 3>and I understand that this is very far </v>
<v Speaker 3>from reality today from the society,</v>

919
00:47:03.621 --> 00:47:08.621
<v Speaker 3>and of course you hear the leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the leftest leaders here who tried to,</v>

920
00:47:09.781 --> 00:47:10.614
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make speeches to defend freedom of </v>

921
00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:16.440
<v Speaker 3>expression and make of Charlotte door a </v>
<v Speaker 3>heroes,</v>

922
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're,</v>

923
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:21.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John List who fell down but they do not,</v>

924
00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:25.680
<v Speaker 3>will not want to discuss for which ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

925
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.410
<v Speaker 3>they found that for which ideas they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were killed.</v>

926
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.730
<v Speaker 3>So many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:34.540
<v Speaker 3>of course do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out of fear,</v>

928
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:39.750
<v Speaker 3>but very different theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a very big fear to be a,</v>

929
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.430
<v Speaker 3>to have similar speech too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing,</v>

930
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:43.773
<v Speaker 3>similar speech to actually xenophobes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and racists such as Japan here in </v>

931
00:47:52.241 --> 00:47:53.074
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore left is decided to take this </v>

932
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:57.970
<v Speaker 3>very ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

933
00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:02.971
<v Speaker 3>intellectually dishonest position such </v>
<v Speaker 3>as denying their roots.</v>

934
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:05.300
<v Speaker 3>And they did the real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

935
00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:09.010
<v Speaker 3>the central problem in the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think this way,</v>

936
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:13.330
<v Speaker 3>the betrayal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the ideas of Charlotte and of course,</v>

937
00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.190
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at the end,</v>

938
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.810
<v Speaker 3>the result is that it's only or extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing,</v>

939
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:20.853
<v Speaker 3>the racists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the xenophobes who are speaking out </v>

940
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.230
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

941
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

942
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:29.060
<v Speaker 1>this is what I've said repeatedly here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we on the left have to deal with</v>

943
00:48:29.061 --> 00:48:29.894
<v Speaker 1>this because if we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is exactly what your peace in </v>

944
00:48:32.961 --> 00:48:34.610
<v Speaker 1>the international business times was </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

945
00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:35.600
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

946
00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:38.120
<v Speaker 1>if we don't deal with the regressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

947
00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.220
<v Speaker 1>then who do we hand it to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The racist,</v>

948
00:48:40.221 --> 00:48:41.054
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

949
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.430
<v Speaker 1>that was your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your term.</v>

950
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:43.343
<v Speaker 1>And I couldn't agree more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say that France in terms of </v>

951
00:48:45.921 --> 00:48:49.610
<v Speaker 1>free speech and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people getting along,</v>

952
00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.640
<v Speaker 1>would you say Francis in a worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>position now,</v>

953
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:56.210
<v Speaker 1>do you think that there was a net loss </v>
<v Speaker 1>in free speech after Charlie Hebdo?</v>

954
00:48:56.211 --> 00:48:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Because there were a couple weeks after </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the whole world united and,</v>

955
00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:00.703
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those world leaders came to Paris </v>

956
00:49:02.091 --> 00:49:04.010
<v Speaker 1>and it sounded like something good was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>

957
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:06.590
<v Speaker 1>But I sent you think it's probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse now.</v>

958
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

959
00:49:08.301 --> 00:49:10.940
<v Speaker 3>there are so many aspects to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

960
00:49:10.941 --> 00:49:15.941
<v Speaker 3>This manifestation that happened after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 11th of January was ridiculous.</v>

961
00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.051
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

962
00:49:17.051 --> 00:49:17.601
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

963
00:49:17.601 --> 00:49:21.230
<v Speaker 3>the cartoonists who survived a lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

964
00:49:21.231 --> 00:49:23.510
<v Speaker 3>who made the next cover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

965
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:27.640
<v Speaker 3>was Muhammad was prophet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

966
00:49:27.641 --> 00:49:31.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were laughing with him again.</v>

967
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Parity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

968
00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.613
<v Speaker 3>Rebel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing because in front of him there </v>

969
00:49:37.431 --> 00:49:42.431
<v Speaker 3>was a line of all the enemies of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Charlotte and they will marching,</v>

970
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:45.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

971
00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:50.090
<v Speaker 3>if this event was so full of hypocrisy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because fact they were marching at least</v>

972
00:49:50.901 --> 00:49:52.550
<v Speaker 3>this front line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

973
00:49:52.551 --> 00:49:53.900
<v Speaker 3>marching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not for the,</v>

974
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:56.450
<v Speaker 3>not for the right ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

975
00:49:56.451 --> 00:49:58.970
<v Speaker 3>they were pretending they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

976
00:49:58.971 --> 00:50:00.590
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was fake.</v>

977
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about the million of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

978
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:09.230
<v Speaker 3>but I'm talking about this front line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was totally ridiculous.</v>

979
00:50:09.231 --> 00:50:10.064
<v Speaker 3>And what happened after there was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many events dedicated to discussion of </v>

980
00:50:16.071 --> 00:50:18.360
<v Speaker 3>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we were,</v>

981
00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 3>which were cancelled by the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by police,</v>

982
00:50:22.361 --> 00:50:23.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to,</v>

983
00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

984
00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 3>for security reasons or events in which </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

985
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:29.390
<v Speaker 3>myself was supposed to participate.</v>

986
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.950
<v Speaker 3>So many of them were canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

987
00:50:31.951 --> 00:50:32.784
<v Speaker 3>the event that happened just one month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often Copenhagen during which I was </v>

988
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:40.370
<v Speaker 3>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was interrupted by another terrorist.</v>

989
00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:41.060
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

990
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.320
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

991
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:45.110
<v Speaker 3>one person who had been killed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>injured.</v>

992
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:47.500
<v Speaker 3>So this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

993
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.030
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we failed after Charlotte,</v>

994
00:50:50.031 --> 00:50:54.290
<v Speaker 3>do we failed with all this ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing such as inviting,</v>

995
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:55.303
<v Speaker 3>actually the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the representatives or those of those </v>

996
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:00.970
<v Speaker 3>who are feeding the terrorist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

997
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.113
<v Speaker 3>those who feed the ideas that are well </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually cannot go exist with ideas of </v>

998
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:09.503
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Inviting them to Paris to March for </v>

999
00:51:11.461 --> 00:51:16.310
<v Speaker 3>ideas of Charlotte is something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>already showed that we will fail in this</v>

1000
00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:19.850
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't want to make your conclusion</v>

1001
00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:23.090
<v Speaker 3>that we did fail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel we are failing.</v>

1002
00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:26.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm here in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Europe is fading.</v>

1003
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.890
<v Speaker 3>European society is failing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not ready to weld to face.</v>

1004
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Very uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unpleasant,</v>

1005
00:51:34.011 --> 00:51:35.900
<v Speaker 3>but truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are not,</v>

1006
00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.053
<v Speaker 3>they are not able to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unpopular speech and freedom of speech </v>

1007
00:51:42.081 --> 00:51:45.290
<v Speaker 3>is really about something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If liberty is really something,</v>

1008
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:48.920
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely about unpopular speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about hearing,</v>

1009
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:50.023
<v Speaker 3>accepting this unpopular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable speech and to Europe is </v>

1010
00:51:53.271 --> 00:51:54.500
<v Speaker 3>failing of doing that.</v>

1011
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:55.483
<v Speaker 1>So we only have a couple of minutes left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know we're just getting into the </v>

1012
00:51:57.171 --> 00:51:58.004
<v Speaker 1>meat of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to have to do this again </v>

1013
00:51:58.971 --> 00:52:01.430
<v Speaker 1>where we can talk for much longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1014
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:02.463
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear you on the Europe part and </v>

1015
00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:04.004
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get so much email now from the same </v>

1016
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:07.243
<v Speaker 1>people saying the same things in Denmark</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in France and in Germany and </v>

1017
00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Finland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these countries,</v>

1018
00:52:12.621 --> 00:52:13.454
<v Speaker 1>people are saying the exact same things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're talking about and they feel </v>

1019
00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:18.530
<v Speaker 1>that there is no faith in the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the governments are going to do the</v>

1020
00:52:18.531 --> 00:52:20.840
<v Speaker 1>right things and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1021
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:21.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's end on this.</v>

1022
00:52:21.981 --> 00:52:26.630
<v Speaker 1>So the Cologne event that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened in Germany with this,</v>

1023
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.553
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a thousand men were </v>
<v Speaker 1>running rampant throughout the city and </v>

1024
00:52:30.561 --> 00:52:33.290
<v Speaker 1>it's unclear if they were all immigrants</v>
<v Speaker 1>or migrants or whatever it was.</v>

1025
00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:37.830
<v Speaker 1>The reaction to that must have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly upsetting to you because he</v>

1026
00:52:37.831 --> 00:52:42.831
<v Speaker 1>dealt with sort of the free speech stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bringing all these people in.</v>

1027
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.250
<v Speaker 1>But it also directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was in a direct assault on women.</v>

1028
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:47.323
<v Speaker 1>So it really went to everything that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about was the reaction to that </v>

1029
00:52:50.181 --> 00:52:53.060
<v Speaker 1>because I saw a feminists that were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>defending the women.</v>

1030
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I suddenly saw a feminist online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well known feminists that were saying,</v>

1031
00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.393
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just an excuse for the </v>

1032
00:52:59.241 --> 00:53:02.720
<v Speaker 1>xenophobes and white men do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of those things.</v>

1033
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:03.843
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was one must have been </v>

1034
00:53:04.371 --> 00:53:05.480
<v Speaker 1>particularly upsetting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1035
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:06.971
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1036
00:53:06.971 --> 00:53:07.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1037
00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:10.970
<v Speaker 3>of course it was not only on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only upsetting,</v>

1038
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.900
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>

1039
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Today we use,</v>

1040
00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:15.643
<v Speaker 3>you look around and you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those who were supposed to be your </v>

1041
00:53:17.901 --> 00:53:18.734
<v Speaker 3>allies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those supports to share with you with a </v>

1042
00:53:21.211 --> 00:53:26.211
<v Speaker 3>very fundamental values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Stanford them either keep silence or</v>

1043
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 3>try to support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually you are aggressors.</v>

1044
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:34.710
<v Speaker 3>The of women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because of the fact it was reported</v>

1045
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.573
<v Speaker 3>that among the aggressors were men know </v>
<v Speaker 3>who looked like Arabic man or north </v>

1046
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 3>African region feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>silence.</v>

1047
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.200
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1048
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:51.230
<v Speaker 3>what actually happened just because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fear of again being,</v>

1049
00:53:51.511 --> 00:53:52.344
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having the speech of extreme right wing </v>

1050
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:59.240
<v Speaker 3>and at the end who appeared to be actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>defenders of a women,</v>

1051
00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:01.134
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were raped an aggressive after </v>

1052
00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:05.130
<v Speaker 3>prolonged what extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1053
00:54:05.131 --> 00:54:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Wait again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the platform was giving to them.</v>

1054
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 3>So I think that to those people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>write you emails and to people who write</v>

1055
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:17.530
<v Speaker 3>me as well a lot and put support who </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel very feel betrayed,</v>

1056
00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.320
<v Speaker 3>the sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1057
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:24.321
<v Speaker 3>by the situation with that is going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>today in Europe by leftist reactions,</v>

1058
00:54:24.331 --> 00:54:27.600
<v Speaker 3>by the reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of a reaction of the feminists.</v>

1059
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:32.900
<v Speaker 3>I think we have to understand that to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>sad is not enough to be sad,</v>

1060
00:54:33.301 --> 00:54:34.134
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes people cry and a stay at home and </v>

1061
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.280
<v Speaker 3>feel low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1062
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:40.800
<v Speaker 3>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what we have to be,</v>

1063
00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:44.160
<v Speaker 3>many people don't like to face it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we have to be today,</v>

1064
00:54:44.161 --> 00:54:48.000
<v Speaker 3>we have to be angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think anger brings people to action.</v>

1065
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Not Hate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anger.</v>

1066
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.493
<v Speaker 3>Anger for defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the fact that you ideas are </v>

1067
00:54:55.411 --> 00:54:56.244
<v Speaker 3>attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that something very essential for your </v>

1068
00:54:58.351 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 3>life and joy of life which people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>today here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>have to feel anger.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Don't feel sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel angry.</v>

1072
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:12.203
<v Speaker 3>Act and defend your ideas and don't let </v>
<v Speaker 3>the extreme right wing ride your own </v>

1073
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.513
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
