00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.983
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is British author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist and political commentator </v>

2
00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is also the associate director of the</v>

3
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Henry Jackson Society and associate </v>
<v Speaker 1>editor of the spectator.</v>

4
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Douglas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

5
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Very good to be with him to see you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

6
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how we haven't done this in</v>
<v Speaker 1>person yet.</v>

7
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>They haven't been in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in God's name are you doing?</v>

9
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Living anywhere else besides la?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.403
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually not my favorite bit of </v>

11
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:32.774
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say I find it slightly </v>

12
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>unscented and routines because also </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't drive.</v>

13
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:40.160
<v Speaker 1>So La is sort of hell because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk anywhere.</v>

14
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.383
<v Speaker 1>Well I know you're not making that up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were stuck on a plane for </v>

15
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>about four hours last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You arrived at like 2:00</v>

16
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.343
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we tried to send a car to get you </v>

17
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:49.994
<v Speaker 1>this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That took some time if it's me being </v>

18
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:53.714
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.633
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

20
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch the three films before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the plane even took off last night.</v>

21
00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:59.450
<v Speaker 1>She's New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything good?</v>

22
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.940
<v Speaker 1>No awful films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all bad or mad?</v>

23
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.203
<v Speaker 1>Almost always bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel you're at your intellectual </v>

24
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>best right now because you didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>much sleep?</v>

25
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>The you're ready to do that defends our </v>
<v Speaker 1>mangers.</v>

26
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>You want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I've got some pretty rigorous questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

28
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's an interesting way to</v>

29
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>kick off because you are somebody that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>everything that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I see you.</v>

31
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the events that you speak at and,</v>

32
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>and the talks that you've given all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

33
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.783
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to be at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual best pretty much all the </v>

34
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you feel you always are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

36
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>but what kind of pressure does that put </v>
<v Speaker 1>you under just to be,</v>

37
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>to be one of the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.583
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a cohesive set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and be able to defend them all </v>

39
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:44.024
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

40
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure you have to have the keys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I tell you what I mean.</v>

41
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.243
<v Speaker 1>I don't admire or envy politicians for </v>
<v Speaker 1>having to have the thing of having to </v>

42
00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>turn up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the right thing.</v>

43
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Never be off message and all that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

44
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I kind of feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

46
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I can have bad days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I can change my mind on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can nuance things,</v>

48
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>texture things or I can be garbled one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and um,</v>

49
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody says,</v>

50
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a total train wreck.</v>

51
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they did.</v>

52
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we care.</v>

53
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.023
<v Speaker 1>it's funny you say that because right </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we started we were talking about </v>

55
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:25.064
<v Speaker 1>social media a little bit when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying how you don't respond that often </v>

56
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:29.600
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or paying that much attention to that.</v>

57
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not on Facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on twitter.</v>

58
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:34.660
<v Speaker 1>I use twitter as a way to communicate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the few people who can,</v>

59
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything I write or appear on.</v>

60
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't talk to the world as it </v>

61
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:41.440
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's doable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it drives people mad.</v>

63
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Seeing some of the least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Bernard really promising minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My generation slightly wracked by social</v>

65
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:52.450
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't seek out people to shout at</v>

68
00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>you in the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you wouldn't.</v>

69
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>If they did say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come</v>

70
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.023
<v Speaker 2>over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say this more regular basis and do it </v>

71
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 2>when I wake up and turn over in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and turning my phone on.</v>

72
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do think that people have to find a</v>

73
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 2>sort of reasonable way to live in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange,</v>

74
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:14.434
<v Speaker 2>strange world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is even stranger in our hail is </v>

75
00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:16.170
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

76
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>

77
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.680
<v Speaker 3>it's much stranger in La and we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going for dinner tonight.</v>

78
00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:22.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to show you how we can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

79
00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:25.020
<v Speaker 3>what's weird in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna I'm gonna show you tonight.</v>

80
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me a little bit.</v>

81
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.043
<v Speaker 3>So we've done this once before and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was about two years ago and I had just </v>

82
00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:30.954
<v Speaker 3>started doing an interview show and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about a lot of the problems </v>

83
00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:33.984
<v Speaker 3>that we both had with the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rise of Islam in some of that we're </v>

84
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:36.900
<v Speaker 3>going to cover here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

85
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.823
<v Speaker 3>but I thought maybe we could just talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a little bit about your history </v>

86
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:43.440
<v Speaker 3>first and what kind of brought you to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

87
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.220
<v Speaker 3>one of the few people that is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>outspoken on some of these issues.</v>

88
00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:49.650
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what made you care about the free speech</v>

89
00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:52.140
<v Speaker 3>stuff about what's happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>west,</v>

90
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:54.030
<v Speaker 3>all of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did that really spark in you?</v>

91
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

92
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:56.784
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things are easier to recognize </v>

93
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.710
<v Speaker 2>other people than they are in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

94
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.870
<v Speaker 2>I've written about a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in my life.</v>

95
00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I started writing very young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became a,</v>

96
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.860
<v Speaker 2>became a published author as it were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote my first book when I was 18,</v>

97
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.120
<v Speaker 2>came out when I was 19 or 20 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

98
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.030
<v Speaker 2>that was on literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

99
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.230
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or literally figure.</v>

100
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.640
<v Speaker 2>And then I started writing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and the one thing which,</v>

101
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.983
<v Speaker 2>somebody once said to me about me as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well that I thought it was probably </v>

103
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 2>somewhere near the truth was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody once said that I had a very low</v>

104
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Speaker 2>tolerance threshold for lies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there is something in that.</v>

105
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:35.574
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

106
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it all wear out at some point,</v>

107
00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:42.720
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just overdose as it were on </v>
<v Speaker 2>lies.</v>

108
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.130
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

109
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

110
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like being told lies and I don't</v>

111
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:51.980
<v Speaker 2>like it about historical things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my first book is partly about,</v>

112
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.943
<v Speaker 2>I think it has sort of set of historical</v>
<v Speaker 2>misunderstandings that had happened in </v>

113
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:58.680
<v Speaker 2>relation to the figure I was writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and I wanted to correct them.</v>

114
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.020
<v Speaker 2>And then in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

115
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 2>if you have a low tolerance for lies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just not the right area.</v>

116
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 2>So that was my next question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you picked it,</v>

117
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.120
<v Speaker 2>not because I got into surfing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something I didn't know,</v>

118
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

119
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Speaker 2>but policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and political lives,</v>

120
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:14.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

121
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.353
<v Speaker 2>galvanizes me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose the other thing is that </v>

122
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

123
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:20.274
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care who's running in </v>

124
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>that district for which party and which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

125
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.860
<v Speaker 2>party they voted for four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I sort of thing is interesting.</v>

126
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not what I spend my life feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly oppressed or,</v>

127
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enamored with.</v>

128
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.000
<v Speaker 2>But I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

129
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.570
<v Speaker 2>I do think that if you care about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture in the widest sense as I do,</v>

130
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.270
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to be interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

131
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.681
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

132
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to take some attitude towards</v>

133
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:45.924
<v Speaker 2>it and they say in order that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>further your political goals or </v>

134
00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:51.780
<v Speaker 2>something if you want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should really be a politician.</v>

135
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 2>But I think in order to try to safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>guard coach,</v>

136
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.454
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

137
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.413
<v Speaker 2>I don't even mean the coats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really to safeguard the practice </v>

138
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 2>of culture and then that's what politics</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to me to be very largely for.</v>

139
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm quite interested in taxation and not</v>

140
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:09.614
<v Speaker 2>very interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want the circumstances to be </v>

141
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 2>right for the culture to thrive.</v>

142
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when people say,</v>

143
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.441
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

144
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a political person or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

145
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that phrase because it really.</v>

146
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 3>What are you actually saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

147
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 3>you're either pretending that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>above it or you somehow don't need it.</v>

148
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 3>And yet politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

149
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:32.384
<v Speaker 3>It's about creating the conditions so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can do all of the other things </v>

150
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 3>you care.</v>

151
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.223
<v Speaker 2>I think what people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of people mean when they say </v>

152
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:38.940
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

153
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.013
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a party person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna bore on about the Labor </v>

154
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Party Organ Soda Party of the Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 2>or Republicans.</v>

155
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what what people mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in any case,</v>

156
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people who said that sometime </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago don't see that anymore.</v>

157
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.893
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe the more they said in the </v>

158
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.180
<v Speaker 2>past they weren't a politics person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more now the shrieking and jibberish</v>

159
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 2>and storming.</v>

160
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's a danger in that?</v>

161
00:07:03.361 --> 00:07:04.800
<v Speaker 3>So we had all these people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

162
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.240
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whatever that meant to them,</v>

163
00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:07.074
<v Speaker 3>they weren't politics people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now everybody's shrieking and </v>

164
00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:12.720
<v Speaker 3>screaming and everyone's in the part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it that you just said,</v>

165
00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:13.554
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't really do it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That piece of the day to day race horse </v>

166
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.903
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I try to focus on the </v>

167
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.363
<v Speaker 3>philosophical stuff because [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's running for this or all of that </v>

168
00:07:24.271 --> 00:07:24.631
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

169
00:07:24.631 --> 00:07:28.510
<v Speaker 3>it's important at some level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the bigger picture stuff that I</v>

170
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.363
<v Speaker 3>think really matters.</v>

171
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

172
00:07:30.461 --> 00:07:32.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.840
<v Speaker 2>to a great extent in your country and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind,</v>

174
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.823
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a type of person now who I </v>

175
00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:39.850
<v Speaker 2>think has got politics all the wrong way</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

176
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it is,</v>

177
00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:42.454
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who didn't pay much attention to </v>

178
00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:45.250
<v Speaker 2>it in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are people who are now,</v>

179
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.013
<v Speaker 2>I think putting onto politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an amount of weight that it can't </v>

180
00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 2>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

181
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.840
<v Speaker 2>It's about their entire existence as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

182
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.780
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't want that to be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

183
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.120
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

184
00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:01.954
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

185
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had with a colleague sometime ago,</v>

186
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.950
<v Speaker 2>sort of informal competition of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservative Party won the 2015 election</v>

187
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 2>in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had An informal competition to say,</v>

188
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.540
<v Speaker 2>now what's the nuttiest thing anyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>said?</v>

189
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:14.374
<v Speaker 2>And the best was his woman at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Guardian who wrote a column saying that </v>

190
00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:18.274
<v Speaker 2>basically she cried herself to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>every night and she woke up in the </v>

191
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Speaker 2>morning crying and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes she stopped crying.</v>

192
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:23.020
<v Speaker 2>She woke up because you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

193
00:08:23.021 --> 00:08:23.741
<v Speaker 2>I've had a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

194
00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:25.360
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she burst into tears again.</v>

195
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 2>That person shouldn't really be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

196
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:30.764
<v Speaker 2>it should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

197
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.510
<v Speaker 2>but if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

198
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have views.</v>

199
00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:35.914
<v Speaker 2>I was on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to win and at any one time which </v>

200
00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:38.590
<v Speaker 2>party I'd vote for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

201
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.023
<v Speaker 2>but I cannot imagine any scenario in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which I became such a jittering wreck </v>

202
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:45.963
<v Speaker 2>that I just wept all the time or because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she might not have been telling the </v>

203
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.690
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this con or thought it wise to say to</v>

204
00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:54.700
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the state I'm in.</v>

205
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.591
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

206
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shows</v>

207
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.740
<v Speaker 2>her victimhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's such a victim.</v>

208
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.583
<v Speaker 2>She can't sleep the best is when you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Huffington post or one of these </v>

209
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:01.614
<v Speaker 2>pieces probably in the Guardian to where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just them that are carrying </v>

210
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 2>their children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Waking Up,</v>

211
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:05.994
<v Speaker 2>having nightmares about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My three year old's having a nightmare </v>

212
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 2>about drumming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can I,</v>

213
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 2>what should I tell my three year old?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now he's asking about trump.</v>

214
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:17.250
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I tend to go to sleep.</v>

215
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny,</v>

216
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted this out a couple months ago,</v>

217
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 2>but when we're in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>

218
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:24.511
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

219
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 2>all these articles are getting ready to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kick kick how trump is affecting kids.</v>

220
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 2>This one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I asked,</v>

221
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 2>I asked my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

222
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was five or six,</v>

223
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:34.020
<v Speaker 2>my nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

224
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you know about Donald Trump?</v>

225
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:36.930
<v Speaker 2>He looks at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

226
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.530
<v Speaker 2>he has bad hair and a red tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

227
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Speaker 2>that's what again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what a kid would think.</v>

228
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to talk about your book,</v>

229
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:45.024
<v Speaker 2>but I thought before we get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do a little bit more on just </v>

230
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:49.440
<v Speaker 2>sort of language in general and the free</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech thing.</v>

231
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.663
<v Speaker 2>So when you come to America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have some extra protections </v>

232
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.673
<v Speaker 2>for now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least on free speech that you guys </v>

233
00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 2>across Europe don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel an extra degree of freedom?</v>

234
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't strike me as someone that ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>bites your tongue,</v>

235
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:05.334
<v Speaker 2>but when you come here and know that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have such a great free or do you see </v>

236
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 2>something a little different here </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps?</v>

237
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I think you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

238
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:12.084
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you just got to separate out </v>

239
00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:13.724
<v Speaker 2>between the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your legal rights are as it were </v>

240
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:19.160
<v Speaker 2>and what the actual practice is these </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

241
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Legally.</v>

242
00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:23.084
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing I say that it's illegal </v>

243
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:26.900
<v Speaker 2>in Britain or Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

244
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I don't particularly feel,</v>

245
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he sort of freer to say anything </v>

246
00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:33.524
<v Speaker 2>here because there's nothing I would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>here that I wouldn't say there and vice </v>

247
00:10:35.421 --> 00:10:36.900
<v Speaker 2>versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

248
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.320
<v Speaker 2>it's true that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the having a,</v>

249
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.213
<v Speaker 2>an amendment to our constitution that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she writes this in the law is a useful </v>

250
00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:44.144
<v Speaker 2>thing to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we of course don't even have a </v>

251
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:49.280
<v Speaker 2>constitution in Britain which has its </v>
<v Speaker 2>own advantages and problems.</v>

252
00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:50.300
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

253
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:51.973
<v Speaker 2>but I think these things have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly divorced from the reality of </v>

254
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:57.980
<v Speaker 2>the practice as is at the moment and at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment,</v>

255
00:10:57.981 --> 00:10:58.814
<v Speaker 2>I think your probably in a worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation than we are in Britain or </v>

256
00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Europe in relation to speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

257
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.983
<v Speaker 2>mainly because of a generation of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are growing up and the most </v>

258
00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:13.110
<v Speaker 2>privileged generation in history who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

259
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.323
<v Speaker 2>seemed to think that speech is violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that in response to violence you </v>

260
00:11:20.061 --> 00:11:22.790
<v Speaker 2>should be violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you make that leap,</v>

261
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.410
<v Speaker 2>then the response or somebody speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the them and a or shutting down or to</v>

262
00:11:27.411 --> 00:11:31.970
<v Speaker 2>burn a building or to get them killed or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want.</v>

263
00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And I see that all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the place.</v>

264
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Somebody I know in Holland who died just</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple weeks ago,</v>

265
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.273
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people in the press have him </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonizing him and his house was </v>

266
00:11:44.151 --> 00:11:48.200
<v Speaker 2>attacked two nights ago in Amsterdam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

267
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:52.040
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loads of loads of target selection.</v>

268
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

269
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all this is very,</v>

270
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 2>very worried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that in general,</v>

271
00:11:58.751 --> 00:11:59.584
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you seem in America to make terrible </v>

272
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:02.554
<v Speaker 2>generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be slightly further down the road of </v>

273
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 2>certain manias about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

274
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.990
<v Speaker 2>it seems to embed itself more this idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>of being wounded or even hurt by,</v>

275
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by words and,</v>

276
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.141
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

277
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:20.890
<v Speaker 2>and you've got all of the saw stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly worse I think.</v>

278
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.893
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that may be just that in </v>

279
00:12:24.151 --> 00:12:24.984
<v Speaker 3>and of itself could be just a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that Americans kind of scream </v>

280
00:12:27.721 --> 00:12:30.120
<v Speaker 3>about things more?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're a little more hysterical.</v>

281
00:12:30.121 --> 00:12:31.620
<v Speaker 3>You guys are a little more polite.</v>

282
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I was asking a friend in New York about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this the other day.</v>

283
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

284
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I wonder whether the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

285
00:12:37.941 --> 00:12:39.230
<v Speaker 2>that thing that you always hear in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

286
00:12:39.231 --> 00:12:41.480
<v Speaker 2>this is the most important election of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our lifetime.</v>

287
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Every single one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's always,</v>

288
00:12:44.001 --> 00:12:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

289
00:12:44.841 --> 00:12:45.674
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by the language </v>

290
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.163
<v Speaker 2>hyperventilation in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was fascinated by that moment </v>

291
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.420
<v Speaker 2>before the last election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Bill Maher said,</v>

292
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.890
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we called,</v>

293
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

294
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.290
<v Speaker 2>senator mccain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the massage.</v>

295
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.690
<v Speaker 2>And so we were just doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to get him,</v>

296
00:12:59.691 --> 00:13:00.320
<v Speaker 2>and we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

297
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.460
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we did.</v>

298
00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:03.440
<v Speaker 2>They tell on him and then we realized he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't really.</v>

299
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Romney wasn't really misogynist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now this guy is.</v>

300
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.853
<v Speaker 2>So I'm fascinated by this thing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically a lot of sort of chickens </v>

301
00:13:08.631 --> 00:13:09.464
<v Speaker 2>coming home to roost in some ways you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kept running the language down and </v>

302
00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:15.350
<v Speaker 2>now you're in this position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I said to this friend in America the</v>

303
00:13:15.351 --> 00:13:17.260
<v Speaker 2>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the,</v>

304
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:18.230
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the as it were,</v>

305
00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:19.064
<v Speaker 2>the hyperventilation of politics is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the ways in which you keep your </v>

306
00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:23.594
<v Speaker 2>democracy fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We maybe you have to live with that </v>

307
00:13:26.331 --> 00:13:26.841
<v Speaker 2>pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

308
00:13:26.841 --> 00:13:30.170
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't particularly want to live at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it myself all the time,</v>

309
00:13:30.171 --> 00:13:31.004
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps the kind of this is always </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important moment ever is </v>

310
00:13:35.121 --> 00:13:35.954
<v Speaker 2>important for this democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's better than sort of doesn't </v>

311
00:13:42.201 --> 00:13:44.990
<v Speaker 2>really matter or never going to be as </v>
<v Speaker 2>good as that.</v>

312
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

313
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.113
<v Speaker 3>that's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ruminate on that a little </v>

314
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 3>bit because I think you can argue it </v>
<v Speaker 3>both ways.</v>

315
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:51.050
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's what you're saying.</v>

316
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 3>I can see a problem with that level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hysteria all the time.</v>

317
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:57.520
<v Speaker 3>And you're right when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Bill Maher said that,</v>

318
00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:58.451
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

319
00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:00.490
<v Speaker 3>The left was saying all these horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>things about mccain.</v>

320
00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 3>We did it about mccain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did about romy.</v>

321
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.970
<v Speaker 3>This is the real one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

322
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:04.804
<v Speaker 3>you've cried wolf to the point now that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you expect to happen in an odd </v>

323
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:10.361
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a,</v>

324
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 3>is that a pro trump argument?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strangely,</v>

325
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 3>like he was of course what was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen here.</v>

326
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.073
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you tried it with you try to have </v>

327
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:18.844
<v Speaker 3>some decent sorta center right people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of course you're going to get this </v>

328
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:21.930
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

329
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.100
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

330
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

331
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm resistant myself to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

332
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.160
<v Speaker 2>to introducing Donald Trump told me any </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion almost always derails after,</v>

333
00:14:32.161 --> 00:14:32.994
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after almost everything that happens in </v>

334
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.860
<v Speaker 2>the UK in recent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last year or so,</v>

335
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.620
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

336
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.493
<v Speaker 2>how will this affect Donald Trump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get stopped talking about to say allow </v>

337
00:14:43.231 --> 00:14:45.840
<v Speaker 2>other things in the world to exist as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

338
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.953
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're mayor of London was </v>

339
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:50.440
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want trump to come here,</v>

340
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 3>you'd be okay if trump showed up.</v>

341
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:52.963
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just saying that Donald </v>

342
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Trump has made an official visit to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paris.</v>

343
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's made official visits to Germany to </v>

344
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.773
<v Speaker 2>a toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So quite a lot of allied countries by </v>

345
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:07.100
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

346
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:07.934
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's outrageous and I think </v>

347
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 2>people should protest if they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest.</v>

348
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:13.060
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

349
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.800
<v Speaker 2>and I remember the protests against </v>
<v Speaker 2>George W dot Bush when he came to London</v>

350
00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.820
<v Speaker 2>and during his presidency and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>some very,</v>

351
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 2>very vehement protests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

352
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.670
<v Speaker 2>but I don't mind people protesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it's a right,</v>

353
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.440
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this attempt to say,</v>

354
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:28.274
<v Speaker 2>I mean our most important ally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly an important time in our </v>

355
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:32.354
<v Speaker 2>national history in Britain when we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be re reforming our alliances and </v>

356
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.183
<v Speaker 2>renewing them to say f off to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of your closest allies seems </v>

357
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:45.920
<v Speaker 2>to me to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unwise as well as rude.</v>

358
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it one of those things where it's </v>

359
00:15:47.821 --> 00:15:49.770
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the easy answer,</v>

360
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just all that I'm here with a will,</v>

361
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.610
<v Speaker 3>it shows how good we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't let him hear,</v>

362
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.623
<v Speaker 3>but actually what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually do damage to probably </v>

363
00:15:57.061 --> 00:16:00.070
<v Speaker 3>the most important relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these countries have.</v>

364
00:16:00.071 --> 00:16:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Some.</v>

365
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean when the mayor of London says we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want him in London.</v>

366
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well while he's in Paris in Berlin,</v>

367
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.970
<v Speaker 2>like what have you achieved the best you</v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

368
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:11.063
<v Speaker 2>you'll damage among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economic relations between Britain </v>

369
00:16:13.571 --> 00:16:15.280
<v Speaker 2>and America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Nice work,</v>

370
00:16:15.281 --> 00:16:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice work.</v>

371
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.853
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

372
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.641
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

373
00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:20.200
<v Speaker 3>so we're almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're almost at your book.</v>

374
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.760
<v Speaker 3>So I thought this is the good transition</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

375
00:16:21.761 --> 00:16:24.130
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>

376
00:16:24.131 --> 00:16:26.590
<v Speaker 3>you're not your last discussion with Sam</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris,</v>

377
00:16:26.591 --> 00:16:27.424
<v Speaker 3>maybe the one before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you were guys were talking about </v>

378
00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:30.364
<v Speaker 3>language and sort of the slow erosion of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening in the west and the </v>

379
00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:35.740
<v Speaker 3>rise of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the,</v>

380
00:16:35.741 --> 00:16:36.574
<v Speaker 3>the key stuff that we all kind of talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about and you were talking about how </v>

381
00:16:39.101 --> 00:16:39.934
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be arguing about gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>pronouns as all of our rights are going </v>

382
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:47.770
<v Speaker 3>to be taken away from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said it far more eloquently and with</v>

383
00:16:47.771 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 3>some better adjectives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

384
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:52.120
<v Speaker 3>but I thought it was a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting point that our,</v>

385
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.313
<v Speaker 3>our eye is not on the prize in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not focusing on what's really </v>

386
00:16:58.271 --> 00:16:59.104
<v Speaker 3>important and we're worried about things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are not to say trans gender rights </v>

387
00:17:04.331 --> 00:17:07.570
<v Speaker 3>aren't important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not the big picture stuff.</v>

388
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.510
<v Speaker 3>How important is all of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Focusing on the right things?</v>

389
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

390
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people can be interested in whatever</v>

391
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:15.824
<v Speaker 2>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also have the right to tell him I </v>

392
00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:22.151
<v Speaker 2>think they're wasting their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm agender pronouns.</v>

393
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.440
<v Speaker 2>All of this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

394
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.660
<v Speaker 2>this is there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

395
00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 2>behind all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something very strange.</v>

396
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:30.990
<v Speaker 2>I started to notice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

397
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.470
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

398
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.280
<v Speaker 2>all of the fascinating things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

399
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.430
<v Speaker 2>one of the ones that interest me most is</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you get this,</v>

400
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.293
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this introduction to almost every </v>

401
00:17:40.011 --> 00:17:45.011
<v Speaker 2>discussion is if we as human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorta solvable things,</v>

402
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.073
<v Speaker 2>I find this fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the Trans stuff is you identify </v>

403
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:55.230
<v Speaker 2>that you're the wrong gender at an early</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

404
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very suspicious about all that.</v>

405
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:58.170
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

406
00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.333
<v Speaker 2>I think can think of a lot of a feminine</v>
<v Speaker 2>young men who shouldn't have drugs even </v>

407
00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 2>encouraged towards them.</v>

408
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say that you mean you're </v>

409
00:18:08.141 --> 00:18:08.974
<v Speaker 3>suspicious of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the way we're treating them or have </v>

410
00:18:11.021 --> 00:18:12.440
<v Speaker 3>the sort of psychological</v>

411
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 2>psych,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychological thing in general,</v>

412
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:16.014
<v Speaker 2>but let's say in a case when somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually does genuinely feel that they </v>

413
00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:21.820
<v Speaker 2>are in the wrong body and that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just this awful thing in it.</v>

414
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.080
<v Speaker 2>As in so many other discussions at </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment of.</v>

415
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.180
<v Speaker 2>And if you mix that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

416
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.420
<v Speaker 2>be on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be right.</v>

417
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

418
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:33.121
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

419
00:18:33.121 --> 00:18:35.430
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you sort that out,</v>

420
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.570
<v Speaker 2>you'll face all the same problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else faces in their lives.</v>

421
00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 2>And maybe some new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

422
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

423
00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:43.554
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear this in the race discussion in </v>

424
00:18:45.271 --> 00:18:46.104
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear it in the gay discussion in </v>

425
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:48.920
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

426
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 2>in a whole set of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as if it's as if,</v>

427
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 2>if we get the formula right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

428
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.843
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think this is a fascinating </v>

429
00:18:56.791 --> 00:18:58.440
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

430
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we live our lives as </v>
<v Speaker 2>solved or solvable beings and um,</v>

431
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:06.443
<v Speaker 2>and we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are engaged as me in ticketing in </v>

432
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:10.704
<v Speaker 2>this society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America in this strange attempt to </v>

433
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:15.450
<v Speaker 2>sort of get it the minute shy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

434
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.320
<v Speaker 2>And apart from being deeply navel </v>
<v Speaker 2>gazing,</v>

435
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:20.963
<v Speaker 2>it seems likely to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we may be missing all the really </v>

436
00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:26.364
<v Speaker 2>important things that are going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will have this sort of haunting view </v>

437
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:29.964
<v Speaker 2>always that we all feel like we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>really sorted out every aspect of Lgbtq </v>

438
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:40.490
<v Speaker 2>rights just as China becomes the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important power in the world.</v>

439
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>

440
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

441
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.620
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a fascinating piece because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was gonna ask.</v>

442
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.660
<v Speaker 3>I was going to talk a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this at the end,</v>

443
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:51.853
<v Speaker 3>but you're gay and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked you in our last interview right </v>

444
00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:56.540
<v Speaker 3>at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by that fact alone,</v>

445
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:57.463
<v Speaker 3>how much does that give you an extra </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity to all of the other things </v>

446
00:20:02.211 --> 00:20:04.460
<v Speaker 3>that you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a vested interest.</v>

447
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.310
<v Speaker 3>You and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think all of us,</v>

448
00:20:07.311 --> 00:20:08.144
<v Speaker 3>I think all humans altogether have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vested interest in keeping the West </v>

449
00:20:10.551 --> 00:20:13.580
<v Speaker 3>arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think as a gay person,</v>

450
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:14.743
<v Speaker 3>it's particularly important that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last places of tolerance in western </v>

451
00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:20.060
<v Speaker 3>thought are kept alive.</v>

452
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say my own case.</v>

453
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:24.000
<v Speaker 2>That's not particularly a galvanizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

454
00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

455
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.813
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think being gay is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>boring as a subject in a way because </v>

456
00:20:29.611 --> 00:20:32.880
<v Speaker 2>certainly for my generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we sort of came out,</v>

457
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.773
<v Speaker 2>came out and buy your $20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who wants to keep going on about that a </v>

458
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.870
<v Speaker 2>little bit and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why people did before.</v>

459
00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:40.704
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you is not a career or life as it were </v>

460
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:47.070
<v Speaker 2>and just being a gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

461
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.570
<v Speaker 2>not a full time occupation.</v>

462
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:49.403
<v Speaker 1>Only so many of us can be in reality TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>know there's only so many fashion gigs </v>

463
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:56.290
<v Speaker 1>on Bravo and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

464
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 1>so I've never,</v>

465
00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:58.733
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never particularly influenced by </v>

466
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.910
<v Speaker 2>politics and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may have said this to you before,</v>

467
00:21:02.911 --> 00:21:03.500
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

468
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm generally very opposed to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>of politics being about what am I,</v>

469
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.490
<v Speaker 2>myself and how can I get the world to </v>
<v Speaker 2>most accommodate itself towards me.</v>

470
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.013
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a mistake having politics </v>

471
00:21:15.811 --> 00:21:16.644
<v Speaker 2>should be a search for some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth or the best arrangement that </v>

472
00:21:20.221 --> 00:21:23.490
<v Speaker 2>allows the truth to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

473
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.660
<v Speaker 2>your own involvement in either your </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfort in it is of importance,</v>

474
00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:29.090
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

475
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.933
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want somebody to say I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally into this because I'm fighting </v>

476
00:21:31.711 --> 00:21:32.910
<v Speaker 2>for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

477
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:33.811
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

478
00:21:33.811 --> 00:21:34.644
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since you mentioned it on some of this </v>

479
00:21:35.641 --> 00:21:37.110
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Islam stuff,</v>

480
00:21:37.111 --> 00:21:37.944
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the first warning sign to me </v>

481
00:21:39.601 --> 00:21:43.110
<v Speaker 2>was not a treatment of gays was dreamed </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Jews,</v>

482
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.320
<v Speaker 2>which I became sort of increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticing there was a problem a couple of</v>

483
00:21:48.361 --> 00:21:49.420
<v Speaker 2>decades ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

484
00:21:49.421 --> 00:21:51.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was that,</v>

485
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.790
<v Speaker 1>how are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you seeing in British system?</v>

486
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was worried about it because</v>

487
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.193
<v Speaker 2>started to notice that there were things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were being said that I thought </v>

488
00:21:59.341 --> 00:22:03.810
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't come around again and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not Jewish myself,</v>

489
00:22:03.811 --> 00:22:06.450
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can notice these things and um,</v>

490
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.570
<v Speaker 2>and not need to as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a personal vested interest in,</v>

491
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.521
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

492
00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:13.354
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to one other thing I'd say </v>

493
00:22:15.811 --> 00:22:18.060
<v Speaker 2>about is I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I generally think,</v>

494
00:22:18.061 --> 00:22:18.894
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the atomization of society into groups </v>

495
00:22:21.271 --> 00:22:24.090
<v Speaker 2>with different interests is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that's causing the,</v>

496
00:22:24.091 --> 00:22:27.660
<v Speaker 2>all this mess in America at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

497
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.093
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why the job of gays should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be just to sort of fight for the gays </v>

498
00:22:33.031 --> 00:22:35.010
<v Speaker 2>and the job of the Jews would be a fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Jews and,</v>

499
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.070
<v Speaker 2>and so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

500
00:22:37.071 --> 00:22:39.840
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea was sort of looking out</v>

501
00:22:39.841 --> 00:22:42.540
<v Speaker 2>for each other's shortly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point in a republic.</v>

502
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.750
<v Speaker 2>And yet that point seems to be lost,</v>

503
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that where this,</v>

504
00:22:47.191 --> 00:22:51.950
<v Speaker 1>this intersectional crew has really lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because they are sort of getting what</v>

505
00:22:51.951 --> 00:22:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that we should be looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>out for each other that should bring all</v>

506
00:22:55.401 --> 00:22:59.360
<v Speaker 1>of these minority groups together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except instead of that they're vying for</v>

507
00:22:59.361 --> 00:23:00.510
<v Speaker 1>most depressed,</v>

508
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.093
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most ridiculous and most </v>

509
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:07.930
<v Speaker 2>hyperventilating and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the intersectionality people,</v>

510
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:08.764
<v Speaker 2>I mean the two big things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is they are the prime culprits of </v>

511
00:23:12.031 --> 00:23:14.140
<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the myth of Solvability,</v>

512
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.430
<v Speaker 2>the myth of humans eligibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we just,</v>

513
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.430
<v Speaker 2>if we get the Rubik's cube right and </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

514
00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:21.280
<v Speaker 2>the Games get that and then we get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>traumas and then the people to hand them</v>

515
00:23:21.281 --> 00:23:22.600
<v Speaker 2>the nonbinary in this and</v>

516
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.753
<v Speaker 1>exactly think exactly the same and speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>in exactly the preferential order that </v>

517
00:23:30.631 --> 00:23:32.400
<v Speaker 1>we're loud speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will all be fine.</v>

518
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.263
<v Speaker 1>Whereas my view is you'll still have </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single problem of the world ahead </v>

519
00:23:35.761 --> 00:23:36.594
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll still have to work out what your </v>

520
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:41.370
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A whole load of stuff is coming.</v>

521
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.480
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

522
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.373
<v Speaker 1>that's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the second thing is they are </v>

523
00:23:44.701 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 1>obviously apart</v>

524
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.873
<v Speaker 2>in American society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's too much of an </v>

525
00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:49.574
<v Speaker 2>exaggeration because they started at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities and it's trickling across </v>

526
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:53.264
<v Speaker 2>everything else and I've been having </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting conversations with </v>

527
00:23:56.361 --> 00:23:57.194
<v Speaker 2>people about this in recent years in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe as well as in America and one of </v>

528
00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:03.134
<v Speaker 2>the things I'm sort of slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>confident about here in America is it </v>

529
00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:09.770
<v Speaker 2>you do have an answer to it and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer you've had before.</v>

530
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:10.604
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem of the identity politics </v>

531
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:17.021
<v Speaker 2>thing is we're already starting to see a</v>
<v Speaker 2>the apart from being wrong in itself and</v>

532
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I think morally suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm selfish.</v>

533
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 2>You can't stop what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create on it.</v>

534
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.910
<v Speaker 2>You can't have racial rights for every </v>
<v Speaker 2>group and racial pride rights,</v>

535
00:24:28.911 --> 00:24:32.870
<v Speaker 2>every group and always hold back white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

536
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 2>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

537
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.840
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't.</v>

538
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:36.674
<v Speaker 2>At some point it's going to break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't keep bashing heterosexual men </v>

539
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.503
<v Speaker 2>and not expect at some point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be some kind of </v>

540
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

541
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 2>So if everyone's allowed their group </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from the majority or whatever,</v>

542
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:50.474
<v Speaker 2>then at some point that's going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty and I can see it coming so </v>

543
00:24:53.211 --> 00:24:54.044
<v Speaker 2>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see it now and it's already started </v>

544
00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.300
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is that in America you had the</v>

545
00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:05.830
<v Speaker 2>answer to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what Tocqueville a mentioned.</v>

546
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.200
<v Speaker 2>It's the deal of being in the republic </v>
<v Speaker 2>is you don't do that.</v>

547
00:25:09.201 --> 00:25:12.290
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you deal with each other face to face to</v>

548
00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:16.850
<v Speaker 2>face as a citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

549
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.300
<v Speaker 2>you don't do it as just people coming to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hawk,</v>

550
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:24.450
<v Speaker 2>something in the marketplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but face to faces,</v>

551
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.720
<v Speaker 2>individual citizens in the republic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

552
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.540
<v Speaker 2>this is the only way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

553
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:35.000
<v Speaker 2>but I think there will obviously be some</v>
<v Speaker 2>mania before you get back there again.</v>

554
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:36.441
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

555
00:25:36.441 --> 00:25:37.274
<v Speaker 2>you get the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may you get back mainly business our </v>

556
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:41.230
<v Speaker 2>may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

557
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny the way I do the show,</v>

558
00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:43.334
<v Speaker 2>I try not to talk about individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>people too much because I'd always </v>

559
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.150
<v Speaker 2>rather focus on the ideas.</v>

560
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.343
<v Speaker 2>But as you're saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of something very </v>

561
00:25:49.491 --> 00:25:52.210
<v Speaker 2>specifically that Linda Sarsour who I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you're.</v>

562
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.053
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent an evening with us also in </v>

563
00:25:54.171 --> 00:25:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

564
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

565
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd tell you,</v>

566
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
<v Speaker 2>we got on roaring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee and I sent some territory that was a</v>

567
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:07.530
<v Speaker 2>bit of sexual tension in the room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

568
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.200
<v Speaker 2>avoidable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

569
00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:09.871
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

570
00:26:09.871 --> 00:26:11.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact is actually she,</v>

571
00:26:11.691 --> 00:26:12.524
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're asked to debate the CROC fandom </v>

572
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:17.420
<v Speaker 2>word Islamophobia at the Brooklyn Art </v>
<v Speaker 2>Museum.</v>

573
00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:21.170
<v Speaker 2>And I like a challenge and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

574
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.550
<v Speaker 2>I think our mutual friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lion has.</v>

575
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Jada was also meant to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

576
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.610
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

577
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:26.600
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

578
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 2>various things happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The garland shooting happened and it was</v>

579
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:34.730
<v Speaker 2>decided that it wasn't safe a yarn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still did it and things.</v>

580
00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:35.511
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

581
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:36.344
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing that they started off </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the other side sort of giggling </v>

582
00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:40.160
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that they couldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn up,</v>

583
00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:43.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all using it against her and as I</v>

584
00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 2>ions afraid of anybody</v>

585
00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.720
<v Speaker 2>and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say yes.</v>

586
00:26:47.721 --> 00:26:49.860
<v Speaker 2>I encountered him before she became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it were,</v>

587
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:53.790
<v Speaker 2>infamous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought she was a very nasty,</v>

588
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.860
<v Speaker 2>very bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very on America.</v>

589
00:26:56.861 --> 00:26:57.920
<v Speaker 2>And actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

590
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just say that because she,</v>

591
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.293
<v Speaker 2>she knows like all demagogues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to introduce herself and introduced </v>

592
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 2>herself to sort of proud brooklynite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proud American and a proud Palestinian,</v>

593
00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:06.720
<v Speaker 2>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

594
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.720
<v Speaker 2>And I thought an interesting order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was clear that she sort of really</v>

595
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:12.893
<v Speaker 2>hated America or at least hates America </v>
<v Speaker 2>that exists currently because it was me </v>

596
00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Speaker 2>that ended up having to explain to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience that for instance,</v>

597
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 2>the New York police don't just go around</v>
<v Speaker 2>persecuting Muslims,</v>

598
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just willful misrepresentation of,</v>

599
00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.350
<v Speaker 2>of the American authorities at every </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn.</v>

600
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 2>So I thought she was very dishonest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unpleasant.</v>

601
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.880
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean I've come across her type all</v>

602
00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:36.470
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

603
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.303
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only reason I mentioned her is </v>

604
00:27:38.421 --> 00:27:42.120
<v Speaker 3>because of what you said previously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really was about assimilation,</v>

605
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 3>that the whole point of America is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>assimilate.</v>

606
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:45.563
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you saw that speech she </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave about two months ago where she </v>

607
00:27:47.691 --> 00:27:48.524
<v Speaker 3>called for a g high and then suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left was defending the word gi and </v>

608
00:27:51.681 --> 00:27:54.800
<v Speaker 3>the white supremacists in the White </v>
<v Speaker 3>House and all that.</v>

609
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.620
<v Speaker 3>But I thought the key part of it put </v>
<v Speaker 3>jihad aside,</v>

610
00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.040
<v Speaker 3>put white supremacy aside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The key part was when she said,</v>

611
00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:04.460
<v Speaker 3>we're not here to assimilate thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>what a,</v>

612
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.760
<v Speaker 3>that is the antithesis of the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>project,</v>

613
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.890
<v Speaker 3>this amazing melting pot that we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we've done for the most part,</v>

614
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.030
<v Speaker 3>multicultural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

615
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Multiculturalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

616
00:28:14.211 --> 00:28:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Where Europe has failed in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

617
00:28:16.491 --> 00:28:17.900
<v Speaker 3>And she was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

618
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:18.261
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

619
00:28:18.261 --> 00:28:19.094
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that was more dangerous </v>

620
00:28:20.211 --> 00:28:21.170
<v Speaker 3>than the others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

621
00:28:21.171 --> 00:28:21.941
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

622
00:28:21.941 --> 00:28:22.551
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say about him,</v>

623
00:28:22.551 --> 00:28:23.281
<v Speaker 3>he put aside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

624
00:28:23.281 --> 00:28:25.880
<v Speaker 3>The fantastical idea of what she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggesting was,</v>

625
00:28:25.881 --> 00:28:26.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sort of have a,</v>

626
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.200
<v Speaker 3>a jihad by kind of going and just really</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a struggling.</v>

627
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.160
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just struggling in front of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israeli.</v>

628
00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

629
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

630
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:39.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

631
00:28:39.921 --> 00:28:41.720
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I recognize is the night we</v>

632
00:28:41.721 --> 00:28:42.171
<v Speaker 2>met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

633
00:28:42.171 --> 00:28:45.590
<v Speaker 2>she really doesn't like this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

634
00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will have a problem by that.</v>

635
00:28:46.931 --> 00:28:48.710
<v Speaker 2>It was what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do about that.</v>

636
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

637
00:28:50.751 --> 00:28:51.584
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me she's a sort of very </v>
<v Speaker 2>rabid sectarian sort of Palestinian </v>

638
00:28:55.581 --> 00:28:57.470
<v Speaker 2>nationalist who happens to live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn.</v>

639
00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:59.503
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean really what you do about it </v>

640
00:29:02.121 --> 00:29:04.730
<v Speaker 2>is that people identified that recognize</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and called it out 40.</v>

641
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.630
<v Speaker 2>It was what it is and they just aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>very many people to do that.</v>

642
00:29:08.631 --> 00:29:09.670
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

643
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.920
<v Speaker 2>we all take sort of baby steps on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't we know is you say,</v>

644
00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up with a left or defending this</v>

645
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:17.870
<v Speaker 2>and actually why don't you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

646
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:18.763
<v Speaker 2>she's not speaking as a critic of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>society who wants to sort of mildly </v>

647
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:24.733
<v Speaker 2>improve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's speaking as an opponent of our </v>

648
00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:30.950
<v Speaker 2>society because she doesn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I've encountered this,</v>

649
00:29:30.951 --> 00:29:31.784
<v Speaker 2>I say all my life and my opponents and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the very close enemies I've made in </v>

650
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Britain and across Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain type of person of that ilk who</v>

651
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:44.110
<v Speaker 2>clearly as an opponent of the society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like it.</v>

652
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.790
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among other things,</v>

653
00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 2>or you can do is point a to point out </v>
<v Speaker 2>then is to say,</v>

654
00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:50.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing</v>

655
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.340
<v Speaker 3>your hair really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it amazing?</v>

656
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the catch 22 of what we've </v>

657
00:29:56.701 --> 00:29:57.960
<v Speaker 3>got in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

658
00:29:57.961 --> 00:30:00.480
<v Speaker 3>where we're going to have to let in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of voices.</v>

659
00:30:00.481 --> 00:30:01.860
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the beauty of this thing.</v>

660
00:30:01.861 --> 00:30:04.270
<v Speaker 3>And it also creates a little bit of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brand.</v>

661
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.600
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about your book.</v>

662
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.220
<v Speaker 3>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the title,</v>

663
00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.113
<v Speaker 3>the strange death of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought using the adjective strange </v>

664
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.440
<v Speaker 3>was particularly interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't you choose the word strange,</v>

665
00:30:16.441 --> 00:30:21.441
<v Speaker 3>not slow or a series of other things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could have used first is,</v>

666
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:27.000
<v Speaker 2>which not many readers will get to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly known history textbook.</v>

667
00:30:27.001 --> 00:30:28.860
<v Speaker 2>I've got strange death of liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>England,</v>

668
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.873
<v Speaker 2>which described the decline of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberal Party in the early part of the </v>

669
00:30:32.401 --> 00:30:33.690
<v Speaker 2>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's no sort of,</v>

670
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:34.900
<v Speaker 2>isn't needed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

671
00:30:34.901 --> 00:30:35.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

672
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Although there is a slight similarity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

673
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is a really a viral thing.</v>

674
00:30:39.181 --> 00:30:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just.</v>

675
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.240
<v Speaker 2>It is odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

676
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a curious way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

677
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.190
<v Speaker 2>and I think if you'd have said to anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>have one or two generations ago,</v>

678
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.860
<v Speaker 2>this will be what Europe's issues would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the 21st century that basically it</v>

679
00:30:55.861 --> 00:30:56.694
<v Speaker 2>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't find any way not to just allow </v>

680
00:31:00.001 --> 00:31:03.910
<v Speaker 2>the world to walk in and join them that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

681
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.333
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those generations would have been </v>

682
00:31:06.061 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 2>surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

683
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:10.350
<v Speaker 2>so yes it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is strange.</v>

684
00:31:10.351 --> 00:31:12.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I tried to explain why and I,</v>

685
00:31:12.651 --> 00:31:15.300
<v Speaker 2>and in order to explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to explain it from not just from</v>

686
00:31:15.301 --> 00:31:16.170
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

687
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.680
<v Speaker 2>the sort of firsthand accounts and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics and all that sort of thing,</v>

688
00:31:19.681 --> 00:31:22.470
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the deeper philosophical reasons why</v>

689
00:31:22.471 --> 00:31:23.304
<v Speaker 2>this is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's lots of books do bits of </v>

690
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.090
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to just say,</v>

691
00:31:30.091 --> 00:31:31.890
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the whole overall picture.</v>

692
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.723
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're actually living </v>

693
00:31:34.321 --> 00:31:36.240
<v Speaker 2>through and this is why.</v>

694
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.263
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the subtitle is immigration identity </v>

695
00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:42.680
<v Speaker 3>and Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

696
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.840
<v Speaker 3>does that order have any meaning to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the way you phrase those?</v>

697
00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:47.400
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

698
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:47.961
<v Speaker 2>Kelly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

699
00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:48.794
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it centers on the 2015 migration crisis </v>

700
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.320
<v Speaker 2>when Angela Merkel opened the doors of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe and,</v>

701
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:55.803
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't really find a way to shut them </v>

702
00:31:56.751 --> 00:31:57.750
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

703
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.630
<v Speaker 2>but they'd already been open for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time as I explained.</v>

704
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:03.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

705
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

706
00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.380
<v Speaker 2>these are the three massive things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

707
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.233
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

708
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.310
<v Speaker 2>that are preoccupying I think not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>

709
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Europeans at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the immigration crisis,</v>

710
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.150
<v Speaker 2>whether publics of Europe just wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop all across the continent.</v>

711
00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:21.710
<v Speaker 2>All the polls all show the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The public wanted to slow down or stop.</v>

712
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the immigration better at the,</v>

713
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity bit of it is a very,</v>

714
00:32:27.741 --> 00:32:29.120
<v Speaker 2>very painful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>

715
00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:29.954
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people aren't very good at talking </v>

716
00:32:31.191 --> 00:32:32.930
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm not very good at talking about</v>

717
00:32:32.931 --> 00:32:33.764
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's just their underlying </v>

718
00:32:35.121 --> 00:32:37.430
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this thing?</v>

719
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 2>What is it a European who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can be European?</v>

720
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.333
<v Speaker 2>Can anyone be a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is Europe a home for the people </v>

721
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.093
<v Speaker 2>who've been in Europe or is it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone in the world he wants to move in </v>

722
00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:54.890
<v Speaker 2>and call it home is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very big question.</v>

723
00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:56.043
<v Speaker 2>These are big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the third one of that is the </v>

724
00:32:57.471 --> 00:32:58.304
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but which I mentioned because it's </v>

725
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:03.040
<v Speaker 2>obviously the sharp has specified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

726
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.820
<v Speaker 2>you can have somebody move in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you can have a Nigerian Christian</v>

727
00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:10.040
<v Speaker 2>move into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

728
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.943
<v Speaker 2>a bit of the south of England and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will have issues I bring as </v>

729
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:14.804
<v Speaker 2>everyone does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will have their own ideas as </v>

730
00:33:15.681 --> 00:33:16.514
<v Speaker 2>everyone does their own culture that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've walked in from and everyone </v>

731
00:33:19.101 --> 00:33:20.400
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

732
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.540
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

733
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.423
<v Speaker 2>it would be the person of another </v>
<v Speaker 2>background for another community and </v>

734
00:33:27.191 --> 00:33:32.191
<v Speaker 2>another faith who would be coming in </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the issues that are really starting</v>

735
00:33:33.081 --> 00:33:34.520
<v Speaker 2>to northern Europe.</v>

736
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.200
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

737
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:39.670
<v Speaker 2>we find this very hard to talk about and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

738
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.120
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

739
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.530
<v Speaker 2>it's getting easier very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very slowly.</v>

740
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.881
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

741
00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Speaker 2>our big worry is we've not been great on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the integration.</v>

742
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.263
<v Speaker 2>All of our leaders say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the European politicians admit this </v>

743
00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:55.610
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bit that is worrying us is Islam</v>

744
00:33:55.611 --> 00:33:56.444
<v Speaker 2>bit because I think there's now a </v>
<v Speaker 2>general awareness that may be this is </v>

745
00:33:59.391 --> 00:34:00.224
<v Speaker 2>the bit we can't digest or we're finding</v>
<v Speaker 2>it unusually difficult to digest and </v>

746
00:34:06.741 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 2>incorporate A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't say it's impossible by the way.</v>

747
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:11.054
<v Speaker 2>I just think for all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's proving very hard in May in the </v>

748
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.680
<v Speaker 2>years ahead proved far worse.</v>

749
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.800
<v Speaker 3>So I know that you often make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinction like most educated people,</v>

750
00:34:20.841 --> 00:34:23.960
<v Speaker 3>you make the distinction between Islam </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a set of ideas,</v>

751
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:28.670
<v Speaker 3>as any religion is simply a set of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus Muslim as as possible.</v>

752
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:29.923
<v Speaker 3>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that there is something </v>

753
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:33.344
<v Speaker 3>unique?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is always what triggers my </v>

754
00:34:34.611 --> 00:34:35.444
<v Speaker 3>friends on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you say that there is something </v>

755
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:41.741
<v Speaker 3>unique about the set of ideas of Islam </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is different than the set of ideas.</v>

756
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:46.100
<v Speaker 3>If we just take the big three </v>
<v Speaker 3>monotheistic once that is different than</v>

757
00:34:46.101 --> 00:34:46.934
<v Speaker 3>the set of ideas of Judaism or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity or at least how their </v>

758
00:34:49.881 --> 00:34:50.714
<v Speaker 3>practice I think is the more operative </v>
<v Speaker 3>part because you can look through all </v>

759
00:34:53.331 --> 00:34:55.410
<v Speaker 3>the books and there's plenty of bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff in the old testament.</v>

760
00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

761
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.870
<v Speaker 3>do you at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of this,</v>

762
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:00.704
<v Speaker 3>do you believe that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>incompatible that this set of ideas is </v>

763
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 3>incompatible with the set of ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the west is trying to preserve?</v>

764
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think unreformed Islam presents a very</v>

765
00:35:12.791 --> 00:35:17.190
<v Speaker 2>significant values challenge and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not reconcilable if,</v>

766
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.580
<v Speaker 2>if we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it were,</v>

767
00:35:18.581 --> 00:35:19.990
<v Speaker 2>the Islam of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

768
00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:25.050
<v Speaker 2>most Muslim countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to see how that's doable.</v>

769
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

770
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I think all of this is very painful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

771
00:35:30.551 --> 00:35:31.384
<v Speaker 2>Because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in any case in an age of </v>

772
00:35:32.831 --> 00:35:36.490
<v Speaker 2>relativism already were for perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>good reasons.</v>

773
00:35:36.491 --> 00:35:37.091
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

774
00:35:37.091 --> 00:35:38.910
<v Speaker 2>we sort of pretend there's all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>

775
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:39.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

776
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.360
<v Speaker 2>I might be a Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

777
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.223
<v Speaker 2>you might be a Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she does yoga and it all comes out in </v>

778
00:35:47.281 --> 00:35:48.114
<v Speaker 2>the wash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much the same and I just think </v>

779
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:52.020
<v Speaker 2>that to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously not true.</v>

780
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:52.854
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's very strange to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to want to concentrate on everything </v>

781
00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.180
<v Speaker 2>other than the premises and origins of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>belief structure.</v>

782
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as I've often said,</v>

783
00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:04.340
<v Speaker 2>stop me if I've said this to you before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

784
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:05.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are all sorts of problems in the </v>

785
00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Christian religion and in Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

786
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:11.310
<v Speaker 2>but as I've often said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

787
00:36:11.311 --> 00:36:15.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm just carrying out the thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment that instead of getting up at</v>

788
00:36:15.421 --> 00:36:16.800
<v Speaker 2>the sermon on the mount and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

789
00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:18.390
<v Speaker 2>love they neighbor and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgive me,</v>

790
00:36:18.391 --> 00:36:19.050
<v Speaker 2>we're endlessly.</v>

791
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Jesus had said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your brother offends you,</v>

792
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:22.194
<v Speaker 2>chop his head off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would Christianity's history have been </v>

793
00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:24.864
<v Speaker 2>more bloody or less bloody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we'd all agree it's going to be </v>

794
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:29.090
<v Speaker 2>more and find the job behind the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

795
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:29.933
<v Speaker 2>if Jesus had gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if Jesus had gone into the whole </v>

796
00:36:34.381 --> 00:36:34.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

797
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:36.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the behind the train slaughter him,</v>

798
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the context,</v>

799
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.453
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there would be even more </v>

800
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Christian antisemitism and then there </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been historically.</v>

801
00:36:50.821 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 2>So I just think these things matter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this is very,</v>

802
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:59.130
<v Speaker 2>very painful for reasons that I go in </v>
<v Speaker 2>during some depth in the book,</v>

803
00:36:59.131 --> 00:37:03.000
<v Speaker 2>which is that in recent years we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in countries like Britain and I think in</v>

804
00:37:03.001 --> 00:37:07.400
<v Speaker 2>America have had the luxury of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>describing ourselves in terms of,</v>

805
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.580
<v Speaker 2>among other things have been universal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we have,</v>

806
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.140
<v Speaker 2>it should also be universal.</v>

807
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:13.973
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a very big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is always a debate within </v>

808
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.090
<v Speaker 2>liberalism of course is liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something we have or something we,</v>

809
00:37:18.091 --> 00:37:19.450
<v Speaker 2>as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expound and,</v>

810
00:37:19.451 --> 00:37:20.284
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

811
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.620
<v Speaker 2>and expand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

812
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.873
<v Speaker 2>and in recent years I think that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain moroseness has landed across </v>

813
00:37:28.711 --> 00:37:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among other things,</v>

814
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of a growing awareness.</v>

815
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:34.523
<v Speaker 2>Maybe what we have is very unusual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have become disassociated from </v>

816
00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:46.071
<v Speaker 2>the roots in which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we enjoy a group and this,</v>

817
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.470
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

818
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:48.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>German uh,</v>

819
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal ferris,</v>

820
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:50.934
<v Speaker 2>I quote in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who puts this as one of the central </v>

821
00:37:53.341 --> 00:37:55.200
<v Speaker 2>conundrum for Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible?</v>

822
00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:56.843
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible that the thing we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoying and living through a can </v>

823
00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 2>survive without the connection to its </v>
<v Speaker 2>roots?</v>

824
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.510
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the roots of the West and</v>

825
00:38:06.511 --> 00:38:11.511
<v Speaker 2>of Europe in particular fairly clear and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a combination of things.</v>

826
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.000
<v Speaker 2>It's the inheritance from ancient Greece</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ancient Rome.</v>

827
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:16.463
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously the inheritance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian civilization that washed </v>

828
00:38:18.991 --> 00:38:20.370
<v Speaker 2>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the continent.</v>

829
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.773
<v Speaker 2>And then the refining fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enlightenments and skepticism and </v>

830
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.823
<v Speaker 2>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course we would go on endlessly </v>

831
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:28.890
<v Speaker 2>about the other things that have added </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

832
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:32.070
<v Speaker 2>But broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is what made Europe Europe and what</v>

833
00:38:32.071 --> 00:38:34.880
<v Speaker 2>made a European a European.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They breathe this,</v>

834
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.793
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

835
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

836
00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.713
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the sort of the last man at the end </v>

837
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:44.200
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I fear modern Europeans are,</v>

838
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.053
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in this strange position of I'm </v>

839
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:52.390
<v Speaker 2>finding it hard to even identify where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he and she has coming from,</v>

840
00:38:52.391 --> 00:38:56.260
<v Speaker 2>let alone being able to return to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>roots and nurture them.</v>

841
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Because we all have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

842
00:38:57.791 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have a conflicted set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>views about this,</v>

843
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

844
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:08.400
<v Speaker 2>is it necessary for other people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe those of us who had,</v>

845
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.263
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have sometimes been tempted to hope </v>

846
00:39:10.901 --> 00:39:11.711
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

847
00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:12.544
<v Speaker 2>skepticism is enough constantly a </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed by the discovery that for </v>

848
00:39:17.351 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody may be a free thinker about God</v>

849
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.010
<v Speaker 2>and that's it for free thinking point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

850
00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From then on it's tribal away and um,</v>

851
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all,</v>

852
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.320
<v Speaker 2>we're all living through this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's for Europe.</v>

853
00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:33.154
<v Speaker 2>I think that the combination of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically unprecedented move into </v>

854
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:38.254
<v Speaker 2>people in the continent at the same time</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this sort of breakdown of what we </v>

855
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:46.930
<v Speaker 2>are ourselves is going on is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fatal,</v>

856
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:47.913
<v Speaker 2>fatal thing.</v>

857
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:50.560
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot there that I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit.</v>

858
00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 3>But I was what you said right at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>

859
00:39:52.571 --> 00:39:57.040
<v Speaker 3>which is that if Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if unreformed or not allowed to reform.</v>

860
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.110
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting for the space that you and I</v>

861
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 3>sort of exist in because I've many </v>
<v Speaker 3>allies who are reformers.</v>

862
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm not just so I have allies that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>ex Muslim,</v>

863
00:40:09.251 --> 00:40:10.084
<v Speaker 3>I have allies that are Muslim and many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people that I've interviewed that </v>

864
00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:15.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're are treated horribly,</v>

865
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.073
<v Speaker 3>horribly and there and every time </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're allowed to get a platform or </v>

866
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.533
<v Speaker 3>it's actually by the evil conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>were all the things that people who </v>

867
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:27.274
<v Speaker 3>don't like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll say about me or say about you or </v>

868
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:32.190
<v Speaker 3>any of that stuff that makes the job a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good jillion times harder.</v>

869
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:33.303
<v Speaker 2>I say in the book towards the end when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to rouse myself some </v>

870
00:40:35.741 --> 00:40:39.970
<v Speaker 2>prognostications about all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is the worst possible sign.</v>

871
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.003
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just that the people that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>might talk about in these terms are so </v>

872
00:40:45.131 --> 00:40:45.964
<v Speaker 2>few and between us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I might have them in our phone </v>

873
00:40:48.941 --> 00:40:51.640
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just that,</v>

874
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.350
<v Speaker 2>but who were the ones that are most </v>
<v Speaker 2>under,</v>

875
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.490
<v Speaker 2>under pressure and under risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really are the,</v>

876
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:03.540
<v Speaker 2>they're the good guys to say that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a tragedy for Islam is obvious,</v>

877
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.553
<v Speaker 2>but he's always been my view that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should try to avoid making ourselves a </v>

878
00:41:08.891 --> 00:41:11.050
<v Speaker 2>casualty of Islams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil,</v>

879
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 2>internal strife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

880
00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:14.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we haven't done that.</v>

881
00:41:14.651 --> 00:41:15.484
<v Speaker 2>I think we've spent recent decades </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost deliberately running towards the </v>

882
00:41:17.921 --> 00:41:18.754
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't need to involve us so that the </v>

883
00:41:21.401 --> 00:41:24.730
<v Speaker 2>tragedy of Islam becomes the tragedy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the West as well.</v>

884
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I hope this could be avoided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it calmed.</v>

885
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.833
<v Speaker 2>And I think that as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst possible sign for the future </v>

886
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 2>is that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

887
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:34.303
<v Speaker 2>having dabbled summit in Germany who </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives under protection measure no wise </v>

888
00:41:37.701 --> 00:41:38.534
<v Speaker 2>who comes in for the grief in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a young cle who followed the Dutch </v>

889
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:46.520
<v Speaker 2>integration ideal more than anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>ends up having to leave Holland.</v>

890
00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.280
<v Speaker 2>These are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bad signs,</v>

891
00:41:49.281 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still live openly as a,</v>

892
00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hammer has military commander in London.</v>

893
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Your life's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be celebrated in some ways,</v>

894
00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a huge trump.</v>

895
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:00.253
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>

896
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.213
<v Speaker 2>let's knock out each one of these words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've sort of hit that I think a bit of </v>

897
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:04.574
<v Speaker 2>each one already on the immigration </v>
<v Speaker 2>front when you said that Merkel just </v>

898
00:42:07.761 --> 00:42:08.660
<v Speaker 2>opened the doors.</v>

899
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I see a lot of different stuff written </v>
<v Speaker 2>about her that she either intentionally,</v>

900
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:15.164
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get sort of the conspiracy people </v>

901
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:17.204
<v Speaker 2>that she wanted to destroy Europe or she</v>
<v Speaker 2>hates her own country and all this </v>

902
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:22.130
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try not to impune everyone's motives,</v>

903
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.203
<v Speaker 2>but when this happened in 2015 and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this combination of refugees and </v>

904
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:31.640
<v Speaker 2>immigrants and migrants and nobody could</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what was happening and we saw</v>

905
00:42:31.641 --> 00:42:32.474
<v Speaker 2>videos of people just thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people just running across borders and </v>

906
00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:36.374
<v Speaker 2>all of this stuff and an odd amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that seemed to be men in their </v>

907
00:42:38.481 --> 00:42:40.550
<v Speaker 2>twenties and not women and children and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

908
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:45.820
<v Speaker 2>which implies that they're often </v>
<v Speaker 2>migrants looking for work and figures in</v>

909
00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.213
<v Speaker 2>the front takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The majority of the people became in </v>

910
00:42:48.681 --> 00:42:51.470
<v Speaker 2>2015 have no right to be in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

911
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:52.880
<v Speaker 2>which is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somehow,</v>

912
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:55.280
<v Speaker 2>even if you say that you'll be labeled </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

913
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:59.030
<v Speaker 2>but what do you think her intention was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2015?</v>

914
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.550
<v Speaker 2>This is why I tried to go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>

915
00:43:01.551 --> 00:43:04.370
<v Speaker 2>not just with history but also with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy on this.</v>

916
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't impute,</v>

917
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible motives to her.</v>

918
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I think she was blackmailed by history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was facing a truly terrible humanitarian</v>

919
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.173
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was undoubtedly going on and I </v>

920
00:43:18.881 --> 00:43:22.160
<v Speaker 2>said this in the face and I travel </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and speak to many,</v>

921
00:43:22.161 --> 00:43:22.994
<v Speaker 2>many migrants from all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to many of the countries they </v>

922
00:43:25.011 --> 00:43:25.844
<v Speaker 2>fled from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also go to speak to them in the </v>

923
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:31.610
<v Speaker 2>countries that they arrive into and </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak to them in the camps and certainly</v>

924
00:43:31.611 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 2>have met and listened to more migrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think any of my critics,</v>

925
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

926
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

927
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:38.893
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

928
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.240
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

929
00:43:40.241 --> 00:43:41.074
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to exaggerate the ease of the situation </v>

930
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.950
<v Speaker 2>that she faced or the ease of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution to it.</v>

931
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:47.570
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that shouldn't be done.</v>

932
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:48.973
<v Speaker 2>It was a genuine crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It remains a genuine crisis and the </v>

933
00:43:50.931 --> 00:43:54.740
<v Speaker 2>biggest imaginable moral question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

934
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.113
<v Speaker 2>so we also know that at the moment that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she made the decision in 2015 to </v>

935
00:44:01.191 --> 00:44:04.430
<v Speaker 2>basically suspend all border controls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

936
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I suggested in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but since my book has come out,</v>

937
00:44:08.211 --> 00:44:09.044
<v Speaker 2>it's already now being confirmed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who was with her at the time </v>

938
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:14.540
<v Speaker 2>that what happened and in particular was</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody said to Merkel,</v>

939
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.393
<v Speaker 2>we cannot have German border guards </v>
<v Speaker 2>repelling migrants and the photos go </v>

940
00:44:20.781 --> 00:44:21.760
<v Speaker 2>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

941
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.340
<v Speaker 2>So this is just condemned because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

942
00:44:25.341 --> 00:44:26.174
<v Speaker 2>It's what is what a one friends for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the second career of adult </v>

943
00:44:29.331 --> 00:44:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an ugly way of looking at it,</v>

944
00:44:32.671 --> 00:44:35.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not entirely implausible.</v>

945
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

946
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 2>this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is another go around this terrible,</v>

947
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:41.610
<v Speaker 2>terrible history and past.</v>

948
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.650
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

949
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not conspiracy.</v>

950
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I show in the book how much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more what we call in England,</v>

951
00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:51.723
<v Speaker 2>cockup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always tended towards a cookout </v>

952
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.750
<v Speaker 2>view of history because if you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics up close as I have done quite a</v>

953
00:44:57.751 --> 00:44:59.580
<v Speaker 2>bit throughout my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

954
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not really people pursuing </v>

955
00:45:02.371 --> 00:45:04.860
<v Speaker 2>grant sort of schemes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

956
00:45:04.861 --> 00:45:08.700
<v Speaker 2>It's people who haven't done the job </v>
<v Speaker 2>before because you can't and there is no</v>

957
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:11.340
<v Speaker 2>qualification that gets you in position </v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand.</v>

958
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:12.683
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to deal with not longterm </v>

959
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.343
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but tomorrow morning's headlines and </v>

960
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.810
<v Speaker 2>media reaction the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

961
00:45:20.811 --> 00:45:21.644
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

962
00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:25.170
<v Speaker 2>they drowned below the surface of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>babble.</v>

963
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.260
<v Speaker 2>That's how politics happens these days.</v>

964
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:29.203
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is not the way that both sides </v>

965
00:45:30.591 --> 00:45:34.190
<v Speaker 3>talk about politics they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to make it seem like the other</v>

966
00:45:34.191 --> 00:45:39.191
<v Speaker 3>side has constantly this grand plan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's going according to plan.</v>

967
00:45:40.101 --> 00:45:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Or as I said in the book,</v>

968
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.073
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single thing we thought would </v>

969
00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:45.074
<v Speaker 2>happen didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nothing that has happened was </v>

970
00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:51.590
<v Speaker 2>expected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go back to the fifties,</v>

971
00:45:51.591 --> 00:45:52.424
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guest workers who were the first </v>

972
00:45:53.331 --> 00:45:54.164
<v Speaker 2>people who came in after the war of </v>
<v Speaker 2>first migrant waves into Europe from </v>

973
00:45:58.071 --> 00:46:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Turkey and elsewhere as Merkel herself </v>
<v Speaker 2>said in 2010,</v>

974
00:46:02.181 --> 00:46:06.160
<v Speaker 2>we expected them to go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible mockup.</v>

975
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

976
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:08.780
<v Speaker 2>but then we expect them to go ahead and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it didn't.</v>

977
00:46:08.781 --> 00:46:09.230
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

978
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:10.063
<v Speaker 2>they wanted having tasted first world </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics and among other things they </v>

979
00:46:14.211 --> 00:46:15.920
<v Speaker 2>wanted to bring their families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

980
00:46:15.921 --> 00:46:16.754
<v Speaker 2>and if you have your families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have children and you enter the </v>

981
00:46:17.991 --> 00:46:20.410
<v Speaker 2>schooling system and then you'll need </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare and then you'll need it isn't</v>

982
00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.010
<v Speaker 2>element,</v>

983
00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.080
<v Speaker 3>especially if the state's giving you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of those things.</v>

984
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.650
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why we are where we are,</v>

985
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:26.870
<v Speaker 2>where we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

986
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

987
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:28.771
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

988
00:46:28.771 --> 00:46:29.604
<v Speaker 2>the 2011 census identified people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>call themselves white British on the </v>

989
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:33.624
<v Speaker 2>sensors as a minority in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minority in 23 out of 33 London </v>

990
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:40.990
<v Speaker 2>burroughs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why all the demographic projections</v>

991
00:46:40.991 --> 00:46:43.070
<v Speaker 2>from across the continent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

992
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.630
<v Speaker 2>show Europeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

993
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:46.464
<v Speaker 2>I think not to overstate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing the place they had to call home </v>

994
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.750
<v Speaker 2>or at least becoming a minority in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

995
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some people talk about that in</v>

996
00:46:54.231 --> 00:46:56.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sort of language of a,</v>

997
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Haha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the empire strikes back,</v>

998
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:58.833
<v Speaker 2>now you're getting a taste of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went round the world and now the </v>

999
00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:03.690
<v Speaker 2>world's come to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1000
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.910
<v Speaker 2>among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I warn those people,</v>

1001
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:08.850
<v Speaker 2>just be careful of that language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the language of punishment.</v>

1002
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Because if the language of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it were,</v>

1003
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:14.603
<v Speaker 2>the punishment for colonialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then down the road you'll create a </v>

1004
00:47:17.371 --> 00:47:18.390
<v Speaker 2>movement will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1005
00:47:18.391 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 2>we managed to end colonialism.</v>

1006
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'll come for you to no </v>

1007
00:47:23.361 --> 00:47:26.900
<v Speaker 3>matter no matter what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with that being said,</v>

1008
00:47:26.901 --> 00:47:31.901
<v Speaker 3>so the identity part then is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really inextricably linked to this.</v>

1009
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:33.183
<v Speaker 3>When you see the sort of what seems to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be the rising white identity and </v>

1010
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.690
<v Speaker 3>movement or European identitarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement or,</v>

1011
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.680
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

1012
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.543
<v Speaker 3>what do you make of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you view it purely as the natural </v>

1013
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:45.754
<v Speaker 3>reaction to this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything legitimate out of </v>

1014
00:47:47.351 --> 00:47:48.184
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are there parts that are not racist or </v>

1015
00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:51.500
<v Speaker 3>is it truly based in racist?</v>

1016
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:52.461
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>

1017
00:47:52.461 --> 00:47:54.620
<v Speaker 2>very worried about this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say very,</v>

1018
00:47:54.621 --> 00:47:56.700
<v Speaker 2>very worried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1019
00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.233
<v Speaker 2>if you have people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud of the color of my skin </v>

1020
00:48:02.781 --> 00:48:06.230
<v Speaker 2>because it's just skin color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course there'll be some people who'll</v>

1021
00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.730
<v Speaker 2>do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

1022
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said to me the other day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's,</v>

1023
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.570
<v Speaker 2>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you proud of being white?</v>

1024
00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:12.561
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1025
00:48:12.561 --> 00:48:16.970
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would I be proud of pigmentation?</v>

1026
00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.190
<v Speaker 2>But I then turned around and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1027
00:48:20.191 --> 00:48:21.024
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you asked me if I am proud of my </v>

1028
00:48:22.011 --> 00:48:23.630
<v Speaker 2>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say of course,</v>

1029
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that I,</v>

1030
00:48:26.341 --> 00:48:27.174
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1031
00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not really about pride and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>couch,</v>

1032
00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1033
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.173
<v Speaker 2>some years ago I wrote a piece about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this for book the Prime Minister Gordon </v>

1034
00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Brown was editing on Britishness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1035
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think of these things in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of patriotism.</v>

1036
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I think it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of gratitude.</v>

1037
00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:47.680
<v Speaker 2>I feel gratitude before I've been lucky </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to be born into A.</v>

1038
00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:53.540
<v Speaker 2>I'd love it if other people who wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be part of it became a part of it.</v>

1039
00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:54.374
<v Speaker 2>And I think they can and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be and can't be racially </v>

1040
00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:01.490
<v Speaker 2>exclusionary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's madness,</v>

1041
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:03.223
<v Speaker 2>but it's a madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that some people will be </v>

1042
00:49:05.151 --> 00:49:09.210
<v Speaker 2>falling into by being pushed and by </v>
<v Speaker 2>being ignorant and,</v>

1043
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:11.280
<v Speaker 2>and other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1044
00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I come back to this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be some people who will,</v>

1045
00:49:13.581 --> 00:49:14.414
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've found this a lot in conversations </v>

1046
00:49:15.741 --> 00:49:17.720
<v Speaker 2>across the continent in the last year or</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1047
00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:21.560
<v Speaker 2>there will be people who will grab a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the identity thing for themselves,</v>

1048
00:49:21.561 --> 00:49:26.390
<v Speaker 2>for tactical reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will get to this goal and we'll use a</v>

1049
00:49:26.391 --> 00:49:28.970
<v Speaker 2>dishonest tactic just like you're using </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1050
00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:29.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there'll be other people who will </v>

1051
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:32.750
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1052
00:49:32.751 --> 00:49:35.930
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a tactic is what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what I feel is what I believe.</v>

1053
00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:37.653
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just strongly urge people not to go </v>

1054
00:49:40.221 --> 00:49:41.054
<v Speaker 2>down that route,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly urge them not to go down the </v>

1055
00:49:44.511 --> 00:49:49.511
<v Speaker 2>route of identifying by an accident or </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin pigmentation.</v>

1056
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:51.223
<v Speaker 2>But to say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to talk in terms of values </v>

1057
00:49:56.001 --> 00:49:58.340
<v Speaker 2>and in terms of civilization and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

1058
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:00.950
<v Speaker 2>you cannot make it exclusionary like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1059
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.780
<v Speaker 2>But the point about this is it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1060
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:07.610
<v Speaker 2>that can only be that it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it were,</v>

1061
00:50:07.611 --> 00:50:08.444
<v Speaker 2>white young guy who's told that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>also got to tell it to the angry young </v>

1062
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:18.040
<v Speaker 2>black demagogue who's telling people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have their own skin color to isolate and</v>

1063
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:23.910
<v Speaker 2>congregate around around race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got,</v>

1064
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:26.150
<v Speaker 2>it's got everyone's got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1065
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.940
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make the deal as it were on this,</v>

1066
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:32.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just am filled with,</v>

1067
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1068
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:36.320
<v Speaker 2>concerned about this</v>

1069
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:38.603
<v Speaker 3>and that probably has a little something</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do with the word strange because it </v>

1070
00:50:42.151 --> 00:50:42.984
<v Speaker 3>seems to me that it's possible that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ship has already sailed on this perhaps </v>

1071
00:50:47.491 --> 00:50:48.324
<v Speaker 3>more in Europe than in America because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys had an integration problem </v>

1072
00:50:52.831 --> 00:50:55.590
<v Speaker 3>already from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is finally being acknowledged now.</v>

1073
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.320
<v Speaker 3>But then you also have this new set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1074
00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.213
<v Speaker 3>So even if everything was fantastic with</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people that were there and all </v>

1075
00:51:03.121 --> 00:51:03.954
<v Speaker 3>the integration before 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you even do with just the new </v>

1076
00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:08.064
<v Speaker 3>set of problem?</v>

1077
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1078
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:10.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1079
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:10.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Scotland there's a exists small </v>

1080
00:51:12.861 --> 00:51:13.694
<v Speaker 2>amount now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a Catholic Protestant mainly </v>

1081
00:51:16.011 --> 00:51:19.100
<v Speaker 2>centered around football supporting </v>
<v Speaker 2>Celtic Rangers.</v>

1082
00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1083
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:24.980
<v Speaker 2>they go by a religious affiliation still</v>
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>

1084
00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:26.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's because of a movement of </v>

1085
00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Catholics from Ireland and Scotland a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time ago.</v>

1086
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you another example.</v>

1087
00:51:35.241 --> 00:51:38.480
<v Speaker 2>I had a very dear friend who died </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently who was a brilliant,</v>

1088
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:39.590
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very brave man,</v>

1089
00:51:39.591 --> 00:51:43.310
<v Speaker 2>uncle Shawn Callahan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a double agent within the IRA,</v>

1090
00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 2>the troubles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

1091
00:51:44.391 --> 00:51:45.224
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got up to the top of the IRA command </v>

1092
00:51:46.281 --> 00:51:49.370
<v Speaker 2>and he was informing all the time to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Irish state and saved many,</v>

1093
00:51:49.371 --> 00:51:50.660
<v Speaker 2>many lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was an extraordinary,</v>

1094
00:51:50.661 --> 00:51:52.390
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1095
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.233
<v Speaker 2>I wrote an obituary for him and others </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his friends did one of the most </v>

1096
00:51:57.021 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1097
00:51:59.061 --> 00:51:59.894
<v Speaker 2>one of the only negative pieces of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>short was in the Boston Globe who </v>

1098
00:52:03.801 --> 00:52:05.210
<v Speaker 2>referred to him as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

1099
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:09.080
<v Speaker 2>as a grass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as somebody who,</v>

1100
00:52:09.081 --> 00:52:10.500
<v Speaker 2>after you've come out and written his </v>
<v Speaker 2>memoir,</v>

1101
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.170
<v Speaker 2>came to Hawk them around America.</v>

1102
00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Not just selling a book on writing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>hawking a book.</v>

1103
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Why would that appear in the Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>Globe only because a very long time ago,</v>

1104
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:23.623
<v Speaker 2>a large number of people from Ireland </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrived in this country and settled in </v>

1105
00:52:27.081 --> 00:52:27.914
<v Speaker 2>Boston and held onto their Irish </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity and some of them have held on </v>

1106
00:52:33.201 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 2>to a belief that the IRA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a murderess,</v>

1107
00:52:36.441 --> 00:52:41.090
<v Speaker 2>murderess sectarian gang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas where their people.</v>

1108
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:45.470
<v Speaker 2>So all these centuries later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1109
00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:48.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attitude and the Boston Globe,</v>

1110
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.410
<v Speaker 2>when a man who risked his life to save </v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

1111
00:52:51.411 --> 00:52:56.240
<v Speaker 2>many other people's lives dies and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>to attack him basically as a grass and a</v>

1112
00:52:56.241 --> 00:52:57.170
<v Speaker 2>snitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1113
00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:02.380
<v Speaker 2>That's the movement of Catholic Irish </v>
<v Speaker 2>people into America who on earth,</v>

1114
00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:08.531
<v Speaker 2>things that when you bring the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing world into Europe,</v>

1115
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:13.460
<v Speaker 2>including very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very large numbers of young men from the</v>

1116
00:53:13.461 --> 00:53:14.294
<v Speaker 2>Muslim world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is going to be sorted out by </v>

1117
00:53:16.071 --> 00:53:18.300
<v Speaker 2>next February.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:19.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

1119
00:53:19.871 --> 00:53:22.870
<v Speaker 3>roughly this time next year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So does this show,</v>

1120
00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use the phrase lazy thinking a lot,</v>

1121
00:53:25.801 --> 00:53:29.190
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that's not the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shows an inability to think,</v>

1122
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:31.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you said about Merkel in 2010.</v>

1123
00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:31.771
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1124
00:53:31.771 --> 00:53:33.690
<v Speaker 3>we thought they were going to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not lazy thinking.</v>

1125
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:35.790
<v Speaker 3>That's man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you even think.</v>

1126
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.571
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1127
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty good in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1128
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:39.054
<v Speaker 3>if you let people in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there ever been a self imposed group </v>

1129
00:53:43.141 --> 00:53:46.880
<v Speaker 3>of people that left a western country to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to Iraq?</v>

1130
00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very uncommon know</v>

1131
00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:50.840
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once people,</v>

1132
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:56.950
<v Speaker 1>once people realize that the economics </v>
<v Speaker 1>works better in Europe,</v>

1133
00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.680
<v Speaker 1>doesn't in sub Saharan Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1134
00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.390
<v Speaker 1>of course they come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we.</v>

1135
00:54:02.391 --> 00:54:03.224
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just so torn about this and I </v>

1136
00:54:05.331 --> 00:54:08.870
<v Speaker 1>think we have to rouse ourselves to more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than moroseness.</v>

1137
00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.153
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me because we were not sure </v>

1138
00:54:12.411 --> 00:54:14.420
<v Speaker 1>why on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure why,</v>

1139
00:54:14.421 --> 00:54:18.500
<v Speaker 1>but as counselors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not entirely sure why it should be</v>

1140
00:54:18.501 --> 00:54:20.720
<v Speaker 1>our right to keep anyone out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here.</v>

1141
00:54:20.721 --> 00:54:22.760
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously an American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America has a different issue.</v>

1142
00:54:22.761 --> 00:54:23.594
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's an American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's legitimate to say America is a </v>

1143
00:54:26.241 --> 00:54:27.074
<v Speaker 1>nation of immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not legitimate to say that about </v>

1144
00:54:29.271 --> 00:54:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just isn't.</v>

1145
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Hasn't been delivered late 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Nation of immigrants and they're very,</v>

1146
00:54:34.071 --> 00:54:37.430
<v Speaker 1>very static population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the Norman Conquest,</v>

1147
00:54:37.431 --> 00:54:38.264
<v Speaker 1>the thousand years ago shifted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population by about five percent in the </v>

1148
00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:41.990
<v Speaker 1>UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1149
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that in America,</v>

1150
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.380
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing to do with immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a bit harder.</v>

1151
00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.590
<v Speaker 1>People feel they're talking not about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1152
00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:56.080
<v Speaker 1>but about you or me and in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1153
00:54:56.081 --> 00:54:58.670
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a bit of the case.</v>

1154
00:54:58.671 --> 00:54:59.504
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people who talk in those </v>

1155
00:54:59.961 --> 00:55:01.010
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also.</v>

1156
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.620
<v Speaker 1>There's also just this additional thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1157
00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.430
<v Speaker 1>by what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1158
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:06.890
<v Speaker 1>By what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1159
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Would I be allowed to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone can come.</v>

1160
00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:12.003
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are all sorts of ways you </v>

1161
00:55:13.011 --> 00:55:14.940
<v Speaker 1>argue the law</v>

1162
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:19.920
<v Speaker 3>matter shouldn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference between legal and illegal</v>

1163
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.580
<v Speaker 3>is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1164
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:23.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

1165
00:55:23.341 --> 00:55:24.174
<v Speaker 3>Because we have a border.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means that a Canadian has to obey </v>

1166
00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:29.670
<v Speaker 3>the laws of Canada and I have to obey </v>
<v Speaker 3>the laws of the United States.</v>

1167
00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.580
<v Speaker 3>People think that even in of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's somehow controversial.</v>

1168
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:33.780
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1169
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:34.973
<v Speaker 1>what a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just been watching Justin Trudeau </v>

1170
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:42.860
<v Speaker 1>have to face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy for politicians in Europe.</v>

1171
00:55:42.961 --> 00:55:44.600
<v Speaker 1>We've seen a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen it here in America.</v>

1172
00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:45.453
<v Speaker 1>Canadians have seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to grandstand or this let </v>

1173
00:55:49.951 --> 00:55:53.890
<v Speaker 1>them in a open the doors because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects happen,</v>

1174
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.753
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you'll be out of power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be retired somewhere in a nice </v>

1175
00:55:57.001 --> 00:55:59.550
<v Speaker 1>area with lots of people like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was your dirty little secret.</v>

1176
00:55:59.551 --> 00:56:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1177
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:01.043
<v Speaker 3>He'll move to New Zealand or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that where they all moving in New </v>

1178
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:03.683
<v Speaker 3>Zealand?</v>

1179
00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1180
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:11.520
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau is on the qb sort of berated and</v>

1181
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:14.130
<v Speaker 1>morally grandstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course when there's movement</v>

1182
00:56:14.131 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 1>of people from America across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian border,</v>

1183
00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start to get worried.</v>

1184
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 1>A Bill Gates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1185
00:56:21.781 --> 00:56:23.500
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the migrant crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1186
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:24.363
<v Speaker 1>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that America should take in the same </v>

1187
00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:26.794
<v Speaker 1>proportion of migrants that year as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany to Germany took in an extra two </v>

1188
00:56:29.231 --> 00:56:31.330
<v Speaker 1>percent of its population in one year </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

1189
00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1190
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:35.220
<v Speaker 1>and Bill Gates said we should take in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same numbers in,</v>

1191
00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.390
<v Speaker 1>in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has Germany did in,</v>

1192
00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.940
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1193
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:40.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting enough.</v>

1194
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Only a couple of months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates,</v>

1195
00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.660
<v Speaker 1>I did a reverse ferret on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1196
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:46.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he certainly in a set of remarks</v>

1197
00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:49.780
<v Speaker 1>that if Germany continues like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to destroy it.</v>

1198
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if Bill Gates,</v>

1199
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:55.150
<v Speaker 1>instead of being the world's richest man</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been in charge of anything,</v>

1200
00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:56.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1201
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:57.763
<v Speaker 1>then you'd have gone through what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany is going through and it would </v>

1202
00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:05.320
<v Speaker 1>have vastly outlasted him as this will </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlast Merkel and all of us.</v>

1203
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:09.280
<v Speaker 1>So the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me the two things that I can</v>

1204
00:57:09.281 --> 00:57:10.114
<v Speaker 1>point out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is demanding with our political </v>

1205
00:57:12.791 --> 00:57:17.470
<v Speaker 1>leaders in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think through things beyond the two year</v>

1206
00:57:17.471 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 1>electoral cycle or the four year </v>
<v Speaker 1>electoral cycle,</v>

1207
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:22.840
<v Speaker 1>or more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just more of a morning's headlines.</v>

1208
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:24.123
<v Speaker 1>You might have a bad mornings news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot better than fucking up your </v>

1209
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot better.</v>

1210
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:29.973
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing about this is we </v>

1211
00:57:33.011 --> 00:57:38.011
<v Speaker 1>have to develop the ability to have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult discussion about these things that</v>

1212
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:41.500
<v Speaker 1>recognizes it's not between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1213
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.180
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the migrants.</v>

1214
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm against them or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1215
00:57:46.121 --> 00:57:47.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Churchill,</v>

1216
00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your chamberlain,</v>

1217
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:50.674
<v Speaker 1>your Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to have the discussion on </v>

1218
00:57:53.471 --> 00:57:58.471
<v Speaker 1>recognizing these are different opinions</v>
<v Speaker 1>about our future and the and the,</v>

1219
00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:02.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say toward the end of the book that we</v>

1220
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:04.060
<v Speaker 1>have the tools for doing this.</v>

1221
00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:04.893
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle showed us a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just a competition between </v>

1222
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:09.371
<v Speaker 1>virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angola,</v>

1223
00:58:09.371 --> 00:58:10.204
<v Speaker 1>Merkel very understandably felt the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human virtue of mercy to be merciful </v>

1224
00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:17.890
<v Speaker 1>towards people who are trying to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I say yes,</v>

1225
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.753
<v Speaker 1>but there is another virtue competing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that which is the virtue of </v>

1226
00:58:20.711 --> 00:58:21.544
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just justice for the people of the </v>

1227
00:58:23.981 --> 00:58:25.660
<v Speaker 1>world wanting to come and have a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1228
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.823
<v Speaker 1>but justice for the peoples of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have the discussion on those </v>

1229
00:58:30.761 --> 00:58:35.230
<v Speaker 1>terms between competing virtues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing good and evil right and wrong.</v>

1230
00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Churchill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>

1231
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:37.811
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1232
00:58:37.811 --> 00:58:38.644
<v Speaker 1>You not see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might be able to get somewhere </v>

1233
00:58:41.711 --> 00:58:42.544
<v Speaker 1>and Mr Gresham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's as if we've sort of wounded </v>

1234
00:58:44.951 --> 00:58:48.220
<v Speaker 1>ourselves before even starting at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>start line.</v>

1235
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.700
<v Speaker 1>So as to people that try to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1236
00:58:51.701 --> 00:58:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what we consistently try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1237
00:58:54.491 --> 00:58:57.130
<v Speaker 1>And I see you debating all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from every walk of life.</v>

1238
00:58:57.131 --> 00:58:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a promiscuous debating debate.</v>

1239
00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:02.060
<v Speaker 1>It basically everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

1240
00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.330
<v Speaker 1>some people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1241
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.193
<v Speaker 1>now in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because I had debated and so much </v>

1242
00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.710
<v Speaker 1>they were prosecuting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1243
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've debated lots of people who I'm sure</v>

1244
00:59:11.171 --> 00:59:12.004
<v Speaker 1>you've sent a couple of people to mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions for after they've had to </v>

1245
00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:17.530
<v Speaker 1>deal with your wit that it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1246
00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:18.460
<v Speaker 1>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1247
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:20.170
<v Speaker 1>if somebody is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1248
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the general public</v>

1249
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 2>and has a platform and they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

1250
00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I've always had the view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1251
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 2>That's not sale debate anyone by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1252
00:59:28.761 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1253
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:31.520
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't debate me.</v>

1254
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:36.240
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got to twitter followers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're nuts.</v>

1255
00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Blue Fox on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1256
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Xena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>warrior princess.</v>

1257
00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that woman,</v>

1258
00:59:45.121 --> 00:59:48.880
<v Speaker 3>she really wants to debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm alright.</v>

1259
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:49.733
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we got a nice holistic piece of </v>

1260
00:59:51.391 --> 00:59:52.460
<v Speaker 3>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1261
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.690
<v Speaker 3>so I wanted to shift altogether to end </v>
<v Speaker 3>this on a,</v>

1262
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:57.600
<v Speaker 3>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something somewhat on lifting,</v>

1263
00:59:57.850 --> 01:00:01.680
<v Speaker 3>uplifting as someone that does all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you speak about this stuff.</v>

1264
01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.330
<v Speaker 3>You deeply care about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1265
01:00:03.331 --> 01:00:04.164
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worry about this stuff constantly be </v>

1266
01:00:05.191 --> 01:00:06.024
<v Speaker 3>wowed me staring off into nothing in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of the day and I'm literally </v>

1267
01:00:08.641 --> 01:00:10.980
<v Speaker 3>worried about the fate of the Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1268
01:00:10.981 --> 01:00:11.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1269
01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.730
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was playing video games again </v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as I used to,</v>

1270
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.480
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost you on the video game thing.</v>

1271
01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>

1272
01:00:19.511 --> 01:00:20.344
<v Speaker 3>what do you do for fun?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do to just forget all this </v>

1273
01:00:21.811 --> 01:00:24.030
<v Speaker 3>stuff and just enjoy yourself and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>human?</v>

1274
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1275
01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:27.483
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you don't like this type of </v>

1276
01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:28.940
<v Speaker 3>question because this is.</v>

1277
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1278
01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm careful about private matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1279
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.533
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happily in a relationship with </v>

1280
01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:41.300
<v Speaker 2>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of my family.</v>

1281
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I've got wonderful friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see them a lot.</v>

1282
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I to relax.</v>

1283
01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:47.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read,</v>

1284
01:00:47.961 --> 01:00:49.910
<v Speaker 2>I read all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1285
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.830
<v Speaker 2>and not just good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enjoyable,</v>

1286
01:00:51.831 --> 01:00:56.831
<v Speaker 2>but because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just endlessly learning and thinking</v>

1287
01:00:58.271 --> 01:00:59.104
<v Speaker 2>and so it's just so stimulating </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when you have that thing of </v>

1288
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:04.750
<v Speaker 2>what I described as catching up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

1289
01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.210
<v Speaker 2>you'd always known was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1290
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.673
<v Speaker 2>the thrill of recognition that you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>from reading that I think is harder to </v>

1291
01:01:12.111 --> 01:01:16.700
<v Speaker 2>find in video games or television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1292
01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:17.320
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1293
01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.470
<v Speaker 2>so I do a lot of reading</v>

1294
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.593
<v Speaker 3>as I'll shift this a little then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what would you say more importantly </v>

1295
01:01:22.331 --> 01:01:23.290
<v Speaker 3>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

1296
01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:24.183
<v Speaker 3>to the person that's watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the type of email that I get all the </v>

1297
01:01:26.441 --> 01:01:27.274
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person that is just a regular </v>

1298
01:01:28.811 --> 01:01:30.430
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1299
01:01:30.431 --> 01:01:33.460
<v Speaker 3>working a regular job that sees these </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>

1300
01:01:33.461 --> 01:01:36.430
<v Speaker 3>that hears you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not a bigot and is not a racist,</v>

1301
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:40.360
<v Speaker 3>but he's genuinely afraid of doing what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do every which is say what you think</v>

1302
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:44.560
<v Speaker 3>that they're genuinely afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just putting their thoughts out there,</v>

1303
01:01:44.561 --> 01:01:45.394
<v Speaker 3>be it on social media or be it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's getting to the point where they're </v>

1304
01:01:47.411 --> 01:01:49.830
<v Speaker 3>afraid to talk to their own spouses </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what,</v>

1305
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.823
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what could you say to somebody to give </v>

1306
01:01:51.611 --> 01:01:53.040
<v Speaker 3>them a little bit of a boost on that?</v>

1307
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1308
01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:57.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water's not as cold as people say.</v>

1309
01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.080
<v Speaker 2>It really isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1310
01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1311
01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1312
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:06.500
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one isn't it?</v>

1313
01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:07.334
<v Speaker 2>Because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has been a lot of focus on the </v>

1314
01:02:09.921 --> 01:02:10.754
<v Speaker 2>negatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly some of the things we're </v>

1315
01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:12.403
<v Speaker 2>talking about today in recent years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a sort of growing feeling of </v>

1316
01:02:14.911 --> 01:02:15.744
<v Speaker 2>actually wanting to previous recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>inferior as a google guy is a </v>

1317
01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 2>demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more that stuff</v>

1318
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more that people keep down.</v>

1319
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1320
01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1321
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>you can't be brave for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell other people,</v>

1322
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak up.</v>

1323
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1324
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I think we can encourage each other to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1325
01:02:38.101 --> 01:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1326
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:45.020
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people approach me in a sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of just want to not use.</v>

1327
01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Must be pretty hard for you to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1328
01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:50.161
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

1329
01:02:50.161 --> 01:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have cocktails.</v>

1330
01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>My friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1331
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I go to concerts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read things I want,</v>

1332
01:02:56.221 --> 01:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love and,</v>

1333
01:02:58.590 --> 01:02:59.423
<v Speaker 1>and I travel where I live and I go all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the world and we're not going to </v>

1334
01:03:03.401 --> 01:03:07.380
<v Speaker 1>get any extra security tonight already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope we're going to beverly hills.</v>

1335
01:03:07.381 --> 01:03:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll probably be friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pick a fight with anyone today,</v>

1336
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:12.840
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am A.</v>

1337
01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's either you sit up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sort of exaggerate.</v>

1338
01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm asking you this question </v>

1339
01:03:18.691 --> 01:03:20.520
<v Speaker 1>because I do think it's partly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's mind.</v>

1340
01:03:20.521 --> 01:03:22.290
<v Speaker 1>You start speaking then you realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1341
01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean somebody said some bad stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>about me,</v>

1342
01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:25.020
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1343
01:03:25.021 --> 01:03:25.801
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>

1344
01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:28.190
<v Speaker 1>some are quite a lot of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young journalists and things saying you,</v>

1345
01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I'd really like to write this but you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1346
01:03:29.581 --> 01:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all this sort of thing and you know,</v>

1347
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.380
<v Speaker 1>get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let just,</v>

1348
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:37.500
<v Speaker 1>just see and just write it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1349
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean no one ever awarded somebody for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a career in journalism the way they said</v>

1350
01:03:41.641 --> 01:03:44.400
<v Speaker 1>nothing over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some writers in New York Times</v>

1351
01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:45.234
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

1352
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.160
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1353
01:03:47.161 --> 01:03:49.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just just,</v>

1354
01:03:49.941 --> 01:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it does,</v>

1355
01:03:51.401 --> 01:03:52.234
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very lucky in that I've spent my </v>

1356
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.233
<v Speaker 1>career saying what I think and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to earn a living precariously but </v>

1357
01:03:59.131 --> 01:03:59.964
<v Speaker 1>successfully and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I can write for almost any </v>

1358
01:04:04.651 --> 01:04:08.700
<v Speaker 1>of the newspapers I want to write for </v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost all of them will have me.</v>

1359
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.890
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love writing for the range of them and</v>

1360
01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm very lucky to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like I'm,</v>

1361
01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.950
<v Speaker 1>it's not like that's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1362
01:04:16.951 --> 01:04:17.784
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still legal to say what you think </v>

1363
01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I,</v>

1364
01:04:23.431 --> 01:04:24.264
<v Speaker 1>I just hate it when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really admire you for saying what </v>

1365
01:04:26.101 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you do?</v>

1366
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1367
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.550
<v Speaker 1>but he said it's only that we all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all get used to the idea and just,</v>

1368
01:04:34.551 --> 01:04:35.311
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one other thing,</v>

1369
01:04:35.311 --> 01:04:39.270
<v Speaker 1>which is just about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I find myself more and more tolerant</v>

1370
01:04:39.271 --> 01:04:42.090
<v Speaker 1>of people's opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just more and more tolerant of it.</v>

1371
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>

1372
01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I see people driving themselves mad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sort of thing.</v>

1373
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are some things like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

1374
01:04:49.111 --> 01:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I discovered they were into,</v>

1375
01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kitty fiddling or something and I'd have</v>

1376
01:04:53.221 --> 01:04:54.930
<v Speaker 1>something to say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pretty much,</v>

1377
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on politics and all sorts of other </v>

1378
01:04:57.871 --> 01:04:58.980
<v Speaker 1>things I find myself like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1379
01:04:58.981 --> 01:04:59.640
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1380
01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1381
01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.713
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating and who would want to </v>

1382
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:11.370
<v Speaker 1>keep all of that down and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1383
01:05:11.371 --> 01:05:14.220
<v Speaker 1>as long as we agree on the parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as we agree that,</v>

1384
01:05:14.221 --> 01:05:16.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't shoot on the beach hut,</v>

1385
01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously up for negotiation,</v>
