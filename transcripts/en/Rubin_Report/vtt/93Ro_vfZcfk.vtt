1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.033
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.023
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before I get to what's going on in the </v>

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:07.644
<v Speaker 2>world this week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to once again thank all of you </v>

4
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 2>who support what we do here on the Rubin</v>
<v Speaker 2>report.</v>

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm thrilled to finally be able to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>you our brand new home studio today.</v>

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 2>It took a tremendous amount of blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweat,</v>

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 2>tears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

8
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 2>even money to build it and we simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>could not have done it without you.</v>

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.683
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main thanks goes out to all of you </v>

10
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 2>who donate monthly to the show on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrion.</v>

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.363
<v Speaker 2>As you guys give us the budget to create</v>
<v Speaker 2>content as we see fit with no </v>

12
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 2>executives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bosses,</v>

13
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 2>or middlemen between me and you beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>our patrons.</v>

14
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:38.064
<v Speaker 2>I also want to thank all of those who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have given one time donations on paypal </v>

15
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 2>as well as to all of you who watch light</v>
<v Speaker 2>comment on and share our videos with our</v>

16
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 2>new home studio.</v>

17
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 2>We can fully expand on everything we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been building here,</v>

18
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 2>including more shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer interviews,</v>

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.633
<v Speaker 2>and new segments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I truly believe that the ideas of </v>

20
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 2>classical liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logic,</v>

21
00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:58.734
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and individual liberty are the only </v>

22
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 2>solution to the authoritarian and </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremist problems we're seeing all over</v>

23
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 2>the world right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll continue to have conversations with</v>

24
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>people I both agree with and disagree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with and just as importantly,</v>

25
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:12.744
<v Speaker 2>I'll continue to listen to you from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriot on one on one chats to group </v>

26
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Google hangouts to emails and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even twitter,</v>

27
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 2>you guys consistently amaze me at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>insight and desire for truth.</v>

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.833
<v Speaker 2>My commute is now just 10 steps down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hall from my bedroom and I promised to </v>

29
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 2>use that new found time to make this </v>
<v Speaker 2>show even better than before.</v>

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.833
<v Speaker 2>You've truly helped my dreams become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality and somehow we're right back at </v>

31
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:37.434
<v Speaker 2>the beginning.</v>

32
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 2>In the course of the month that we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>building this studio,</v>

33
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 2>basically a million things happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if you've heard about this,</v>

34
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 2>but we had an election in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States and Donald Trump.</v>

35
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump is now the president elect.</v>

36
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 2>While most of the media seemed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely blindsided by the results,</v>

37
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:54.624
<v Speaker 2>I can honestly say that I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to and listen to people like </v>

38
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Scott Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>

39
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:03.060
<v Speaker 2>and Mike Cernovich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whether I agreed with them or not,</v>

40
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I realized that there was a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>political movement behind their words.</v>

41
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.033
<v Speaker 2>When you couple this reality with </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate liberals and moderate </v>

42
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 2>conservatives who are sick of identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and outrage culture,</v>

43
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 2>trump winning actually seems kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious in hindsight.</v>

44
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do my best not to judge </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's actions until he's actually an </v>

45
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:24.894
<v Speaker 2>office because until then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything people are saying are just </v>

46
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 2>guesses and conjecture.</v>

47
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 2>As I said in my direct message right </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the election,</v>

48
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll be the first to hold trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak to the fire once he's in office,</v>

49
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.083
<v Speaker 2>but the simple fact is that he's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president elect now and we've got to </v>

50
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 2>give him a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the rub of democracy.</v>

51
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:43.734
<v Speaker 2>Your team doesn't always win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't burn down the system just </v>

52
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 2>because you were on the losing end this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

53
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether you hate or love </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

54
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt that something good did</v>
<v Speaker 2>come out of this election.</v>

55
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 2>People seem to be engaged in a whole new</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

56
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.603
<v Speaker 2>People are talking politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting for what they believe in </v>

57
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.274
<v Speaker 2>getting involved in the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even more now than when Obama ran </v>

58
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:07.564
<v Speaker 2>for the first time back in 2008 I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get a whole new crop of </v>

59
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:11.914
<v Speaker 2>political leaders out of this chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope some new political movements as </v>

60
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.204
<v Speaker 2>well as I've been saying for a year now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're an old school liberal than an </v>

61
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 2>old school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative is no longer your enemy.</v>

62
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I really think a new center can arise </v>
<v Speaker 2>from this and if trump is smart,</v>

63
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.083
<v Speaker 2>he can actually make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is a populist and that means he </v>

64
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.134
<v Speaker 2>wants to be popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of us are socially liberal and </v>

65
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:35.464
<v Speaker 2>fiscally conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of us are not the alt right or the </v>

66
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 2>regressive left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of us don't care what you do in the</v>

67
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.304
<v Speaker 2>privacy of your own home and we want </v>
<v Speaker 2>government to take less instead of </v>

68
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.624
<v Speaker 2>giving more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can actually push trump </v>

69
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 2>towards these ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if not,</v>

70
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 2>then maybe we'll just have to create our</v>
<v Speaker 2>own movement to do so.</v>

71
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's already begun with all this</v>

72
00:03:58.421 --> 00:03:59.254
<v Speaker 2>in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got the perfect guest for you this </v>

73
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Radio host and columnist Ben Shapiro.</v>

74
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Ben Is what I would consider an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>school conservative,</v>

75
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 2>which like me as a classical liberal is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a strange place to be these days.</v>

76
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.753
<v Speaker 2>Does he fit in with the new trump led </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican party any more than I fit in </v>

77
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 2>with the identity politics driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democratic Party?</v>

78
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Not so sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're both on the outside looking in and</v>

79
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly where I think we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>start building bridges.</v>

80
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.123
<v Speaker 2>I was on the daily wire livestream with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben on election night and I got to see </v>

81
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was alternately thrilled that Hillary</v>

82
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:37.441
<v Speaker 2>lost but also totally dismayed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump had won a couple of hours in a few</v>

83
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:38.314
<v Speaker 2>beers later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We both managed to survive the evening </v>

84
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 2>even if we didn't see eye to eye on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>

85
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 2>There is huge opportunity for all of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>to shape the future of the country right</v>

86
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:49.024
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no way it can change if we </v>

87
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 2>just complain about the system instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting involved.</v>

88
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 2>The rhetoric on Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake news,</v>

89
00:04:56.741 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 2>stories about fake news and outrage </v>
<v Speaker 2>after outrage are not only going to keep</v>

90
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 2>coming but they're going to get stronger</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stronger.</v>

91
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.193
<v Speaker 2>The only way we'll stop them and cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the noise is to figure out what </v>

92
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:09.364
<v Speaker 2>we believe and to fight for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a new studio and a new </v>

93
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 2>commitment to continue that fight and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hope that you'll join me.</v>

94
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.350
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're back,</v>

95
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joining me this week is a radio host,</v>

96
00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:27.330
<v Speaker 2>columnist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>editor and chief of daily wire.com</v>

97
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:31.500
<v Speaker 2>and most importantly now to Time Ruben </v>
<v Speaker 2>Report Guest Ben Shapiro.</v>

98
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Welcome back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is here.</v>

99
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.133
<v Speaker 2>I thought you would be the right guy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have for the first show in our new </v>

100
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:38.940
<v Speaker 2>studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're thinking,</v>

101
00:05:38.941 --> 00:05:40.920
<v Speaker 2>but sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

102
00:05:40.921 --> 00:05:43.860
<v Speaker 2>because a lot has happened since we last</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoke.</v>

103
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:44.694
<v Speaker 2>Probably A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say roughly about a year ago and I </v>

104
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:48.354
<v Speaker 2>was with you on election night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had me over at the daily wire </v>

105
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.520
<v Speaker 2>studios and we had a great time and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had some beers.</v>

106
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:55.380
<v Speaker 2>You were reading a lot of m and M's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

107
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 2>and that sugar intake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

108
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 3>the thing that I found most interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>was that you did not like Hillary,</v>

109
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.371
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair to say.</v>

110
00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Did say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think she's awful.</v>

111
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Not Like Hillary Clinton clearly do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Donald Trump.</v>

112
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.561
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

113
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:10.570
<v Speaker 3>so far I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

114
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right on the money.</v>

115
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 3>That's so watching you throughout that </v>
<v Speaker 3>evening,</v>

116
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 3>the rollercoaster of emotions that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were going through,</v>

117
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:18.824
<v Speaker 3>going from when I sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's still a good for hillary to </v>

118
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 3>then it's starting to look like trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>then realizing it was inevitable,</v>

119
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:27.050
<v Speaker 3>but before they called it and everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

120
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean you went through every emotion </v>
<v Speaker 3>alone.</v>

121
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Bizarro world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

122
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:33.720
<v Speaker 3>it was definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely weird because you know,</v>

123
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

124
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:36.374
<v Speaker 3>I was sort of rooting for both of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get left adrift in a rowboat </v>

125
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.133
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But unfortunately one of them was going </v>

126
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 3>to be presidents of the United States.</v>

127
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 3>So there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a bit,</v>

128
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of up and down and going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

129
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:45.134
<v Speaker 3>meaning that I was overjoyed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary was not president of the United </v>

130
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.973
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that kept hillary out of the </v>

131
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 3>White House.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very happy about.</v>

132
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 3>And then I looked at who was actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>entering the White House and I went,</v>

133
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 3>oh this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have some,</v>

134
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 3>some trepidation about not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not sold on the,</v>

135
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 3>on this whole trump thing cause I hadn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>

136
00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 3>I didn't end up voting for either of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

137
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 3>I left the blue at the top of the ticket</v>
<v Speaker 3>blank.</v>

138
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:02.684
<v Speaker 3>Neither of them fulfilled my basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirements to be president of the </v>

139
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you know,</v>

140
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 3>I was wrong about where I thought trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be.</v>

141
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.224
<v Speaker 3>I thought trump was going to lose just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like everybody else who is looking at </v>

142
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 3>the polls from nate silver to Larry </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sabato and uh,</v>

143
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 3>and I was clearly a 100% wrong on that.</v>

144
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.023
<v Speaker 3>So now I just hope that I'm wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 3>him as a person and a president because </v>

145
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 3>if I'm right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's going to be a long four years.</v>

146
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 3>I have a feeling that no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

147
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a little no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I for sure.</v>

148
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.863
<v Speaker 3>Whether he does good stuff and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>come along for the ride or whether he </v>

149
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 3>does bad stuff and they don't get as </v>
<v Speaker 3>good stuff,</v>

150
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 3>then I can feel good about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

151
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm hoping that he does some good </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

152
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At this point you have to do.</v>

153
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:36.614
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if even if you like any of his </v>

154
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.613
<v Speaker 3>positions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's taken over the moral center that </v>

155
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 3>seems to do root for him as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

156
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.753
<v Speaker 3>So I root for him to do good things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the phrase people use this </v>

157
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 3>with Obama also root for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't read for trump,</v>

158
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't refer Obama.</v>

159
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.393
<v Speaker 3>I didn't root for Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a team sport there and I like </v>

160
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 3>the white sox and the bears and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Celtics.</v>

161
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 3>I root for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see them win.</v>

162
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 3>But in politics it's not just about </v>
<v Speaker 3>winning,</v>

163
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:01.334
<v Speaker 3>it's about what you do to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the policies that you </v>

164
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:06.360
<v Speaker 3>implement that constitute winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you actually gauge winning?</v>

165
00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

166
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 3>when trump makes a bad deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good for him politically.</v>

167
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 3>That sounds something I'm in favor of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

168
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:14.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not rooting for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it helps him politically and</v>

169
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm rooting for him to do good things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm rooting for me.</v>

170
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:17.011
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

171
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:17.844
<v Speaker 3>or even from the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm rooting for him to do the things </v>

172
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 3>that will help the country more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes I'm fine,</v>

173
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 3>but help that'll help the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

174
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.613
<v Speaker 3>but what I fear is that I think people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are rooting for him or rooting against </v>

175
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

176
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.080
<v Speaker 3>And if that's your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent this on my podcast today.</v>

177
00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:30.914
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your moral center is basically good </v>

178
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:35.390
<v Speaker 3>for trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is good for the country or bad for trump</v>

179
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.670
<v Speaker 3>is good for the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a different moral center.</v>

180
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 3>So that seems to be the place that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>at right now.</v>

181
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 3>We're trump said I'm going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a winner.</v>

182
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 3>And that that force of will was almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough in and of itself,</v>

183
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.170
<v Speaker 3>an amazing bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hema winter.</v>

184
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 3>So he's your version of winning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would be,</v>

185
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.641
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

186
00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:54.430
<v Speaker 3>having certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

187
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 3>ethical code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

188
00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 3>whether we agree on all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every little policy is irrelevant.</v>

189
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.280
<v Speaker 3>But can you win on that anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that we've seen how trump won.</v>

190
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.413
<v Speaker 3>Do you honestly think that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative can when you playing the </v>

191
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 3>game that's out there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that,</v>

192
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 3>I think that some of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump did,</v>

193
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 3>and I said this very early on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean very early before he started kind</v>

194
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 3>of making an ass of himself repeatedly.</v>

195
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.193
<v Speaker 3>I said that actually there was a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot that he would be a better nominee </v>

196
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:21.954
<v Speaker 3>in terms of winning than Marco Rubio </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I thought that he spoke a moral </v>

197
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:25.044
<v Speaker 3>language about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the other candidates didn't </v>

198
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 3>mean he can go look back at my speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave it University of Missouri in like</v>

199
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:29.874
<v Speaker 3>October,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2015 and I said the trump might be </v>

200
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.154
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially among blue collar whites in </v>

201
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:35.910
<v Speaker 3>states like Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania and Michigan.</v>

202
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 3>So I got it right then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it wrong and your later right.</v>

203
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.521
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

204
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:39.354
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea there is that trump speaks </v>

205
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 3>in terms of mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

206
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:43.104
<v Speaker 3>there are good guys and bad guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you agree with his mortalities </v>

207
00:09:45.141 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 3>and other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for politics,</v>

208
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.333
<v Speaker 3>for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all politics breaks down into good guys </v>

209
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 3>versus bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>

210
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 3>very often it's just I'm the good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody who opposes me is the bad guy.</v>

211
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 3>But that's a way that people think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>

212
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 3>And I think that if you had the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>proper moral,</v>

213
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>content to that sort of narrative,</v>

214
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 3>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could still win based on that.</v>

215
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.140
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny that everybody sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everybody's a binary thinker.</v>

216
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody broke it down into a,</v>

217
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 3>trump is the only one who can campaign </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressively.</v>

218
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 3>He's the only one who can speak this </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral language.</v>

219
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.303
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't against trump campaigning </v>

220
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 3>aggressively or speaking this moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

221
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 3>I just thought that he was applying it </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorrectly.</v>

222
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watch me into Bain,</v>

223
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly applying moral language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly aggressive,</v>

224
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.060
<v Speaker 3>but I disagreed with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

225
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:29.061
<v Speaker 3>you can do both at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are we at a point then of post truth?</v>

226
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.530
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look at what he says now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

227
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.710
<v Speaker 3>most of the criticism I get right now is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm being too kind to him.</v>

228
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying for weeks now we have </v>

229
00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:37.554
<v Speaker 3>to see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get outraged about appointments </v>

230
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:41.430
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to wait to see,</v>

231
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get a sense of what's going on.</v>

232
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.131
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

233
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm not allowed to see what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's right.</v>

234
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not outraged about the appointments.</v>

235
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what he does and what he says.</v>

236
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:50.544
<v Speaker 3>I can be outraged by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that there's an incentive </v>

237
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:54.210
<v Speaker 3>structure that has to exist or if he </v>
<v Speaker 3>does something bad now,</v>

238
00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:55.044
<v Speaker 3>now I criticized him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The argument was made during the </v>

239
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:57.840
<v Speaker 3>election cycle for people on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

240
00:10:57.841 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 3>if he says something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shh,</v>

241
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.810
<v Speaker 3>be quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary might get elected.</v>

242
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my view was,</v>

243
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 3>that's not my job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My job is to,</v>

244
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 3>is as somebody who actually believes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's truthful.</v>

245
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.900
<v Speaker 3>My job is to say what I think is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether he's saying it or not,</v>

246
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 3>but now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially post election,</v>

247
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Hillary is no longer in the picture.</v>

248
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 3>So the question now is if he does </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's false,</v>

249
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 3>are you going to call that out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're a politically on his side</v>

250
00:11:18.841 --> 00:11:20.160
<v Speaker 3>overall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

251
00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 3>that's the real question for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my job,</v>

252
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I still is the same as it ever was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he does something good,</v>

253
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:25.860
<v Speaker 3>I praise him when he does something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

254
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.230
<v Speaker 3>which really is not what many people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't want that.</v>

255
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Now people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

256
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.451
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

257
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:31.370
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they not want it?</v>

258
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.420
<v Speaker 3>Because I suspect they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what I'm trying to do.</v>

259
00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 3>I know it hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't hurt me,</v>

260
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

261
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I think with most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people are refreshed when they hear</v>

262
00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 3>somebody like you or like me say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

263
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:43.170
<v Speaker 3>here's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

264
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:44.004
<v Speaker 3>and I'm putting my own political </v>
<v Speaker 3>interests aside and the interest of the </v>

265
00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:47.700
<v Speaker 3>person who's at risk here.</v>

266
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then here's,</v>

267
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.400
<v Speaker 3>here's what's true and here's what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

268
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.443
<v Speaker 3>But there's a large contingent that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to resist that in a major way </v>

269
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:54.251
<v Speaker 3>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

270
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 3>it has become such a team sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has become,</v>

271
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you say something bad about trump,</v>

272
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.400
<v Speaker 3>then you're a cock and you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're undermining him.</v>

273
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

274
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

275
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Bill O'reilly said there about George </v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

276
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 3>George will criticize the carrier deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Riley comes out and he says,</v>

277
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 3>George,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will's just undermining.</v>

278
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 3>Trump said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a second.</v>

279
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:10.340
<v Speaker 3>He's not my dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's my server.</v>

280
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the opposite.</v>

281
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not his servant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's my servant.</v>

282
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:14.224
<v Speaker 3>He's a public servant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I know that he's been in private </v>

283
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 3>business his whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was running for the job of public</v>

284
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:18.574
<v Speaker 3>servant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's his job to serve the interest </v>

285
00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:20.494
<v Speaker 3>of the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not my job to serve as his </v>

286
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 3>political interests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

287
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.101
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

288
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:24.934
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been very weird to watch people </v>

289
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:27.550
<v Speaker 3>kind of invert that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

290
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 3>and I thought that that was unique to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left.</v>

291
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.064
<v Speaker 3>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been disabused of that pretty </v>

292
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:31.340
<v Speaker 3>radically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

293
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

294
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:33.560
<v Speaker 2>that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe,</v>

295
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 2>maybe my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

296
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.133
<v Speaker 2>feelings about what's happening with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left just kicked in a little bit more a </v>

297
00:12:39.411 --> 00:12:41.630
<v Speaker 2>little earlier than yours have kicked in</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the right thing.</v>

298
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's true because you are seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and it's pretty obvious.</v>

299
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.343
<v Speaker 2>I mean to me the issue will be that once</v>
<v Speaker 2>these trump people who have been </v>

300
00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:48.860
<v Speaker 2>offered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:12:48.861 --> 00:12:49.694
<v Speaker 2>against political correctness and free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech and all of this stuff and say </v>

302
00:12:52.431 --> 00:12:54.580
<v Speaker 2>what you're feeling about about which </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm for all of them,</v>

303
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.530
<v Speaker 2>but once on January 20th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>

304
00:12:57.531 --> 00:13:01.820
<v Speaker 2>those are the guys that are in power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will they be as uh,</v>

305
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.260
<v Speaker 2>for fighting the power?</v>

306
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.800
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somehow suspect.</v>

307
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:05.281
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

308
00:13:05.281 --> 00:13:06.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean Kellyanne Conway today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

309
00:13:06.751 --> 00:13:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean Kellyanne Conway was out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticizing a,</v>

310
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.700
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a bret Stevens from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street Journal.</v>

311
00:13:11.701 --> 00:13:12.534
<v Speaker 3>Bret Stevens from the Wall Street </v>
<v Speaker 3>Journal was making fun of Carly Fiorina </v>

312
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:14.874
<v Speaker 3>cause she went to trump tower and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>says like five minutes ago you were </v>

313
00:13:16.861 --> 00:13:19.530
<v Speaker 3>saying it was the worst person who ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>was and he was making fun your face.</v>

314
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.513
<v Speaker 3>And now here you are at trump tower and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kellyanne conway tweets back at Bret </v>

315
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Stephens and she said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really sexist.</v>

316
00:13:25.681 --> 00:13:27.420
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she tags Rupert Murdoch,</v>

317
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who owns the Wall Street Journal,</v>

318
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:29.563
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so is this the way that this is </v>

319
00:13:30.391 --> 00:13:32.970
<v Speaker 3>going to go now that we're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the bosses of the people who we don't</v>

320
00:13:32.971 --> 00:13:33.690
<v Speaker 3>like what they're saying,</v>

321
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.670
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's someone literally in the incoming</v>

322
00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:37.740
<v Speaker 2>administration tagging someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

323
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sean Hannity did the same thing today.</v>

324
00:13:39.381 --> 00:13:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Somebody red state criticized him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't like something that he did.</v>

325
00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.010
<v Speaker 3>So he immediately tagged the heads of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sales.</v>

326
00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:45.050
<v Speaker 3>The communications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tones,</v>

327
00:13:45.051 --> 00:13:45.884
<v Speaker 3>red state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like is this something that we </v>

328
00:13:47.121 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 3>want to engage in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

329
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.183
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not like I disagree with people </v>

330
00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:51.794
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I generally don't call for them to be </v>

331
00:13:53.781 --> 00:13:54.614
<v Speaker 3>fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

332
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

333
00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes like there was a point where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggested that there there should be,</v>

334
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.340
<v Speaker 3>if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they've left us,</v>

335
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:02.174
<v Speaker 3>we're going to apply certain tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to apply those same </v>

336
00:14:03.711 --> 00:14:04.544
<v Speaker 3>tactics to people on the left in order </v>
<v Speaker 3>to create a sort of mutually assured </v>

337
00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:09.320
<v Speaker 3>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not what's going on now.</v>

338
00:14:09.321 --> 00:14:10.154
<v Speaker 3>Now what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you criticized certain people and </v>

339
00:14:11.571 --> 00:14:12.404
<v Speaker 3>those people just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ought to be fired just for the </v>

340
00:14:13.011 --> 00:14:13.850
<v Speaker 3>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

341
00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:17.270
<v Speaker 3>I've never blocked anyone on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mute anybody on twitter.</v>

342
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.163
<v Speaker 3>So all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the evil terrible tweets that I </v>

343
00:14:19.221 --> 00:14:20.054
<v Speaker 3>received,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never called for anybody to be </v>

344
00:14:20.751 --> 00:14:22.310
<v Speaker 3>banned from twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you know,</v>

345
00:14:22.311 --> 00:14:23.330
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to the Adl,</v>

346
00:14:23.331 --> 00:14:26.160
<v Speaker 3>the number one recipient of antisemitism</v>
<v Speaker 3>or one line this year.</v>

347
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.620
<v Speaker 3>So I mean it did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've never,</v>

348
00:14:27.621 --> 00:14:30.440
<v Speaker 3>but that's not my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But watching people on my own side do it</v>

349
00:14:30.441 --> 00:14:30.981
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

350
00:14:30.981 --> 00:14:32.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should shut up because,</v>

351
00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:33.440
<v Speaker 3>because trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

352
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.281
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

353
00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:35.114
<v Speaker 3>That's not the way it works.</v>

354
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you win that battle?</v>

355
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

356
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.823
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

357
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.780
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

358
00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:43.190
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't be in this business.</v>

359
00:14:43.191 --> 00:14:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be in this business if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't think the battle we're winnable.</v>

360
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I think that in the afterglow of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an election,</v>

361
00:14:50.511 --> 00:14:53.670
<v Speaker 3>it's very for people to get past the </v>
<v Speaker 3>team sport of it and the,</v>

362
00:14:53.671 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 3>the warm feeling and the excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I immediately,</v>

363
00:14:56.421 --> 00:14:57.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you mentioned that night,</v>

364
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.513
<v Speaker 3>I kept going from excitement and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trepidation and excitement and </v>

365
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 3>trepidation to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

366
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:03.150
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe this was the election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

367
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people just went straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

368
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 3>we hate Hillary Clinton so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is now hunky Dory.</v>

369
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.250
<v Speaker 3>No problems anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump's here,</v>

370
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.113
<v Speaker 3>I alone can solve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that'll last up until the </v>

371
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 3>point where the pedal hits the metal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we'll see.</v>

372
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

373
00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.093
<v Speaker 3>What kind of policies he actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>implements and whether people are </v>

374
00:15:19.391 --> 00:15:20.224
<v Speaker 3>willing to stand up my bed is that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>fewer people will be willing to stand </v>

375
00:15:22.991 --> 00:15:23.820
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

376
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.653
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not back in when he does bad things </v>

377
00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:28.120
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you would have thought a year ago.</v>

378
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we shall see.</v>

379
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

380
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.910
<v Speaker 2>what's next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

381
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he becomes president,</v>

382
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.820
<v Speaker 2>he starts doing whatever he's doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left automatically,</v>

383
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:40.683
<v Speaker 2>and this has been my funeral along is if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you demonize someone to the point where </v>

384
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:46.360
<v Speaker 2>even if they do good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to keep demonizing them because</v>

385
00:15:46.361 --> 00:15:50.020
<v Speaker 2>if he's a racist bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if even if it reads to speak,</v>

386
00:15:50.021 --> 00:15:52.750
<v Speaker 2>it does good things for the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't be nice to him,</v>

387
00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:53.584
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's,</v>

388
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.590
<v Speaker 2>he's the scum of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens after this?</v>

389
00:15:56.591 --> 00:15:57.424
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems to me that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to start seeing more of a </v>

390
00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:04.180
<v Speaker 2>trend of violence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state coming down on more violence,</v>

391
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:07.480
<v Speaker 2>like it just seems like this is where </v>
<v Speaker 2>this has all been led up to and he's the</v>

392
00:16:07.481 --> 00:16:09.250
<v Speaker 2>guy to to lead the fight against.</v>

393
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

394
00:16:10.211 --> 00:16:13.050
<v Speaker 3>the level of radicalism that's emerged </v>
<v Speaker 3>on both sides in terms of the,</v>

395
00:16:13.051 --> 00:16:13.884
<v Speaker 3>the wild and tolerance for people with </v>
<v Speaker 3>different political opinions is pretty </v>

396
00:16:16.901 --> 00:16:18.260
<v Speaker 3>extreme as you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

397
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:20.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that if Democrats were smart,</v>

398
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.120
<v Speaker 3>they would actually see this as kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>an opportunity.</v>

399
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My guess is that trump's gonna govern as</v>

400
00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:24.994
<v Speaker 3>as more of a centrist Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he has is a hardcore right wing </v>

401
00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:27.394
<v Speaker 3>Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's talking about trillion </v>

402
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.863
<v Speaker 3>dollar infrastructure packages and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about tariffs and he's talking </v>

403
00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:32.980
<v Speaker 3>about a lot of Bernie sanders kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies.</v>

404
00:16:32.981 --> 00:16:34.130
<v Speaker 3>He's a populist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

405
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.830
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you could win.</v>

406
00:16:35.831 --> 00:16:36.664
<v Speaker 3>So what you could see Democrats is doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is doing exactly what they did to </v>

407
00:16:38.741 --> 00:16:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Herbert Hoover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it,</v>

408
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:41.140
<v Speaker 3>let's say if things go bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

409
00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:41.974
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if things go well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll be reelected because of president </v>

410
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.110
<v Speaker 3>who's president.</v>

411
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.820
<v Speaker 3>When things are going well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally is reelected.</v>

412
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.470
<v Speaker 3>But let's say things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say for the sake of argument,</v>

413
00:16:47.471 --> 00:16:50.350
<v Speaker 3>things don't go well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that just as as every eight to</v>

414
00:16:50.351 --> 00:16:52.660
<v Speaker 3>10 years for the last several decades in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this country,</v>

415
00:16:52.661 --> 00:16:55.660
<v Speaker 3>there's some sort of recession and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrats blame trump for it.</v>

416
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.943
<v Speaker 3>What they could do is they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>campaign on triple tripling down on the </v>

417
00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:01.031
<v Speaker 3>populism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

418
00:17:01.031 --> 00:17:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean they actually have that opening </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

419
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.250
<v Speaker 3>whereas they didn't before and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could actually do Fdr to hoover.</v>

420
00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:07.150
<v Speaker 3>They could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

421
00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:07.984
<v Speaker 3>hoover kind of implemented a lot of soft</v>
<v Speaker 3>fdr policies and then fdr came in and </v>

422
00:17:10.841 --> 00:17:13.150
<v Speaker 3>tripled down on everything and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>selected four straight times.</v>

423
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.133
<v Speaker 3>You could see Democrats doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>things shift really quickly in the </v>

424
00:17:16.061 --> 00:17:16.894
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Hillary did win by about 3 million </v>

425
00:17:17.861 --> 00:17:19.850
<v Speaker 3>popular votes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this isn't quite the,</v>

426
00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:22.810
<v Speaker 3>the massive majority that Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 3>are banking on.</v>

427
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do think that if their,</v>

428
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.570
<v Speaker 3>if their rhetoric is this extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

429
00:17:28.571 --> 00:17:31.570
<v Speaker 3>during the campaign the question is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be whether they ratcheted up or</v>

430
00:17:31.571 --> 00:17:34.810
<v Speaker 3>whether they sort of ratcheted down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wait to see what happens.</v>

431
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing some of both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing some about that.</v>

432
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.500
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I hope you're right.</v>

433
00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Like Harry Reid for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out and he says,</v>

434
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.253
<v Speaker 3>so far trump's not not that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is something that should make </v>

435
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:44.854
<v Speaker 3>conservatives a little concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Harry Reid says that you could see </v>

436
00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Democrats move in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not that.</v>

437
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.150
<v Speaker 3>And then things collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

438
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.480
<v Speaker 3>told you he was that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

439
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:52.703
<v Speaker 3>But the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they want to get some liberal </v>

440
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:55.230
<v Speaker 3>policy items from a lefty policy out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

441
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.573
<v Speaker 3>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in university campuses </v>

442
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.540
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the sort of extreme response,</v>

443
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:01.723
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think is going to get a lot </v>

444
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:03.294
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Democrats in government will </v>

445
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:05.184
<v Speaker 3>likely treat him with more moderation </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the election than they did before </v>

446
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 3>the election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's sort of been the pattern.</v>

447
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.300
<v Speaker 3>But the typical public is going to treat</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like we're,</v>

448
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.360
<v Speaker 3>we're now in an end of times </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicking.</v>

449
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess that,</v>

450
00:18:16.461 --> 00:18:18.950
<v Speaker 2>so that's an interesting distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the sort of leadership,</v>

451
00:18:18.951 --> 00:18:21.170
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the media or the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>leadership,</v>

452
00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.240
<v Speaker 2>may be willing to work with them in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>

453
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.313
<v Speaker 2>What they've ginned up something yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the populous that they may be can't </v>

454
00:18:27.531 --> 00:18:28.090
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

455
00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:28.923
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually you're seeing that battle </v>

456
00:18:29.531 --> 00:18:30.880
<v Speaker 3>play out in the Democratic Party right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

457
00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:31.714
<v Speaker 3>You've got the people who want to double</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and all the kind of identity </v>

458
00:18:33.461 --> 00:18:34.930
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric like Keith Ellison,</v>

459
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.153
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to double down on that and </v>

460
00:18:36.791 --> 00:18:38.170
<v Speaker 3>he's going to keep saying racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>

461
00:18:38.171 --> 00:18:39.004
<v Speaker 3>bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Homophobe let's get our coalition </v>

462
00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:40.744
<v Speaker 3>Together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Obama coalition will run somebody </v>

463
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:44.450
<v Speaker 3>who's not an old white lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next time we'll run cory booker,</v>

464
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.303
<v Speaker 3>Kamala Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we'll just sweep back to </v>

465
00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:49.060
<v Speaker 3>victory using this new coalition that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>demographically growing.</v>

466
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:50.103
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got people like Joe </v>
<v Speaker 3>Biden and some of the old guard </v>

467
00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.280
<v Speaker 3>Democrats who are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

468
00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.200
<v Speaker 3>hold on just a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we can actually,</v>

469
00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:57.034
<v Speaker 3>why are we abandoning all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these blue collar white voters who are </v>

470
00:18:59.261 --> 00:19:01.780
<v Speaker 3>voting for us until very recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

471
00:19:01.781 --> 00:19:03.700
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these counties went for Obama </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time.</v>

472
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.093
<v Speaker 3>And why don't we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't we try to draw them in by </v>

473
00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:09.730
<v Speaker 3>maybe working with trump and then if he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

474
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.833
<v Speaker 3>and then hitting him when we think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's over overly selling something or </v>

475
00:19:13.751 --> 00:19:15.580
<v Speaker 3>hitting him when things go bad and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

476
00:19:15.581 --> 00:19:17.710
<v Speaker 3>that conflict will really play out at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the DNC level.</v>

477
00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

478
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.473
<v Speaker 3>that's a fascinating,</v>

479
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

480
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.143
<v Speaker 2>I would bet everything that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go the Bernie Ellis and rooms </v>

481
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.213
<v Speaker 2>dump everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's any room for those </v>

482
00:19:26.641 --> 00:19:28.890
<v Speaker 2>people that you know for a gym where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Biden,</v>

483
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.260
<v Speaker 2>those happened to be two older white </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

484
00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:32.094
<v Speaker 2>but he's been anyone in that general </v>
<v Speaker 2>line of thinking blue dog Democrat is </v>

485
00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:34.690
<v Speaker 2>that right</v>

486
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.700
<v Speaker 3>now Jim Webb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

487
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.543
<v Speaker 3>I think Jim Webb's toast biden still </v>
<v Speaker 3>tries to straddle that gap a little bit </v>

488
00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.190
<v Speaker 3>and he gets away with it cause he's part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Obama administration.</v>

489
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

490
00:19:43.841 --> 00:19:44.674
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're going to be gradually </v>

491
00:19:45.371 --> 00:19:46.204
<v Speaker 3>drag to the left cause again in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire life the left has been gradually </v>

492
00:19:49.331 --> 00:19:50.164
<v Speaker 3>drag further and further to the left and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm waiting to see the moderates since </v>

493
00:19:52.331 --> 00:19:52.870
<v Speaker 3>Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been,</v>

494
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:53.010
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

495
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:53.843
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for a long time that the right </v>

496
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:56.430
<v Speaker 2>got dragged further in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

497
00:19:56.431 --> 00:19:58.650
<v Speaker 2>But this election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly they weren't.</v>

498
00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.221
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't.</v>

499
00:19:59.221 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 2>They were dragged the left actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty hard.</v>

500
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 2>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean trump doesn't,</v>

501
00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious he doesn't care about gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage,</v>

502
00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:04.674
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

503
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he cares about abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cares about weed.</v>

504
00:20:08.101 --> 00:20:11.130
<v Speaker 2>I think even some of the tax stuff I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is going to be a little more,</v>

505
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:13.020
<v Speaker 2>you write the ending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least centrist Democrat,</v>

506
00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I think he's going to govern a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Bill Clinton.</v>

507
00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he would govern like Ronald Reagan.</v>

508
00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:16.914
<v Speaker 2>That's the danger though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you demonize somebody to that end </v>

509
00:20:18.461 --> 00:20:19.294
<v Speaker 2>point and then even if they are with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>on so many of the things that you've </v>

510
00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:23.340
<v Speaker 2>been screaming about for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

511
00:20:23.341 --> 00:20:24.330
<v Speaker 2>you've painted yourself into that.</v>

512
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

513
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.023
<v Speaker 3>I think that's right and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrats have painted themselves in a </v>

514
00:20:27.771 --> 00:20:28.604
<v Speaker 3>little bit of a corner except that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just banking on the growth of </v>

515
00:20:31.251 --> 00:20:32.084
<v Speaker 3>the Obama coalition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They keep looking at the demographic </v>

516
00:20:33.051 --> 00:20:33.740
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

517
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.551
<v Speaker 3>and they keep thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

518
00:20:34.551 --> 00:20:38.720
<v Speaker 3>in 2020 40% of all voters will be of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>millennial generation.</v>

519
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.703
<v Speaker 3>Those people broke heavily for hilary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what's to stop us now and </v>

520
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.680
<v Speaker 3>demographics are not quite destinee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean demographic.</v>

521
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:47.990
<v Speaker 2>What a sad way</v>

522
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.823
<v Speaker 3>that would be to live as a society that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we would only be following the </v>

523
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:53.550
<v Speaker 3>demographic trend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what we are right now.</v>

524
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.750
<v Speaker 3>We've moved in such a tribal direction </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

525
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:56.584
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's easy to look at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>election cycle and look at did he went </v>

526
00:20:58.451 --> 00:20:59.284
<v Speaker 3>on policy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that the trump one on </v>

527
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:04.840
<v Speaker 3>policy so much as rejection of tribalism</v>
<v Speaker 3>in favor of another sort of tribalism.</v>

528
00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:05.674
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at how blue collar </v>
<v Speaker 3>white voters voted in this election </v>

529
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:13.120
<v Speaker 3>cycle by percentage white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a white working class.</v>

530
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.163
<v Speaker 3>People voted more for trump than </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hispanics voted for Hillary Clinton and </v>

531
00:21:17.351 --> 00:21:18.184
<v Speaker 3>people are constantly talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that Hispanics are voting </v>

532
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:21.131
<v Speaker 3>block.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

533
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:21.964
<v Speaker 3>well then so are white blue collar </v>
<v Speaker 3>people presumably and they voted </v>

534
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 3>precisely the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will be 71% for trump.</v>

535
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

536
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a problem with people with </v>
<v Speaker 3>any group voting,</v>

537
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:32.040
<v Speaker 3>however they want to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if,</v>

538
00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.880
<v Speaker 3>if it starts to look like a voting </v>
<v Speaker 3>block,</v>

539
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 3>like our group interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>solidarity,</v>

540
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:37.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's totally what's happening,</v>

541
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think is a bunch of white people</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting together and going,</v>

542
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to vote against this black and</v>

543
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Hispanic people.</v>

544
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.771
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like,</v>

545
00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:43.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that it's all Hispanic </v>
<v Speaker 3>people getting together.</v>

546
00:21:43.661 --> 00:21:44.920
<v Speaker 3>We need to vote against the white </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

547
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.760
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is that,</v>

548
00:21:46.761 --> 00:21:49.890
<v Speaker 3>that growing sense that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>vote inside your own block and it,</v>

549
00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:50.724
<v Speaker 3>and that is not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that's actually real </v>

550
00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:53.674
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because every time I watched John King </v>

551
00:21:54.641 --> 00:21:55.474
<v Speaker 3>with the Magic Wall that I'm pretty sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's having an affair with commercial </v>

552
00:21:58.151 --> 00:21:58.984
<v Speaker 3>breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every time I watch them do that and </v>

553
00:21:59.741 --> 00:21:59.981
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

554
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:00.814
<v Speaker 3>the white working class people here in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the black people here in the Latino </v>

555
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:04.270
<v Speaker 3>people here in this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

556
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.780
<v Speaker 3>not only does that actually sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound racist and I don't know,</v>

557
00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:10.930
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean it's actually just </v>
<v Speaker 3>pinning everyone by these,</v>

558
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.620
<v Speaker 3>these traits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

559
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 3>but it also doesn't sound logical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

560
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.133
<v Speaker 3>and maybe I'm really wrong here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think most people vote on </v>

561
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 3>the color of their skin or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so either.</v>

562
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.950
<v Speaker 3>But I think that they vote like their </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbors vote.</v>

563
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:24.963
<v Speaker 3>And so and so if they see that their </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbors are voting a certain way and </v>

564
00:22:27.131 --> 00:22:29.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain revenge politics to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

565
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 3>and this is not unique to one group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the system has screwed us.</v>

566
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.580
<v Speaker 3>This is the system has screwed us is one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ways that politics dies,</v>

567
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 3>that that notion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the system has screwed us.</v>

568
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.420
<v Speaker 3>And I don't just mean like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

569
00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:43.510
<v Speaker 3>if you can show that the government is </v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically disadvantage in your group,</v>

570
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you just say the system broadly</v>

571
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.480
<v Speaker 3>is screwing us and it's to us as white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue collar workers,</v>

572
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.450
<v Speaker 3>or it's us as black people or it's us as</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hispanics,</v>

573
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.460
<v Speaker 3>that's a really damaging thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

574
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 3>and that I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is rising pretty dramatically.</v>

575
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.043
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's partially because the only </v>

576
00:23:01.451 --> 00:23:02.284
<v Speaker 3>way that politics operates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've spoken about this at length </v>

577
00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:05.270
<v Speaker 3>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

578
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.153
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way that politics actually </v>

579
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:10.090
<v Speaker 3>operates and the way society operates is</v>
<v Speaker 3>through building of the social fabric.</v>

580
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:10.923
<v Speaker 3>The idea that we are individuals who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to treat each other as </v>

581
00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:13.024
<v Speaker 3>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to treat each other as </v>

582
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:14.404
<v Speaker 3>members of groups will have to spend so </v>
<v Speaker 3>long breaking people down into identity </v>

583
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:19.660
<v Speaker 3>group politics that the Wright responded</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it's own form of,</v>

584
00:23:19.661 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well screw you,</v>

585
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:21.101
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

586
00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:22.990
<v Speaker 3>you've already boxed us in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>

587
00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 3>now that we're in the box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in the box.</v>

588
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

589
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.310
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hated it for so long,</v>

590
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:29.160
<v Speaker 3>but now they're embracing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sleep.</v>

591
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried so hard to have the left back</v>

592
00:23:31.481 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Speaker 3>away from some of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

593
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:33.730
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

594
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 3>And I'd like to see the right back away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from some of this stuff.</v>

595
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:36.873
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outright controversy was about because </v>

596
00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Speaker 3>they're really open about the tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

597
00:23:41.201 --> 00:23:43.330
<v Speaker 3>there's no question that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that some of what trump was doing was,</v>

598
00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:44.740
<v Speaker 3>it was a quasi tribal appeal.</v>

599
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.321
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when,</v>

600
00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 3>when he was talking about tariffs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

601
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.980
<v Speaker 3>the terrorists that he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

602
00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:49.341
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

603
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:50.174
<v Speaker 3>he's saying that he obviously they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're equally applicable to people </v>

604
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:55.220
<v Speaker 3>living in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really who he's talking to,</v>

605
00:23:55.221 --> 00:23:56.054
<v Speaker 3>and everybody knew this and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeated ad nauseum in the media was </v>

606
00:23:57.921 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 3>he's talking to white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue collar voters from Ohio,</v>

607
00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michigan and Wisconsin.</v>

608
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:02.503
<v Speaker 3>And when you say to people that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>indirectly tax other people for your </v>

609
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 3>benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what a tariff is,</v>

610
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:08.803
<v Speaker 3>but it's okay for the white people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we also don't like the welfare </v>

611
00:24:10.701 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 3>system for the black people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you start getting into some really,</v>

612
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:14.984
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of interesting political territory </v>

613
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.600
<v Speaker 3>and the idea that it was a totally race </v>
<v Speaker 3>free campaign by trump is not true.</v>

614
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

615
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.140
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact is that Donald Trump was making</v>

616
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.330
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not overt references to race,</v>

617
00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:27.164
<v Speaker 3>but he was making subtle appeals on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>basis of race free campaign or there </v>

618
00:24:31.431 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there are people,</v>

619
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:33.104
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Kellyanne Conway to go to </v>

620
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:34.010
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

621
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.843
<v Speaker 3>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said there was a big debate between </v>

622
00:24:36.651 --> 00:24:38.960
<v Speaker 3>her and Jen Palmieri from the Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 3>campaign and Jen Palmieri,</v>

623
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 3>he said that you guys were pandering to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outright and Kellyanne Conway said,</v>

624
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:42.764
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're accusing me of being part of a </v>

625
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 3>campaign that would pander to the alt </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

626
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 3>And Jen Palmieri.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

627
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:47.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

628
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.010
<v Speaker 3>but Kelly entered the who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>

629
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:49.821
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

630
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

631
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:53.810
<v Speaker 3>you a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet at the same time,</v>

632
00:24:53.811 --> 00:24:56.180
<v Speaker 3>the Democrats were pandering to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody keeps saying,</v>

633
00:24:56.181 --> 00:24:58.460
<v Speaker 3>we don't exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't talk about race,</v>

634
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.310
<v Speaker 3>but every other line was raised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

635
00:25:01.311 --> 00:25:02.144
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you have both sides playing the </v>

636
00:25:03.591 --> 00:25:04.424
<v Speaker 3>same game now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and none of them are playing inside the </v>

637
00:25:05.601 --> 00:25:07.640
<v Speaker 3>mentality that we're where I exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>

638
00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:08.474
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put it outside the conservative box </v>

639
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:13.220
<v Speaker 3>for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am essentially a radical individualist</v>

640
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 3>in the sense that I think that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>ought to be treated as individuals.</v>

641
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.660
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't be treated as part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>

642
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 3>And so treating voters as part of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group or a classical liberal.</v>

643
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

644
00:25:21.861 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And did have that.</v>

645
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.073
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unlike the European style classical </v>

646
00:25:25.251 --> 00:25:25.980
<v Speaker 3>limmer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

647
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean except the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

648
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:27.824
<v Speaker 3>I mean with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with some really like the conservative </v>

649
00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:31.050
<v Speaker 3>thing enough that even to say that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

650
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.903
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more kind of a conservative </v>

651
00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:33.554
<v Speaker 3>libertarian mashup than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the government sucks at </v>

652
00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:35.661
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

653
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean like we've talked about same sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage before.</v>

654
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.190
<v Speaker 3>I personally against same sex marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think the government has any</v>

655
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:41.510
<v Speaker 3>business in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And personally,</v>

656
00:25:41.511 --> 00:25:42.321
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking marijuana,</v>

657
00:25:42.321 --> 00:25:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the government has pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>much any business in it.</v>

658
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.553
<v Speaker 3>If you're not creating extra analogies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that the government has </v>

659
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:47.834
<v Speaker 3>any business messing with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I can sit across from you </v>

660
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:50.924
<v Speaker 3>and you can say that and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>bother me because at this point you're </v>

661
00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Speaker 3>not trying to stop either one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

662
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:57.763
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

663
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:58.723
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can believe what you want to </v>

664
00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:00.650
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said that this is,</v>

665
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.850
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm supposed to be offended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

666
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.461
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is,</v>

667
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:05.294
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing that is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to somebody one time and </v>

668
00:26:06.591 --> 00:26:07.161
<v Speaker 3>they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

669
00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:08.180
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a religious person,</v>

670
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:10.940
<v Speaker 3>you think homosexual behavior is a sin </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a right,</v>

671
00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:11.751
<v Speaker 3>as an Orthodox Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

672
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 3>It's in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a sin.</v>

673
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.660
<v Speaker 3>Here's the beautiful thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

674
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.530
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to give a crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

675
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.050
<v Speaker 3>you can think I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

676
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Welcome to America and,</v>

677
00:26:19.391 --> 00:26:20.224
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't use seriously can completely </v>

678
00:26:21.831 --> 00:26:22.664
<v Speaker 3>disregard everything I'm saying because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to use a gun to enforce </v>

679
00:26:24.721 --> 00:26:25.554
<v Speaker 3>my opinion against you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually you're not even trying to </v>

680
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:29.330
<v Speaker 3>use the Bible because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

681
00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:31.310
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not trying to govern by the Bible.</v>

682
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's you're saying.</v>

683
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.403
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying you have your private </v>

684
00:26:34.371 --> 00:26:35.150
<v Speaker 3>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

685
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

686
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.143
<v Speaker 3>We lose this ability to have the private</v>
<v Speaker 3>league because did you see this about a </v>

687
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:40.550
<v Speaker 3>week ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

688
00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 3>buzzfeed did a piece on the two people </v>
<v Speaker 3>from that</v>

689
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Hg TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blanking on the show.</v>

690
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I watch it sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be one of the gains couple.</v>

691
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:49.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gaines,</v>

692
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 2>Joanna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I can remember,</v>

693
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't want your child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

694
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:53.491
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

695
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:56.570
<v Speaker 2>they do this house flipping show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be great flip or flop or,</v>

696
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.980
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

697
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.130
<v Speaker 2>but the point is that what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've watched the show many times,</v>

698
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 2>they strike me as two completely benign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

699
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Find people like their jobs seem like </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>

700
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.393
<v Speaker 2>And the whole piece in buzzfeed wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they go to a church that's against </v>

701
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:12.414
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought this is the worst kind of </v>

702
00:27:14.611 --> 00:27:16.940
<v Speaker 2>smear job nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

703
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when did that become,</v>

704
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:20.130
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>

705
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.053
<v Speaker 2>They go to a church where we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what their beliefs are on it and I </v>

706
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:24.120
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't care actually.</v>

707
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:24.721
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

708
00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:25.554
<v Speaker 3>And even if they believe that as long as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not manifesting that in </v>

709
00:27:27.191 --> 00:27:28.830
<v Speaker 3>discrimination against gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who gives a crap,</v>

710
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.491
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

711
00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:30.420
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous.</v>

712
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

713
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:34.130
<v Speaker 3>the idea that HDTV is short on pandering</v>
<v Speaker 3>to gay people isn't,</v>

714
00:27:34.131 --> 00:27:35.460
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Patently insane.</v>

715
00:27:35.461 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife watches HGTV.</v>

716
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:40.920
<v Speaker 3>We learned all about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's,</v>

717
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

718
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:42.600
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is amazing.</v>

719
00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:44.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean that sort of thought policing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

720
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's existed for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>decades,</v>

721
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.680
<v Speaker 3>probably since the 60s for the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that it's starting to exist</v>

722
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 3>a little bit on the right is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>frightens me is,</v>

723
00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:52.800
<v Speaker 3>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thought policing,</v>

724
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:53.813
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I see because policies become a </v>

725
00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:56.790
<v Speaker 3>loyalty test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also</v>

726
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:57.803
<v Speaker 2>so selective in what everyone does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I would guarantee you mentioned </v>

727
00:28:00.391 --> 00:28:01.224
<v Speaker 2>Keith Ellison a moment ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to guess that the mosque that </v>

728
00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:06.810
<v Speaker 2>he goes to is probably the mom is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not for gay marriage,</v>

729
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 2>but buzzfeed I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just guessing on that.</v>

730
00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 2>But I'm pretty sure that that's majority</v>
<v Speaker 2>mosques are not yet probably 99.9%</v>

731
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:14.370
<v Speaker 2>of mosques in America or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

732
00:28:14.371 --> 00:28:15.204
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can have their personal religious </v>

733
00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:17.664
<v Speaker 2>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but buzzfeed would never do a piece on </v>

734
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:20.124
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>

735
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.340
<v Speaker 2>they'll whitewash everything he's ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>said about fire can and everything else.</v>

736
00:28:23.341 --> 00:28:23.971
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

737
00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:25.890
<v Speaker 2>So that just shows you how the media </v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

738
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:26.470
<v Speaker 2>and I</v>

739
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.971
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did,</v>

740
00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:29.020
<v Speaker 3>they said that they were fine with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Obama's excuse.</v>

741
00:28:29.021 --> 00:28:29.854
<v Speaker 3>Then you went to a church for 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>where Jeremiah Wright was preaching the </v>

742
00:28:31.421 --> 00:28:33.460
<v Speaker 3>most insane crap imaginable from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulpit.</v>

743
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.301
<v Speaker 3>And they just went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

744
00:28:34.301 --> 00:28:34.631
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

745
00:28:34.631 --> 00:28:36.440
<v Speaker 3>that's his church and nobody says he has</v>
<v Speaker 3>to believe that.</v>

746
00:28:36.441 --> 00:28:36.851
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

747
00:28:36.851 --> 00:28:38.110
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does that,</v>

748
00:28:38.111 --> 00:28:39.980
<v Speaker 3>that's okay for Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not to confirm gains.</v>

749
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama is like the,</v>

750
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.370
<v Speaker 3>he's going to actually run for </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

751
00:28:42.371 --> 00:28:44.890
<v Speaker 3>Like if at any point the guy's views are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be relevant,</v>

752
00:28:44.891 --> 00:28:46.840
<v Speaker 3>you would think it's more of that then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

753
00:28:46.841 --> 00:28:47.674
<v Speaker 3>are you gonna knock out a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a barrier and create an open kitchen </v>

754
00:28:50.921 --> 00:28:52.760
<v Speaker 3>concept on HIV baby?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

755
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.800
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

756
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.491
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

757
00:28:54.491 --> 00:28:55.780
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is pretty,</v>

758
00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.640
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty wild how far things have </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>

759
00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm hoping that,</v>

760
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.003
<v Speaker 3>I think that a lot of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>hoping that trump is going to be a blow </v>

761
00:29:01.701 --> 00:29:02.640
<v Speaker 3>back against that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

762
00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.110
<v Speaker 3>that there'll be less thought policing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

763
00:29:05.111 --> 00:29:07.630
<v Speaker 3>under trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that also has to apply to trump,</v>

764
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:08.471
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

765
00:29:08.471 --> 00:29:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Then has to apply to trump himself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to apply to the chief.</v>

766
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.573
<v Speaker 2>When Kellyanne Conway's tagging people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bosses on twitter that they don't </v>

767
00:29:14.881 --> 00:29:15.631
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>

768
00:29:15.631 --> 00:29:16.140
<v Speaker 2>that's not a good thing.</v>

769
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.660
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump was making those noises all</v>

770
00:29:17.661 --> 00:29:18.530
<v Speaker 3>throughout the campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

771
00:29:18.531 --> 00:29:19.364
<v Speaker 3>He said he wants to rewrite libel law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which for people in our business is </v>

772
00:29:21.591 --> 00:29:22.371
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

773
00:29:22.371 --> 00:29:25.010
<v Speaker 3>all we do all day is sit and give </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions on people.</v>

774
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:27.830
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that we're going to be sued</v>
<v Speaker 3>for giving those opinions,</v>

775
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.641
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

776
00:29:28.641 --> 00:29:29.474
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is pretty frightening thing in the </v>

777
00:29:29.871 --> 00:29:30.650
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

778
00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't so much of that though,</v>

779
00:29:32.361 --> 00:29:33.194
<v Speaker 2>and I think you've already said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that it's just a reaction to the </v>

780
00:29:35.481 --> 00:29:36.050
<v Speaker 2>lunacy.</v>

781
00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump's reaction and the reaction to him</v>

782
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:39.290
<v Speaker 3>is reactionary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no question,</v>

783
00:29:39.291 --> 00:29:41.120
<v Speaker 3>but reactionary politics is bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>

784
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should have the,</v>

785
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.440
<v Speaker 3>the reaction to the left has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking people down by,</v>

786
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 3>by race and by identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Politics is not,</v>

787
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.151
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screw them.</v>

788
00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's do identity politics too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they can do what we can do it,</v>

789
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the,</v>

790
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.770
<v Speaker 3>that's not the way they got to play the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

791
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:54.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

792
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.470
<v Speaker 3>and if you think that's the only way we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can win,</v>

793
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 3>then we're bound for a European style </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>

794
00:29:58.961 --> 00:29:59.794
<v Speaker 3>It's the end of American politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what America used to be about was </v>

795
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:04.840
<v Speaker 3>the idea that as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we disagreed about a lot of things,</v>

796
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:06.850
<v Speaker 3>but we agreed that we were going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>treated as individuals,</v>

797
00:30:06.851 --> 00:30:08.710
<v Speaker 3>or at least that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was supposed to be the promise that</v>

798
00:30:08.711 --> 00:30:10.210
<v Speaker 3>we were attempting to fulfill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

799
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.143
<v Speaker 3>in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all breaks down according to </v>

800
00:30:11.711 --> 00:30:12.544
<v Speaker 3>demographic lines and you just have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle between the big government right </v>

801
00:30:14.281 --> 00:30:15.114
<v Speaker 3>in the big government left and are you </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to let in immigrants this time or </v>

802
00:30:16.811 --> 00:30:18.310
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get let in </v>
<v Speaker 3>immigrants this time?</v>

803
00:30:18.311 --> 00:30:19.060
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

804
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.893
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that we're in danger of </v>

805
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 3>moving that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just we're going to,</v>

806
00:30:22.361 --> 00:30:26.230
<v Speaker 3>we're going to show it and freight our </v>
<v Speaker 3>way right into something really ugly.</v>

807
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a weird way though,</v>

808
00:30:27.631 --> 00:30:29.640
<v Speaker 2>this presents a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>

809
00:30:29.641 --> 00:30:30.474
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling you right before we </v>

810
00:30:30.781 --> 00:30:32.430
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with you a couple of weeks ago,</v>

811
00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.940
<v Speaker 2>a Dennis prager had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a fundraiser and I thought he gave a</v>

812
00:30:35.941 --> 00:30:36.774
<v Speaker 2>really great speech about basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying the world is in a really nuts </v>

813
00:30:41.671 --> 00:30:44.400
<v Speaker 2>place right now and maybe we have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find allies and other places.</v>

814
00:30:44.401 --> 00:30:46.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I think I've tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

815
00:30:46.861 --> 00:30:49.530
<v Speaker 2>So there is for all the chaos of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

816
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.460
<v Speaker 2>there's some real life.</v>

817
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.181
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>

818
00:30:51.181 --> 00:30:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hope that it's,</v>

819
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.530
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a good opportunity for a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I do my podcast,</v>

820
00:30:55.531 --> 00:30:57.410
<v Speaker 3>I actually keep a physical shoe on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>side and I,</v>

821
00:30:57.411 --> 00:30:59.280
<v Speaker 3>and I hold it up and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put this on the other foot.</v>

822
00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.690
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever it trump does something.</v>

823
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.220
<v Speaker 3>So you just put this on there that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama did this,</v>

824
00:31:02.221 --> 00:31:03.054
<v Speaker 3>how would you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a good opportunity for people </v>

825
00:31:04.501 --> 00:31:05.334
<v Speaker 3>on the left to do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that if we all sort of take the </v>

826
00:31:07.441 --> 00:31:08.274
<v Speaker 3>shoe and put it on the other foot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like now you're very upset with what </v>

827
00:31:09.691 --> 00:31:10.830
<v Speaker 3>trump's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how are you with it?</v>

828
00:31:10.831 --> 00:31:12.000
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Obama was doing it,</v>

829
00:31:12.001 --> 00:31:12.930
<v Speaker 3>if you think is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when trump's doing,</v>

830
00:31:12.931 --> 00:31:15.180
<v Speaker 3>and maybe it was bad when Obama was </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it and for the right,</v>

831
00:31:15.181 --> 00:31:16.014
<v Speaker 3>if you were really pissed off about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>when Obama was doing it and now trump's </v>

832
00:31:17.791 --> 00:31:18.624
<v Speaker 3>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you should be pissed off when </v>

833
00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:20.614
<v Speaker 3>trump's doing it.</v>

834
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if everybody applied,</v>

835
00:31:21.841 --> 00:31:23.540
<v Speaker 3>that sort of intellectual honesty I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think to,</v>

836
00:31:23.541 --> 00:31:27.120
<v Speaker 3>to whatever our politicians do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd be significantly better off.</v>

837
00:31:27.121 --> 00:31:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Because the fact is that it's the team </v>
<v Speaker 3>sport of it,</v>

838
00:31:29.521 --> 00:31:30.354
<v Speaker 3>the ruins it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a team sport of it that where you </v>

839
00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:33.020
<v Speaker 3>end up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to root for,</v>

840
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.770
<v Speaker 3>for my guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just no matter what he does,</v>

841
00:31:34.771 --> 00:31:37.550
<v Speaker 3>no matter what rules he breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is why I've said it's not seems</v>

842
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.140
<v Speaker 3>more politics is not team sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as a white sox fan,</v>

843
00:31:40.141 --> 00:31:43.520
<v Speaker 3>there was a catcher who caught for us </v>
<v Speaker 3>named Aga presents gate at aeg presents.</v>

844
00:31:43.521 --> 00:31:44.354
<v Speaker 3>He was a player that everybody hated and</v>
<v Speaker 3>still hates in the major thing plays to </v>

845
00:31:46.831 --> 00:31:47.664
<v Speaker 3>the braves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they despise him cause he was this </v>

846
00:31:49.051 --> 00:31:51.780
<v Speaker 3>guy who had like cut any corner to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he's not on your team,</v>

847
00:31:51.781 --> 00:31:52.614
<v Speaker 3>you hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he's on your team and you'll </v>

848
00:31:53.041 --> 00:31:53.481
<v Speaker 3>love him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

849
00:31:53.481 --> 00:31:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything in order to win.</v>

850
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.370
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that when you apply that </v>
<v Speaker 3>to politics and it's,</v>

851
00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.330
<v Speaker 3>if he's on my team and he'll do anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>to win,</v>

852
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.680
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

853
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Well except for it isn't because now you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to,</v>

854
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.930
<v Speaker 3>you have to be standing up for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing bad things.</v>

855
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the strange thing.</v>

856
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:08.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

857
00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 2>if you were for all these people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are upset that Oh,</v>

858
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.940
<v Speaker 2>trump might be a warmonger or might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the press neck,</v>

859
00:32:14.941 --> 00:32:16.450
<v Speaker 2>he might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at this,</v>

860
00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:17.284
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't run certainly on on a pro war </v>

861
00:32:18.551 --> 00:32:19.384
<v Speaker 2>policy will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama has been doing drone strikes into </v>

862
00:32:21.641 --> 00:32:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strikes in Pakistan,</v>

863
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.143
<v Speaker 2>ask Edward Snowden how he's been for </v>
<v Speaker 2>press freedom and all that kind of </v>

864
00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:28.540
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So regardless of what,</v>

865
00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.220
<v Speaker 2>how were you feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible for press brakes.</v>

866
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

867
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.073
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why weren't you guys saying anything </v>

868
00:32:32.921 --> 00:32:33.880
<v Speaker 2>that you'd have a little more right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

869
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.890
<v Speaker 2>You'd have a little more weight to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>words now.</v>

870
00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.250
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said this on Brian stelter show on CNN</v>

871
00:32:38.251 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 3>is they were going over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is when,</v>

872
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 3>when trump was tweeting against </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hamilton,</v>

873
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.440
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

874
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.730
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's be fair to both sides.</v>

875
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:45.650
<v Speaker 3>If Obama had done this to a nascar </v>
<v Speaker 3>event,</v>

876
00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 3>like some Nascar event in 2011 boot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michelle,</v>

877
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:48.824
<v Speaker 3>and he'd gone on and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these Nascar people should shut up and </v>

878
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:51.830
<v Speaker 3>apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically,</v>

879
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:52.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would've been applauded,</v>

880
00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.590
<v Speaker 3>but he would have been applauded by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

881
00:32:54.591 --> 00:32:57.770
<v Speaker 3>And now trump does on Hamilton and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just the end of the world.</v>

882
00:32:57.771 --> 00:32:58.604
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to shut down our beloved </v>

883
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Hamilton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>

884
00:33:00.171 --> 00:33:01.730
<v Speaker 3>by the way is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an overrated musical.</v>

885
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.833
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

886
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.690
<v Speaker 3>but on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen it on the other side.</v>

887
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:06.261
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

888
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:07.430
<v Speaker 3>he had people on the right and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

889
00:33:07.431 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at trump.</v>

890
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.141
<v Speaker 3>Really punching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

891
00:33:09.141 --> 00:33:10.700
<v Speaker 3>really taking it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

892
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:13.370
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when Obama did exactly the same sort</v>

893
00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:15.500
<v Speaker 3>of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was calling out Fox News by name</v>

894
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:19.010
<v Speaker 3>and saying that it was that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroying the political process,</v>

895
00:33:19.011 --> 00:33:19.610
<v Speaker 3>we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

896
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:20.443
<v Speaker 3>the the president of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be going out and attacking </v>

897
00:33:21.531 --> 00:33:23.480
<v Speaker 3>specific news outlets for how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>report.</v>

898
00:33:23.481 --> 00:33:24.620
<v Speaker 3>That's really gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny.</v>

899
00:33:24.621 --> 00:33:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I had somebody tweet me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why didn't you ever say this stuff about</v>

900
00:33:26.841 --> 00:33:27.674
<v Speaker 3>Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I linked directly to a video from </v>

901
00:33:29.061 --> 00:33:33.020
<v Speaker 3>2013 I said exactly this about Obama and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in again,</v>

902
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.580
<v Speaker 3>you could probably spend your whole life</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to correct the things that people</v>

903
00:33:35.581 --> 00:33:36.414
<v Speaker 3>tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what happens is that people </v>

904
00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:38.180
<v Speaker 3>get into this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

905
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:38.661
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

906
00:33:38.661 --> 00:33:41.180
<v Speaker 3>they get into this mode where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

907
00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:43.610
<v Speaker 3>when Obama did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the Democrats didn't care.</v>

908
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.391
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

909
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:45.920
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that argument also applies to you.</v>

910
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.890
<v Speaker 3>You did care when Obama did it and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pretending not to.</v>

911
00:33:48.891 --> 00:33:51.140
<v Speaker 3>So the hypocrisy argument cuts both </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

912
00:33:51.141 --> 00:33:51.974
<v Speaker 3>It's double edged sword.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't claim the Democrats are </v>

913
00:33:52.941 --> 00:33:53.774
<v Speaker 3>hypocrites about trump at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're being a hypocrite about </v>

914
00:33:55.551 --> 00:33:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

915
00:33:56.631 --> 00:33:57.464
<v Speaker 3>so let's shift away from a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the horse race pilot from broader </v>

916
00:34:00.741 --> 00:34:01.940
<v Speaker 3>themes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the free speech stuff,</v>

917
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.280
<v Speaker 3>you have been in the thick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

918
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:05.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to party truly,</v>

919
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 3>truly in the thick of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get protested at pretty much every,</v>

920
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.600
<v Speaker 3>when's the last time you were at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>university that you weren't protests?</v>

921
00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:11.850
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say half the universities.</v>

922
00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.180
<v Speaker 3>I go try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I protest protested.</v>

923
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean I go to a lot of universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

924
00:34:14.621 --> 00:34:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've spoken at 10 in the last two months</v>

925
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:17.630
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>

926
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 3>I guess I only hear about the one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we only see the headlines about the ones</v>

927
00:34:20.301 --> 00:34:22.700
<v Speaker 3>where there are heavy protests had taken</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a third of them.</v>

928
00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:24.080
<v Speaker 3>I get heavy protests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

929
00:34:24.081 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Speaker 3>So about a third of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting heavy protests now.</v>

930
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:27.643
<v Speaker 3>I would venture to say that for everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's listening to this interview so </v>

931
00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 3>far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they agree with you or not,</v>

932
00:34:31.041 --> 00:34:35.060
<v Speaker 3>you don't seem to be a hate monger or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of white supremacist or Jewish</v>

933
00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:38.290
<v Speaker 3>supremacist or some other Nazi related </v>
<v Speaker 3>something or other like,</v>

934
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.150
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are these people thinking?</v>

935
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.910
<v Speaker 3>What do you really think is going on for</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people?</v>

936
00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:46.100
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's a lot of misguided nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

937
00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.160
<v Speaker 3>and I've spoke at Ucla with Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a whole separate crowd.</v>

938
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:51.410
<v Speaker 3>Your crowd obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

939
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:53.480
<v Speaker 3>but there are protesting him too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

940
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that the,</v>

941
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.113
<v Speaker 3>for the most part people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't assume my own level of </v>

942
00:34:58.941 --> 00:34:59.774
<v Speaker 3>notoriety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that most of the people who </v>

943
00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:02.120
<v Speaker 3>are protesting me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard anything that I've said</v>

944
00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:03.110
<v Speaker 3>or read anything that I've written.</v>

945
00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:05.901
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

946
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:06.734
<v Speaker 3>When I was at Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that a lot of the </v>

947
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:08.804
<v Speaker 3>fliers come out and the fliers put like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most provocative title they can to </v>

948
00:35:10.821 --> 00:35:11.654
<v Speaker 3>get people to come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

949
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then usually that they're,</v>

950
00:35:14.271 --> 00:35:14.991
<v Speaker 3>they're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it did.</v>

951
00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:15.900
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

952
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.080
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin,</v>

953
00:35:18.081 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 3>I had people getting up and chanting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a guy right at the beginning stand</v>

954
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:25.520
<v Speaker 3>up and say something about how I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>enabling Hitler.</v>

955
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.451
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

956
00:35:26.451 --> 00:35:27.650
<v Speaker 3>do you see the Yamaka?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are,</v>

957
00:35:27.651 --> 00:35:30.170
<v Speaker 3>what are you even talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you talking about?</v>

958
00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.290
<v Speaker 3>And then they were chanting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were chanting f white supremacy.</v>

959
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:33.521
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

960
00:35:33.521 --> 00:35:34.354
<v Speaker 3>it's like I've been spending this entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>election cycle under assault from the </v>

961
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:39.060
<v Speaker 3>white supremacists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

962
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.220
<v Speaker 3>Because I told them that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're wrong.</v>

963
00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:42.054
<v Speaker 3>And I think that they're evil and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and literally the number one online </v>

964
00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:48.250
<v Speaker 3>target of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

965
00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:48.930
<v Speaker 3>so how about right?</v>

966
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:49.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

967
00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

968
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.010
<v Speaker 3>but I'm getting protested by it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the,</v>

969
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 3>by the blm crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>

970
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.203
<v Speaker 3>I think that it comes from ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it comes from this place where </v>

971
00:35:58.711 --> 00:36:02.640
<v Speaker 3>any opposing view must be attacked and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't even have to do our research.</v>

972
00:36:02.641 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to try and debunk it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunking.</v>

973
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 3>It actually takes effort going and </v>
<v Speaker 3>yelling about it doesn't take any effort</v>

974
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:08.334
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why whenever I do these </v>

975
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:11.430
<v Speaker 3>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I do when we do q and,</v>

976
00:36:11.431 --> 00:36:11.881
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I say,</v>

977
00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:13.620
<v Speaker 3>if you disagree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to go first.</v>

978
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.780
<v Speaker 3>All people who disagree go to the front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the line and it's and it,</v>

979
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.713
<v Speaker 3>cause that's always more interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I treat the people who disagree with me </v>

980
00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:22.470
<v Speaker 3>actually with respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not,</v>

981
00:36:22.471 --> 00:36:25.380
<v Speaker 3>if you're not yelling at me and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not flipping me off and shutting f white</v>

982
00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:26.214
<v Speaker 3>supremacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to treat you with respect and </v>

983
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 3>have a civil discussion.</v>

984
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.690
<v Speaker 3>I do it all the time and that's the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can win over.</v>

985
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:31.613
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

986
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 3>It's selfishly rewarding for you because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the guy who was on the fence that</v>

987
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:39.030
<v Speaker 3>might come to your thigh or at the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>least we can have a discussion where the</v>

988
00:36:39.031 --> 00:36:40.830
<v Speaker 3>person gives a point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the counterpoint and all the,</v>

989
00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Speaker 3>all the whole audience is smarter for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

990
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.983
<v Speaker 3>that the audience is not smarter for </v>
<v Speaker 3>having these people chance and stand in </v>

991
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:46.944
<v Speaker 3>front of the stage and try to disrupt an</v>
<v Speaker 3>event and me write more ons on the trop </v>

992
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:51.180
<v Speaker 3>board behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

993
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 3>it's fun for me and I think it's fun for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crowd,</v>

994
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:54.024
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not informative in any way </v>

995
00:36:55.771 --> 00:36:57.720
<v Speaker 3>except to show that there are these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are out there.</v>

996
00:36:58.410 --> 00:36:59.243
<v Speaker 3>How does it feel just just on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal level when this stuff's </v>

997
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:01.640
<v Speaker 3>happening?</v>

998
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Cause there are threats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

999
00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:03.610
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was at Ucla,</v>

1000
00:37:03.611 --> 00:37:06.030
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a bomb threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People bashing on the door,</v>

1001
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.490
<v Speaker 3>seemed like they were coming in </v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming like we didn't know if by,</v>

1002
00:37:08.491 --> 00:37:09.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1003
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:11.510
<v Speaker 3>anything violent could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all that stuff.</v>

1004
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Like just on a purely personal note,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are a person,</v>

1005
00:37:14.251 --> 00:37:16.530
<v Speaker 3>you're a relatively new father I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1006
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got two kids in three years.</v>

1007
00:37:17.771 --> 00:37:18.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1008
00:37:18.201 --> 00:37:19.034
<v Speaker 3>So just on that note,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like putting yourself out there like </v>

1009
00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:22.560
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you make of that?</v>

1010
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.011
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1011
00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:24.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't tell my wife about it.</v>

1012
00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.980
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she not on twitter,</v>

1013
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.640
<v Speaker 3>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She does not do the facebook thing.</v>

1014
00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:31.090
<v Speaker 3>I off everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1015
00:37:31.091 --> 00:37:31.771
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1016
00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:32.251
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

1017
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:34.020
<v Speaker 3>she's kind of protected from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1018
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:34.883
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm usually the safest </v>

1019
00:37:36.571 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 3>person in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the only guy there were security,</v>

1020
00:37:38.191 --> 00:37:38.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1021
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.940
<v Speaker 3>So I've got my own private security,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1022
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.300
<v Speaker 3>that we contract to do these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first time we did it,</v>

1023
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are we even doing this?</v>

1024
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.410
<v Speaker 3>And turned out that was cal state La and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like an actual riot there.</v>

1025
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.360
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

1026
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm now,</v>

1027
00:37:49.471 --> 00:37:52.050
<v Speaker 3>I've got security guys who come with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1028
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm always relieved when it's not that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>

1029
00:37:54.511 --> 00:37:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I would much prefer to have just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>

1030
00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.480
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not looking for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really am not looking for the headline</v>

1031
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:01.314
<v Speaker 3>that says protesters come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shapiro finishes protesters or whatever </v>

1032
00:38:03.151 --> 00:38:04.110
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

1033
00:38:04.111 --> 00:38:06.060
<v Speaker 3>that's easy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not hard.</v>

1034
00:38:06.061 --> 00:38:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Like these people have a combined icu in</v>
<v Speaker 3>single digits.</v>

1035
00:38:08.641 --> 00:38:11.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not difficult to make stupid people</v>
<v Speaker 3>look stupid.</v>

1036
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.233
<v Speaker 3>It's more difficult to actually have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with somebody who has a </v>

1037
00:38:14.671 --> 00:38:15.900
<v Speaker 3>point of view and some facts to back </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1038
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.050
<v Speaker 3>I was more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1039
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:17.903
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as the personal safety aspect of </v>

1040
00:38:19.291 --> 00:38:20.124
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1041
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.571
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>

1042
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:22.404
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't concern me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's physical safety as much as just </v>

1043
00:38:23.791 --> 00:38:25.550
<v Speaker 3>sort of your men mostly puzzled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1044
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:26.820
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1045
00:38:26.821 --> 00:38:27.654
<v Speaker 3>Like what am I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm here preaching decency and non </v>

1046
00:38:30.121 --> 00:38:32.520
<v Speaker 3>identity group politics and I'm getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>protested for that.</v>

1047
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Like I have people yelling at me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>threatening violence because of that.</v>

1048
00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could understand if I were coming here</v>

1049
00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:38.780
<v Speaker 3>and I was saying something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's you know,</v>

1050
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.590
<v Speaker 3>actively calling for violence or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something or even implying that violence</v>

1051
00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:42.424
<v Speaker 3>is okay in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But half of my speeches are about why </v>

1052
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:45.440
<v Speaker 3>violence is never okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1053
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't get to hit people if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with them.</v>

1054
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.483
<v Speaker 3>And then to prove my point that come and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they try and hit people who disagree </v>

1055
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:50.260
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

1056
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.150
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so bizarre.</v>

1057
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where were you with the,</v>

1058
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.480
<v Speaker 3>with Christina Hoff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sommers Paul.</v>

1059
00:38:55.481 --> 00:38:56.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul.</v>

1060
00:38:56.381 --> 00:38:58.480
<v Speaker 3>Which depaul is banned by low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1061
00:38:58.481 --> 00:38:58.871
<v Speaker 3>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1062
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:01.810
<v Speaker 3>well they ban Milo and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately banned me on top of that.</v>

1063
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like housing.</v>

1064
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.510
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1065
00:39:03.511 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 3>and then first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is absurd.</v>

1066
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:06.124
<v Speaker 3>They Ban Milo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows about the disagreements </v>

1067
00:39:08.051 --> 00:39:09.310
<v Speaker 3>that I have with my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's absurd.</v>

1068
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.233
<v Speaker 3>Milo getting banned from campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it makes me really happy </v>

1069
00:39:12.071 --> 00:39:13.510
<v Speaker 3>because the headline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1070
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's stupidity of the highest order.</v>

1071
00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you disagree with him,</v>

1072
00:39:17.441 --> 00:39:18.910
<v Speaker 3>go into bunk him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1073
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.260
<v Speaker 3>if you disagree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't show up.</v>

1074
00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:21.094
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be the worst thing you can do to </v>

1075
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Milo is just not show up for one of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>lectures.</v>

1076
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's it.</v>

1077
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.570
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1078
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 3>they banned me on top of that at Depaul.</v>

1079
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.473
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they didn't even give it like </v>

1080
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.830
<v Speaker 3>they're only excuse was the security and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1081
00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:35.080
<v Speaker 3>he can't control your own students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not my fault.</v>

1082
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:36.640
<v Speaker 3>That's your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a university.</v>

1083
00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Should be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you can go view the video.</v>

1084
00:39:38.681 --> 00:39:39.850
<v Speaker 3>They actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1085
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.860
<v Speaker 3>we announced that Christina was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be speaking there and I was going to,</v>

1086
00:39:42.861 --> 00:39:43.694
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accompany her and they wouldn't let me </v>

1087
00:39:45.101 --> 00:39:45.934
<v Speaker 3>in the building as a guest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't let me in the building as </v>

1088
00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.184
<v Speaker 3>a member of her team and they wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>let me in the building and just sit in </v>

1089
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:50.344
<v Speaker 3>the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they saying to you at that </v>

1090
00:39:51.521 --> 00:39:53.980
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they saying because their people are</v>

1091
00:39:53.981 --> 00:39:56.260
<v Speaker 3>threatening violence and there were no </v>
<v Speaker 3>threats of violence?</v>

1092
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:57.094
<v Speaker 3>That was what was amazing at Depaul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we walked up and the whole day </v>

1093
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:00.064
<v Speaker 3>they'd been telling my security team </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if Shapiro shows up that we're </v>

1094
00:40:02.411 --> 00:40:03.100
<v Speaker 3>going to arrest him.</v>

1095
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 3>If he shows up then we will literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>and at the,</v>

1096
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:08.400
<v Speaker 3>at the place for trespass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1097
00:40:08.401 --> 00:40:10.870
<v Speaker 3>So I mean that would be the crime is </v>
<v Speaker 3>trespassing on their campus.</v>

1098
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.823
<v Speaker 3>They literally went out and got a share </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Cook County to sit there to </v>

1099
00:40:13.841 --> 00:40:16.930
<v Speaker 3>facilitate the transfer of arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the campus police arrest you,</v>

1100
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:19.260
<v Speaker 3>they have to have somebody from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>county actually be,</v>

1101
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.113
<v Speaker 3>it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the guy sitting there in the </v>

1102
00:40:20.741 --> 00:40:22.630
<v Speaker 3>law?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No protesters anywhere.</v>

1103
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.530
<v Speaker 3>None.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1104
00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:28.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's 30 police officers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>security guards and me and I walk up and</v>

1105
00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:29.620
<v Speaker 3>I was like really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't it like Sofa.</v>

1106
00:40:29.621 --> 00:40:30.530
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1107
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.290
<v Speaker 3>if I take two steps forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going to arrest me?</v>

1108
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:34.270
<v Speaker 3>And the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah and giant guy.</v>

1109
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:35.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were like,</v>

1110
00:40:35.861 --> 00:40:36.740
<v Speaker 3>you should have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should have gotten arrested.</v>

1111
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.653
<v Speaker 3>It's like well you know at that point </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really not so hot on spending the </v>

1112
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:41.500
<v Speaker 3>evening.</v>

1113
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.740
<v Speaker 3>And They Cook County prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cook County jail for the,</v>

1114
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.050
<v Speaker 3>for the of your beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not to the point of,</v>

1115
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:48.423
<v Speaker 3>well again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually have the right to arrest </v>

1116
00:40:50.321 --> 00:40:51.220
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a private university.</v>

1117
00:40:51.221 --> 00:40:52.510
<v Speaker 3>If it were a public university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have walked,</v>

1118
00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.040
<v Speaker 3>if you were in private,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a Republican diversity,</v>

1119
00:40:54.041 --> 00:40:56.260
<v Speaker 3>I would have made them arrest me at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>private university.</v>

1120
00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 3>They do have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do have the legal right to,</v>

1121
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:02.440
<v Speaker 3>to band whoever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just demonstrates how ridiculous they</v>

1122
00:41:02.441 --> 00:41:04.960
<v Speaker 3>are that they're willing to arrest me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that again,</v>

1123
00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:09.670
<v Speaker 3>that they're taking everyone from you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>milo,</v>

1124
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:13.030
<v Speaker 3>it's like that's showing real </v>
<v Speaker 3>intolerance.</v>

1125
00:41:13.031 --> 00:41:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's not just a sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just [inaudible].</v>

1126
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:18.970
<v Speaker 3>It's people that disagree wildly on </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1127
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.620
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they except,</v>

1128
00:41:20.621 --> 00:41:23.680
<v Speaker 3>except if they are remotely construed as</v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing.</v>

1129
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:24.521
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're,</v>

1130
00:41:24.521 --> 00:41:25.354
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a terrorist convicted in </v>

1131
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can speak at a,</v>

1132
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.610
<v Speaker 3>they had one speaker in 2014 I think at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Depaul.</v>

1133
00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:31.683
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to be within a certain </v>

1134
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.573
<v Speaker 3>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they refused to even acknowledge a </v>

1135
00:41:35.601 --> 00:41:36.434
<v Speaker 3>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1136
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.300
<v Speaker 3>Although depaul actually did write </v>
<v Speaker 3>depaul,</v>

1137
00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:39.134
<v Speaker 3>depaul came out later and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they tried to distinguish kind of </v>

1138
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:42.590
<v Speaker 3>what I say from what Milo says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of interesting.</v>

1139
00:41:42.591 --> 00:41:45.110
<v Speaker 3>But that didn't change their behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to actually let me speak.</v>

1140
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:45.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1141
00:41:45.871 --> 00:41:47.550
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just do the Milo thing quick.</v>

1142
00:41:47.551 --> 00:41:48.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to dwell on it,</v>

1143
00:41:48.751 --> 00:41:50.130
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so many people ask.</v>

1144
00:41:50.131 --> 00:41:52.770
<v Speaker 2>So for the record that you sitting here </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1145
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I will fully say what I've said many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times on twitter,</v>

1146
00:41:55.171 --> 00:41:59.250
<v Speaker 2>which is that my low had the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of doing it.</v>

1147
00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.830
<v Speaker 2>He sent an email to our team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1148
00:42:01.831 --> 00:42:03.780
<v Speaker 2>let's do this debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and Ben,</v>

1149
00:42:03.781 --> 00:42:06.150
<v Speaker 2>table moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you immediately responded,</v>

1150
00:42:06.151 --> 00:42:07.500
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gave dates.</v>

1151
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.920
<v Speaker 2>And then Milo basically dipped out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>says the truth.</v>

1152
00:42:10.921 --> 00:42:11.754
<v Speaker 2>As much as I know it</v>

1153
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.870
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1154
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:14.830
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1155
00:42:14.831 --> 00:42:15.664
<v Speaker 3>and then went around the country </v>
<v Speaker 3>proclaiming that I had chicken down and </v>

1156
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:23.230
<v Speaker 3>trying to derive this rivalry with me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I could not care less about.</v>

1157
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Like Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish nothing but success to,</v>

1158
00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:28.090
<v Speaker 3>to my low based on the good things he </v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

1159
00:42:28.091 --> 00:42:28.924
<v Speaker 3>I hope nothing but failure for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for bad things that he does just like </v>

1160
00:42:30.851 --> 00:42:33.640
<v Speaker 3>anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

1161
00:42:33.641 --> 00:42:35.350
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as in,</v>

1162
00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:36.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to play Lucy and the </v>

1163
00:42:37.481 --> 00:42:40.060
<v Speaker 3>football with him and he ducked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He chickened out.</v>

1164
00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:41.620
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>

1165
00:42:41.621 --> 00:42:42.454
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact is that even the fact I was </v>

1166
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:44.644
<v Speaker 3>willing to do it in the first place </v>
<v Speaker 3>after he was tweeting pictures of me as </v>

1167
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.850
<v Speaker 3>a black baby on the day that my son was </v>
<v Speaker 3>born because I'm a cock,</v>

1168
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.500
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a bit generous.</v>

1169
00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:53.050
<v Speaker 3>But then now that I'm not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna play that game.</v>

1170
00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:53.850
<v Speaker 3>That's not my game.</v>

1171
00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:54.683
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I genuinely liked both of you and I </v>

1172
00:42:56.761 --> 00:42:58.290
<v Speaker 2>think we could have done something </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

1173
00:42:58.291 --> 00:43:00.300
<v Speaker 2>I have my own coming back in in </v>
<v Speaker 2>February.</v>

1174
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my guess is that the ground,</v>

1175
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:03.390
<v Speaker 2>the ground is a little too scorch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:43:03.391 --> 00:43:04.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested.</v>

1177
00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:05.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1178
00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:06.554
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested in doing the Charlie </v>

1179
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.860
<v Speaker 3>Brown lucy routine so that he can go </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the country proclaiming that he's</v>

1180
00:43:09.861 --> 00:43:11.210
<v Speaker 3>brave after having checked it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:13.010
<v Speaker 2>And for the record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he comes in in February,</v>

1182
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll say the exact same thing to him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can say,</v>

1183
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:17.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1184
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.560
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1185
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.453
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be very sophisticated in British </v>

1186
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:21.450
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1187
00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:22.523
<v Speaker 2>the alt right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I have done a couple of videos on </v>

1188
00:43:24.711 --> 00:43:26.630
<v Speaker 2>the alt right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I general feeling,</v>

1189
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 2>although I think something is changing </v>
<v Speaker 2>now that trump is in power,</v>

1190
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.460
<v Speaker 2>is that for the months leading up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>

1191
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:32.533
<v Speaker 2>this was mostly a bunch of shit posters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was mostly a bunch of anonymous four </v>

1192
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:41.531
<v Speaker 2>Chan and reddit people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not really white supremacists and</v>

1193
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:42.494
<v Speaker 2>neo Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were some of these people in the </v>

1194
00:43:43.581 --> 00:43:44.414
<v Speaker 2>mix of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just people who were home in </v>

1195
00:43:46.821 --> 00:43:50.240
<v Speaker 2>their basements or wherever that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweeting at people in power media,</v>

1196
00:43:50.241 --> 00:43:52.100
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians to upset everybody,</v>

1197
00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 2>to get them retweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get everyone to show,</v>

1198
00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm such a victim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at me,</v>

1199
00:43:55.641 --> 00:43:57.560
<v Speaker 2>look what's happening to me online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm separate.</v>

1200
00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 2>And basically what I've said is if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with some of these issues,</v>

1201
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:02.390
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like immigration or Islam,</v>

1202
00:44:02.391 --> 00:44:03.224
<v Speaker 2>Islam or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how we'll defang some of the </v>

1203
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.470
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric around all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think there's truth to that.</v>

1204
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.333
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's starting to shift a little </v>

1205
00:44:11.571 --> 00:44:14.000
<v Speaker 2>bit now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that trump won the election,</v>

1206
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:14.841
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1207
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:15.674
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's truth to that.</v>

1208
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.513
<v Speaker 3>So what I've distinguished in interviews</v>
<v Speaker 3>or talking about this is the outright </v>

1209
00:44:20.031 --> 00:44:23.730
<v Speaker 3>philosophers and promulgators Milo's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem we had of the alt right.</v>

1210
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he denies head,</v>

1211
00:44:25.281 --> 00:44:26.750
<v Speaker 3>but he likes to play the clown nose off </v>
<v Speaker 3>clown nose,</v>

1212
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:29.200
<v Speaker 3>offer a teen and clown nose on clown </v>
<v Speaker 3>nose offers him with the outright.</v>

1213
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.721
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

1214
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:30.554
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really a member of the outright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just write stories giving they're </v>

1215
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:33.790
<v Speaker 3>expressing their viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh Huh.</v>

1216
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1217
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:36.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1218
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:37.074
<v Speaker 3>the piece that he wrote for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Breitbart about the outright is a </v>

1219
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:41.460
<v Speaker 3>really definitive piece about what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>alt right is.</v>

1220
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:42.623
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that for the most part it's </v>

1221
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:44.620
<v Speaker 3>pretty accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1222
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.130
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1223
00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:45.963
<v Speaker 3>the outright philosophy isn't a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who consider themselves outright </v>

1224
00:44:47.881 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 3>right or not technically outright right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

1225
00:44:49.711 --> 00:44:50.670
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit posters,</v>

1226
00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:50.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1227
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:51.683
<v Speaker 3>There are people who have been drawn in </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the idea that they're being </v>

1228
00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 3>politically incorrect and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>violating taboos.</v>

1229
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:56.454
<v Speaker 3>And it's kind of fun to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's very teenagery and all this </v>

1230
00:44:57.841 --> 00:44:58.880
<v Speaker 3>kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1231
00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 3>the people who are actually hardcore old</v>
<v Speaker 3>writers,</v>

1232
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.303
<v Speaker 3>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milo,</v>

1233
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:04.590
<v Speaker 3>he knows that her philosophy and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about it and that piece,</v>

1234
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:05.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people,</v>

1235
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.320
<v Speaker 3>the Richard Spencers and the jury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taylor's and all those groups,</v>

1236
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 3>those people out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our actual honest to God,</v>

1237
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:09.714
<v Speaker 3>white supremacists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a line in that piece where </v>

1238
00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:11.544
<v Speaker 3>he talks about about civil as Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization being inseparable from </v>

1239
00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:16.230
<v Speaker 3>ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1240
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.440
<v Speaker 3>which is white supremacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1241
00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:20.010
<v Speaker 3>That that is definition of white </v>
<v Speaker 3>supremacy.</v>

1242
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.860
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the philosophy,</v>

1243
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.310
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people consider themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>outright,</v>

1244
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.273
<v Speaker 3>had been dragged into that by people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been inaccurate in their </v>

1245
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 3>definitions of the alt right.</v>

1246
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 3>So instead of just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1247
00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:31.284
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who actually believe this </v>

1248
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:33.174
<v Speaker 3>white supremacist crap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they're a bunch of people who </v>

1249
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:37.650
<v Speaker 3>are just posting stupid stuff online to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get a rise out of people.</v>

1250
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.053
<v Speaker 3>They had conflate the two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what's even worse is that you </v>

1251
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:42.324
<v Speaker 3>get people who are legit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know conservatives who don't know </v>

1252
00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:47.490
<v Speaker 3>what the alt right is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they assume that everybody who is</v>

1253
00:45:47.491 --> 00:45:48.324
<v Speaker 3>antiestablishment is outright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that gives them a number that </v>

1254
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:52.470
<v Speaker 3>they don't actually hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1255
00:45:52.471 --> 00:45:54.860
<v Speaker 3>The number of people who are definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are really outright,</v>

1256
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:58.740
<v Speaker 3>like the people who actually believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>white nationalism or white superiority,</v>

1257
00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.230
<v Speaker 3>that's a really small number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

1258
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:04.410
<v Speaker 3>And then they've built themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've kind of built this,</v>

1259
00:46:04.411 --> 00:46:05.520
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>

1260
00:46:05.521 --> 00:46:06.840
<v Speaker 3>there's the core and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaff.</v>

1261
00:46:06.841 --> 00:46:10.770
<v Speaker 3>They've built this kind of large chaff </v>
<v Speaker 3>sphere around themselves.</v>

1262
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:11.933
<v Speaker 3>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think tasks we have is to try and </v>

1263
00:46:14.851 --> 00:46:16.080
<v Speaker 3>separate the core from the chaff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1264
00:46:16.081 --> 00:46:16.950
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1265
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.510
<v Speaker 3>all you people who are anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment,</v>

1266
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.100
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm antiestablishment too.</v>

1267
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:22.440
<v Speaker 3>I think Mitch Mcconnell is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was not a fan of Paul Ryan,</v>

1268
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.630
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the same thing as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>alt right.</v>

1269
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:25.763
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm fearful of is the </v>

1270
00:46:27.871 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 3>winks and nods to the actual outright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think when I say winks and nods,</v>

1271
00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:32.970
<v Speaker 3>and I've been saying this for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when,</v>

1272
00:46:32.971 --> 00:46:35.780
<v Speaker 3>when Donald Trump was on tv and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking about the KKK,</v>

1273
00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't Kkk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of them.</v>

1274
00:46:37.891 --> 00:46:39.390
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1275
00:46:39.391 --> 00:46:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Like we all know that you've heard of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the KKK.</v>

1276
00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:41.943
<v Speaker 3>We all know you've heard of David Duke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're your microphone didn't </v>

1277
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:44.370
<v Speaker 3>malfunction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were,</v>

1278
00:46:44.371 --> 00:46:45.204
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was two days before the Louisiana </v>

1279
00:46:46.861 --> 00:46:49.290
<v Speaker 3>primary and you didn't want to alienate </v>
<v Speaker 3>voters who thought you were going to win</v>

1280
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:50.280
<v Speaker 3>in the Louisiana primary.</v>

1281
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1282
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.830
<v Speaker 3>that's what was going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

1283
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.673
<v Speaker 3>that was a wink and a nod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when Donald Trump was retweeting </v>

1284
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.390
<v Speaker 3>white white nationalist accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1285
00:46:57.391 --> 00:46:58.224
<v Speaker 3>When he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's granting legitimacy to some </v>

1286
00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.400
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say fully outright figures,</v>

1287
00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:07.140
<v Speaker 3>but people who are very popular with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>alt right,</v>

1288
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:09.060
<v Speaker 3>the Alex Jones crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1289
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:09.953
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the kind of stuff where you're </v>

1290
00:47:10.921 --> 00:47:13.550
<v Speaker 3>getting into kind of a gray area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1291
00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:17.000
<v Speaker 3>but the do I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're an upward moe,</v>

1292
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:18.360
<v Speaker 3>an upwardly mobile threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1293
00:47:18.361 --> 00:47:19.194
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think their philosophy is so </v>

1294
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.950
<v Speaker 3>repugnant that most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of people think that's</v>

1295
00:47:22.951 --> 00:47:23.784
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's easy to sucker people </v>

1296
00:47:24.871 --> 00:47:25.704
<v Speaker 3>into thinking they're all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the game there is you sucker people </v>

1297
00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 3>into thinking they're all right and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>like me attack the outright,</v>

1298
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.091
<v Speaker 3>then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1299
00:47:31.091 --> 00:47:33.430
<v Speaker 3>he must be attacking me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm not attacking you.</v>

1300
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:33.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1301
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 3>So you post a puppy meme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1302
00:47:35.201 --> 00:47:36.340
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think you're stupid,</v>

1303
00:47:36.341 --> 00:47:38.260
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think you're all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1304
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:40.870
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as I said before on your show,</v>

1305
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:41.704
<v Speaker 3>and I got a lot of flack for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you tweet at me something that's </v>

1306
00:47:43.601 --> 00:47:44.434
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from David Duke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not my responsibility to determine </v>

1307
00:47:47.021 --> 00:47:48.520
<v Speaker 3>your motive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a tweet.</v>

1308
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:49.383
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to treat that the same way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I would treat treated tweet from </v>

1309
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:51.364
<v Speaker 3>David Duke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an idiotic tweet from an idiotic </v>

1310
00:47:52.841 --> 00:47:53.810
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how much</v>

1311
00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.450
<v Speaker 2>then is just related to the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture in general?</v>

1312
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Because so when I saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it spencer in DC?</v>

1313
00:47:59.381 --> 00:48:00.214
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1314
00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1315
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:04.780
<v Speaker 2>So I've had a family members on both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>

1316
00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:06.730
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's side and my mom's side die in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Holocaust.</v>

1317
00:48:06.731 --> 00:48:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I suspect you probably did as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1318
00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.520
<v Speaker 2>so I don't take kindly to that in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1319
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

1320
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather not see neo Nazis and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

1321
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:18.243
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that and my thought was these are </v>

1322
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 2>200 losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately we've now,</v>

1323
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:27.880
<v Speaker 2>the media will now run this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be on CNN all day long.</v>

1324
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Everyone will keep talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about and talking about people.</v>

1325
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Tell me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>

1326
00:48:31.811 --> 00:48:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Talk about it more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1327
00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:33.784
<v Speaker 2>And it's like all we're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflating this thing that these people </v>

1328
00:48:37.091 --> 00:48:39.820
<v Speaker 2>have always existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hate is always going to exist.</v>

1329
00:48:39.821 --> 00:48:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I can't make every person Niagara eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people,</v>

1330
00:48:42.851 --> 00:48:45.970
<v Speaker 2>I can't make every person not a juice or</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people or whatever it is.</v>

1331
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's human nature.</v>

1332
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:49.030
<v Speaker 2>You may not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's human nature.</v>

1333
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're inflating this stuff.</v>

1334
00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1335
00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:52.573
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've argued against sort of the </v>

1336
00:48:54.571 --> 00:48:55.980
<v Speaker 3>inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by the same token,</v>

1337
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.053
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's been empowerment of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fellow travelers and people who the </v>

1338
00:48:59.041 --> 00:49:03.230
<v Speaker 3>outright sees a sort of ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>forebears people like Pat Buchanan and I</v>

1339
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.073
<v Speaker 3>mentioned Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones probably isn't technically </v>

1340
00:49:05.341 --> 00:49:06.950
<v Speaker 3>all right or wouldn't consider himself </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts,</v>

1341
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:08.790
<v Speaker 3>but when he talks about Jewish influence</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the media,</v>

1342
00:49:08.791 --> 00:49:09.624
<v Speaker 3>in his rand's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's obviously granting them a lot of </v>

1343
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:12.173
<v Speaker 3>kind of credibility and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's giving them some ammunition to </v>

1344
00:49:15.901 --> 00:49:18.810
<v Speaker 3>feel like they have a allies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of people who seem to be</v>

1345
00:49:18.811 --> 00:49:19.644
<v Speaker 3>okay with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with benefiting from the shit posters </v>

1346
00:49:21.631 --> 00:49:22.860
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the alt right groups.</v>

1347
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they can gain traffic.</v>

1348
00:49:24.451 --> 00:49:25.830
<v Speaker 3>That was my main critical Breitbart by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>

1349
00:49:25.831 --> 00:49:26.664
<v Speaker 3>Like when I said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Steve Bannon was appealing to the </v>

1350
00:49:27.961 --> 00:49:28.290
<v Speaker 3>alt right.</v>

1351
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:29.123
<v Speaker 3>That's because he called himself the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Plat Breitbart a platform for the alt </v>

1352
00:49:31.491 --> 00:49:33.540
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea was that he was,</v>

1353
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:34.493
<v Speaker 3>and this is always been my critique of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve and the left doesn't understand </v>

1354
00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.550
<v Speaker 3>anything remotely approaching </v>
<v Speaker 3>moderation.</v>

1355
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:39.563
<v Speaker 3>So my critique of Steven Breitbart was </v>
<v Speaker 3>always that what had happened was that </v>

1356
00:49:43.021 --> 00:49:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Breitbart had been moved and direction </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were willing to pander to some</v>

1357
00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:47.274
<v Speaker 3>of the worst people on Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My posting material that appealed to </v>

1358
00:49:48.961 --> 00:49:50.240
<v Speaker 3>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1359
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.400
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that demonstrates to me a tremendous</v>

1360
00:49:53.401 --> 00:49:54.234
<v Speaker 3>will for power from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Steve and a willingness to work </v>

1361
00:49:56.791 --> 00:49:58.950
<v Speaker 3>with anyone to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's my main critique.</v>

1362
00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.690
<v Speaker 3>And the left immediately sees done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1363
00:50:00.691 --> 00:50:02.310
<v Speaker 3>well he must be an antisemite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be a racist.</v>

1364
00:50:02.311 --> 00:50:03.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1365
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.471
<v Speaker 3>that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1366
00:50:04.471 --> 00:50:05.304
<v Speaker 3>he's an opportunist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've gone out of your way to say that </v>

1367
00:50:06.751 --> 00:50:08.040
<v Speaker 3>you don't think he's in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

1368
00:50:08.041 --> 00:50:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any evidence at all.</v>

1369
00:50:09.121 --> 00:50:10.250
<v Speaker 3>But Steve's an antisemite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1370
00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:11.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Steve's an asshole.</v>

1371
00:50:11.731 --> 00:50:13.010
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think she's an asset to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1372
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you make of that then?</v>

1373
00:50:15.471 --> 00:50:18.950
<v Speaker 2>So you worked with the guy who worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was technically your boss,</v>

1374
00:50:18.951 --> 00:50:19.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

1375
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:20.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's chairman of the company.</v>

1376
00:50:20.541 --> 00:50:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was technically your boss.</v>

1377
00:50:22.191 --> 00:50:24.110
<v Speaker 2>You have no evidence that he's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemite,</v>

1378
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:25.580
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You as the,</v>

1379
00:50:25.581 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 2>as the Adl said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were the number attack,</v>

1380
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:32.450
<v Speaker 2>a recipient of antisemetic abuse online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are aware of the idea of it.</v>

1381
00:50:32.451 --> 00:50:33.284
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

1382
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.563
<v Speaker 3>And I will say it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people who probably will get </v>

1383
00:50:35.561 --> 00:50:36.790
<v Speaker 3>this following.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1384
00:50:36.791 --> 00:50:37.624
<v Speaker 3>when Milo was banned from twitter at my </v>
<v Speaker 3>Auntie's medic feed went down 70% </v>

1385
00:50:40.151 --> 00:50:41.800
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1386
00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1387
00:50:43.241 --> 00:50:44.950
<v Speaker 3>but see the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know where those his,</v>

1388
00:50:44.951 --> 00:50:45.784
<v Speaker 3>where those actual antisemites or shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>posters in all likelihood they're shit </v>

1389
00:50:47.741 --> 00:50:48.250
<v Speaker 3>posters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1390
00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:49.083
<v Speaker 3>I would guess that 90% of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what you are doing is you're </v>

1391
00:50:51.851 --> 00:50:54.280
<v Speaker 3>mainstreaming the idea that this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric is okay.</v>

1392
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Because in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was always my critique of,</v>

1393
00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.033
<v Speaker 3>of sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the notion that it's the same thing to </v>

1394
00:50:59.051 --> 00:51:01.630
<v Speaker 3>be politically incorrect as it is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just be a bad person.</v>

1395
00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if it like political,</v>

1396
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:04.813
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole point of fighting political </v>

1397
00:51:05.261 --> 00:51:06.094
<v Speaker 3>correctness is so you can say true </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in order to promulgate better </v>

1398
00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:09.400
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1399
00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:10.533
<v Speaker 3>you can then you're not doing it in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world any good by just shouting the n </v>

1400
00:51:12.821 --> 00:51:13.230
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

1401
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1402
00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Not doing me any good or the world any </v>
<v Speaker 3>good by just tweeting people pictures of</v>

1403
00:51:16.511 --> 00:51:17.610
<v Speaker 3>black kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you're a cock.</v>

1404
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1405
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.640
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1406
00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.473
<v Speaker 3>how is the world become a better place </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it has the dialogue become any </v>

1407
00:51:21.521 --> 00:51:23.410
<v Speaker 3>better because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You certainly have the right to do it.</v>

1408
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm not arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have the right to do it.</v>

1409
00:51:24.761 --> 00:51:25.594
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you also have the right slap </v>

1410
00:51:26.411 --> 00:51:28.060
<v Speaker 3>yourself in the face of the frying pan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1411
00:51:28.061 --> 00:51:28.894
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the right to do lots of stupid </v>

1412
00:51:29.981 --> 00:51:30.460
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1413
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.293
<v Speaker 3>The question is there are people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't making the affirmative case that </v>

1414
00:51:32.921 --> 00:51:33.754
<v Speaker 3>this is making the country a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>place and making the dialogue more open </v>

1415
00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:36.933
<v Speaker 3>when in reality what you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is you're breeding the resistance </v>

1416
00:51:39.161 --> 00:51:40.210
<v Speaker 3>to the dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1417
00:51:40.211 --> 00:51:40.720
<v Speaker 3>because then,</v>

1418
00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:41.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1419
00:51:41.611 --> 00:51:42.444
<v Speaker 2>I guess what those people would argue is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the system has become so rigid and </v>

1420
00:51:45.571 --> 00:51:48.770
<v Speaker 2>so afraid of everything and every idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the only way you,</v>

1421
00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:49.683
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my actually said this to me on </v>

1422
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:51.623
<v Speaker 2>my show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a year before the election </v>

1423
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:56.360
<v Speaker 2>that this was the only way we were going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to break any of this,</v>

1424
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:57.850
<v Speaker 3>but even Milo knows he's lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1425
00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Next one mile is on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ask Him one question if he thinks that's</v>

1426
00:52:00.461 --> 00:52:01.870
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask him to say the n word on your show.</v>

1427
00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.690
<v Speaker 3>That's the most rigid taboo in American </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

1428
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:05.703
<v Speaker 3>Asked me to say the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he really believes that all taboos </v>

1429
00:52:06.881 --> 00:52:10.330
<v Speaker 3>oughta be broken because taboos are </v>
<v Speaker 3>worthy of being broken,</v>

1430
00:52:10.331 --> 00:52:11.440
<v Speaker 3>and then we have to break down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

1431
00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Ask Him if he has the ball sitting on </v>
<v Speaker 3>word on your show.</v>

1432
00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I will do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you,</v>

1433
00:52:15.221 --> 00:52:15.971
<v Speaker 2>he says no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1434
00:52:15.971 --> 00:52:16.804
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to guess that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve the entire alt right thing right </v>

1435
00:52:19.181 --> 00:52:20.014
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think something we can possibly </v>

1436
00:52:21.401 --> 00:52:22.234
<v Speaker 2>solve is the media question related to </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this because mainstream media is </v>

1437
00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:28.540
<v Speaker 2>absolutely crumbling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows it.</v>

1438
00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:29.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was on with you on election </v>

1439
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.860
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I kept saying was we've watched the</v>

1440
00:52:32.861 --> 00:52:36.670
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media slowly crumble as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>online media has risen,</v>

1441
00:52:36.671 --> 00:52:37.504
<v Speaker 2>and I think as of the election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually starting to tilt and now </v>

1442
00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.213
<v Speaker 2>the online guys are kind of winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why you're seeing all this </v>

1443
00:52:43.571 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 2>stuff about fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to say that,</v>

1444
00:52:45.261 --> 00:52:47.410
<v Speaker 2>and some people online are a bushing out</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake news.</v>

1445
00:52:47.411 --> 00:52:48.244
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>

1446
00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.280
<v Speaker 2>but what do you think first of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the meme of fake news,</v>

1447
00:52:51.281 --> 00:52:52.114
<v Speaker 2>it seems pretty obvious to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I don't know who the full </v>

1448
00:52:54.491 --> 00:52:55.324
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone in power is pushing out </v>

1449
00:52:58.301 --> 00:53:00.010
<v Speaker 2>this idea because they lost control.</v>

1450
00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:00.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1451
00:53:00.381 --> 00:53:01.214
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a conspiracy so much </v>

1452
00:53:01.661 --> 00:53:03.640
<v Speaker 3>as somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one story that comes out,</v>

1453
00:53:03.641 --> 00:53:04.474
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fake news and everybody sees is on </v>

1454
00:53:05.231 --> 00:53:05.471
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1455
00:53:05.471 --> 00:53:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Which is usually how I like being in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right way.</v>

1456
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Media works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1457
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:09.521
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1458
00:53:09.521 --> 00:53:10.450
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1459
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sharks grom like it's,</v>

1460
00:53:12.201 --> 00:53:12.660
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1461
00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.290
<v Speaker 3>the term is in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the sharks come.</v>

1462
00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:15.670
<v Speaker 3>So somebody says fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

1463
00:53:15.671 --> 00:53:16.504
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a great excuse for why Hillary </v>

1464
00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Clinton lost because everybody believed </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these fake things right now</v>

1465
00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:22.220
<v Speaker 2>mirasee of basically lazy.</v>

1466
00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:23.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1467
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.870
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

1468
00:53:24.871 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 3>And think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>

1469
00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:27.613
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not to say there isn't such a </v>

1470
00:53:28.141 --> 00:53:29.190
<v Speaker 3>thing as fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>

1471
00:53:29.191 --> 00:53:30.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of stupid headlines that</v>

1472
00:53:30.561 --> 00:53:33.650
<v Speaker 3>glow around that are not true and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we spend time to banking,</v>

1473
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:35.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the right and from the left,</v>

1474
00:53:35.371 --> 00:53:38.250
<v Speaker 3>things that things that are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>patently false.</v>

1475
00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1476
00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:43.620
<v Speaker 3>and trump himself was a rather large </v>
<v Speaker 3>promulgator of things that were false.</v>

1477
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.290
<v Speaker 3>And it was important to try and debunk </v>
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>

1478
00:53:46.291 --> 00:53:47.124
<v Speaker 3>But the media had so shredded a total </v>
<v Speaker 3>credibility that it couldn't fairly </v>

1479
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:49.944
<v Speaker 3>debunk any of this stuff because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were saying things that were false were </v>

1480
00:53:51.991 --> 00:53:52.824
<v Speaker 3>true for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then along comes trump and he </v>

1481
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:55.853
<v Speaker 3>basically runs a post truth campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have two candidates running </v>

1482
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:58.284
<v Speaker 3>post-truth campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the media insisting that only one is </v>

1483
00:53:59.911 --> 00:54:01.140
<v Speaker 3>running a post truth campaign.</v>

1484
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.850
<v Speaker 3>And then everybody going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>

1485
00:54:02.851 --> 00:54:03.684
<v Speaker 3>like you don't get to be the arbiters of</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth because you blew all your </v>

1486
00:54:05.371 --> 00:54:07.530
<v Speaker 3>credibility a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1487
00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:09.480
<v Speaker 3>the problem is that now no one's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>arbiter for truth.</v>

1488
00:54:09.481 --> 00:54:10.590
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1489
00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 3>the media certainly wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm glad to see them come down.</v>

1490
00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:13.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I would like to see take its place </v>

1491
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:15.923
<v Speaker 3>is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's honestly analyze what's true </v>

1492
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:20.130
<v Speaker 3>and what's not true as opposed to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>serves our interests in what,</v>

1493
00:54:20.131 --> 00:54:20.964
<v Speaker 3>what doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So The Washington Post called me </v>

1494
00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:22.524
<v Speaker 3>recently and they asked if you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to determine whether a news source is </v>

1495
00:54:25.111 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 3>credible or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are sort of some quick keys.</v>

1496
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:27.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1497
00:54:27.991 --> 00:54:28.824
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the easiest thing is are they open with </v>

1498
00:54:30.841 --> 00:54:33.690
<v Speaker 3>their bias and do they run stories that </v>
<v Speaker 3>counter their bias,</v>

1499
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:34.591
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If their,</v>

1500
00:54:34.591 --> 00:54:37.950
<v Speaker 3>if their news outlet and they only run </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftwing stories and there are left wing</v>

1501
00:54:37.951 --> 00:54:39.180
<v Speaker 3>sites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they only run leftwing stories.</v>

1502
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.700
<v Speaker 3>They never run a story that counters </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that they say,</v>

1503
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:42.923
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should what you should double check </v>

1504
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:45.173
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're probably just a propaganda </v>

1505
00:54:46.771 --> 00:54:47.820
<v Speaker 3>outlet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they're a site,</v>

1506
00:54:47.821 --> 00:54:49.980
<v Speaker 3>like I think the Washington Post </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually better than New York Times this</v>

1507
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:50.814
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The New York Times is entirely one </v>

1508
00:54:52.051 --> 00:54:53.810
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Washington Post not,</v>

1509
00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:55.020
<v Speaker 3>not talking bout their opinion </v>
<v Speaker 3>columnists.</v>

1510
00:54:55.021 --> 00:54:56.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about the news that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>break.</v>

1511
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:57.543
<v Speaker 3>Like the Washington Post is actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking some anti Hillary News in the </v>

1512
00:54:59.011 --> 00:54:59.770
<v Speaker 3>past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1513
00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:01.830
<v Speaker 3>in the last three weeks before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>election cycle.</v>

1514
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1515
00:55:02.971 --> 00:55:04.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to distinguish </v>
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>

1516
00:55:04.411 --> 00:55:06.150
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1517
00:55:06.151 --> 00:55:08.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean when there's no gatekeeper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the good news is there is no gatekeeper.</v>

1518
00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.760
<v Speaker 3>The bad news is there's no gatekeeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1519
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:12.223
<v Speaker 3>It's not a full,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a fully great thing because </v>

1520
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:15.203
<v Speaker 3>nothing has emerged yet that act as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and it maybe that's just because </v>

1521
00:55:19.501 --> 00:55:21.960
<v Speaker 3>we're demanding more of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people have to demand more of it.</v>

1522
00:55:21.961 --> 00:55:23.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying there should be somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>who like,</v>

1523
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:24.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the gatekeeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not there.</v>

1524
00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 3>No one is the gatekeeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I my own gatekeeper.</v>

1525
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.103
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I analyze the news for myself and I </v>

1526
00:55:29.341 --> 00:55:31.440
<v Speaker 3>don't just believe every headline that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>see on facebook.</v>

1527
00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:32.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that that I do think is a concern </v>

1528
00:55:33.421 --> 00:55:34.950
<v Speaker 3>because that's going to polarize the </v>
<v Speaker 3>news.</v>

1529
00:55:34.951 --> 00:55:37.110
<v Speaker 3>If you're just picking the headlines </v>
<v Speaker 3>that reinforce your bias.</v>

1530
00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're in,</v>

1531
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.353
<v Speaker 3>you're not likely to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to achieve anything remotely resembling </v>

1532
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:41.740
<v Speaker 3>the truth.</v>

1533
00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:42.573
<v Speaker 2>And it almost seems obvious that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we were going to end up because </v>

1534
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:46.270
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what everyone does on twitter.</v>

1535
00:55:46.271 --> 00:55:49.450
<v Speaker 2>You cater things to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try not to do that,</v>

1536
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:50.583
<v Speaker 2>but every now and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something gets to me to the point where </v>

1537
00:55:52.011 --> 00:55:54.820
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot follow this buzzfeed,</v>

1538
00:55:54.821 --> 00:55:55.840
<v Speaker 2>my final Straw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1539
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:59.050
<v Speaker 2>I unfollowed them already before that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gains thing.</v>

1540
00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:00.041
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1541
00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:02.080
<v Speaker 2>that's why I am followed this drivel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1542
00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:04.030
<v Speaker 2>but even that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a risk in that.</v>

1543
00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By slowly just filtering everything into</v>

1544
00:56:07.601 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 2>your own little ideology that</v>

1545
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.240
<v Speaker 3>the best indicator is if somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 3>hated by both sides,</v>

1546
00:56:11.241 --> 00:56:13.670
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty good indicator that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're at least baseline honest.</v>

1547
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1548
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:15.141
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1549
00:56:15.141 --> 00:56:17.060
<v Speaker 3>that's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a level of honesty.</v>

1550
00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:18.920
<v Speaker 3>And what I mean by that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not,</v>

1551
00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:21.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are obviously conspiratorial,</v>

1552
00:56:21.021 --> 00:56:21.854
<v Speaker 3>but people who are flack from every side</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't please one side all </v>

1553
00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:27.370
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1554
00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not a foolproof test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1555
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.900
<v Speaker 3>it's an okay test for people who tend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be more honest.</v>

1556
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:37.510
<v Speaker 3>So you exist sort of in both worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you consider yourself a more,</v>

1557
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 3>more mainstream than no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of straddle it.</v>

1558
00:56:40.691 --> 00:56:41.524
<v Speaker 3>But because you're on Fox a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on CNN a lot me on that often </v>

1559
00:56:44.951 --> 00:56:46.930
<v Speaker 3>that because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>

1560
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:48.850
<v Speaker 3>I have the troublesome quality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If not,</v>

1561
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:49.750
<v Speaker 3>they don't know not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna say.</v>

1562
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.130
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit of a problem.</v>

1563
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little.</v>

1564
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.470
<v Speaker 3>They'll have me on like I'm on a Fox </v>
<v Speaker 3>News once every three weeks maybe,</v>

1565
00:56:56.471 --> 00:56:57.304
<v Speaker 3>and I'm on CNN once a month perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not like a regular guest on any </v>

1566
00:57:00.701 --> 00:57:01.534
<v Speaker 3>of these places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they continue to crumble and if </v>

1567
00:57:03.821 --> 00:57:04.654
<v Speaker 3>the online thing grows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as you're saying when there's no </v>

1568
00:57:06.131 --> 00:57:07.270
<v Speaker 3>gatekeeper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone's in,</v>

1569
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:10.000
<v Speaker 3>and this is a problem now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1570
00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 3>As you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be on us,</v>

1571
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.400
<v Speaker 3>it can be on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should have us individually,</v>

1572
00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.070
<v Speaker 3>but most people don't have that real </v>
<v Speaker 3>risk there too.</v>

1573
00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:17.560
<v Speaker 3>People are lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1574
00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:18.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

1575
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:22.480
<v Speaker 3>and so that laziness is going to apply </v>
<v Speaker 3>except there's not even a shred of,</v>

1576
00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:23.314
<v Speaker 3>of gatekeeping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that the problem with a lot of the </v>

1577
00:57:24.881 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 3>news that the problem with the fake news</v>
<v Speaker 3>critique is that it's encompassing a lot</v>

1578
00:57:28.961 --> 00:57:29.980
<v Speaker 3>of angles on the news.</v>

1579
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.870
<v Speaker 3>So it's not that the news itself is </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

1580
00:57:31.871 --> 00:57:32.704
<v Speaker 3>it's angles on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like how politifact does their </v>

1581
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:35.230
<v Speaker 3>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So politifact,</v>

1582
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.840
<v Speaker 3>we'll say about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitt Romney will say this,</v>

1583
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.310
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this happened during the campaign.</v>

1584
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton said something about she</v>
<v Speaker 3>liked open borders.</v>

1585
00:57:42.491 --> 00:57:43.324
<v Speaker 3>Trump goes on stage and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton says she likes open </v>

1586
00:57:45.011 --> 00:57:45.844
<v Speaker 3>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Politifact analyzes it and gives it a </v>

1587
00:57:46.661 --> 00:57:47.940
<v Speaker 3>half true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1588
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:49.720
<v Speaker 3>And he's just repeating exactly what she</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1589
00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:50.593
<v Speaker 3>but say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet his implication was that she was </v>

1590
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:52.601
<v Speaker 3>saying x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>y,</v>

1591
00:57:52.601 --> 00:57:53.410
<v Speaker 3>and Z.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1592
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:56.170
<v Speaker 3>well now that's your calling his stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake news,</v>

1593
00:57:56.171 --> 00:57:57.004
<v Speaker 3>but you're the actual fake news because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're reading implications that you're </v>

1594
00:57:59.111 --> 00:58:00.490
<v Speaker 3>reading into him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1595
00:58:00.491 --> 00:58:02.170
<v Speaker 3>once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you get into reading other people's</v>

1596
00:58:02.171 --> 00:58:03.370
<v Speaker 3>implications,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1597
00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:05.380
<v Speaker 3>you ended up in some pretty dicey </v>
<v Speaker 3>territory.</v>

1598
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:08.140
<v Speaker 3>But it used to be that when there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual fake news,</v>

1599
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:09.090
<v Speaker 3>people lost their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1600
00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:09.943
<v Speaker 3>Like Jason Blair promulgated Fake News </v>
<v Speaker 3>and lost his job at a publication that </v>

1601
00:58:13.091 --> 00:58:15.260
<v Speaker 3>we on the right hate the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1602
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.113
<v Speaker 3>but that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference between that and </v>

1603
00:58:18.101 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 3>the angle on the news is wrong or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts of the story,</v>

1604
00:58:21.251 --> 00:58:22.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the angle is wrong.</v>

1605
00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.790
<v Speaker 3>That's not fake news that you don't like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the angle on the story.</v>

1606
00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1607
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.890
<v Speaker 3>but the left and the right trade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should recognize this.</v>

1608
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:28.743
<v Speaker 3>Not everything that comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington Post or New York Times is </v>

1609
00:58:30.551 --> 00:58:31.384
<v Speaker 3>false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It may just be that the angle that </v>

1610
00:58:32.531 --> 00:58:36.010
<v Speaker 3>they're giving you is an angle that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like or an angle that that doesn't</v>

1611
00:58:36.011 --> 00:58:38.290
<v Speaker 3>reflect underlying truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been out of the facts of the story,</v>

1612
00:58:38.291 --> 00:58:38.921
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1613
00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:39.760
<v Speaker 3>The facts of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1614
00:58:39.761 --> 00:58:41.860
<v Speaker 3>So when the New York Times reports </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

1615
00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:43.053
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1616
00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:46.370
<v Speaker 3>when the New York Times reports a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1617
00:58:46.371 --> 00:58:47.890
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they'd reported,</v>

1618
00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:48.873
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hands up don't shoot thing just </v>

1619
00:58:49.391 --> 00:58:49.990
<v Speaker 3>straight.</v>

1620
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:51.160
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fake news.</v>

1621
00:58:51.161 --> 00:58:54.760
<v Speaker 3>If they report that a black guy was </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed by a white officer in Ferguson,</v>

1622
00:58:54.761 --> 00:58:55.594
<v Speaker 3>Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they went with proceeds to </v>

1623
00:58:56.651 --> 00:58:59.020
<v Speaker 3>report it as though it's a serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem all across the country.</v>

1624
00:58:59.110 --> 00:59:00.820
<v Speaker 3>The fake news part of that is their </v>
<v Speaker 3>angle.</v>

1625
00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:03.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not that a black guy was shot by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the white guy,</v>

1626
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:03.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1627
00:59:03.721 --> 00:59:04.780
<v Speaker 3>in Ferguson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Missouri.</v>

1628
00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:05.883
<v Speaker 3>And what I've seen is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing the baby out with the bath </v>

1629
00:59:07.111 --> 00:59:07.944
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it turns out you can't believe </v>

1630
00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:11.260
<v Speaker 3>anything in the media says right now you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't believe their angle.</v>

1631
00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:12.183
<v Speaker 3>You can't believe anything they say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they say Donald Trump hasn't </v>

1632
00:59:14.291 --> 00:59:17.050
<v Speaker 3>turned over his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his irs reports,</v>

1633
00:59:17.051 --> 00:59:18.640
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't turned over his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his tax returns.</v>

1634
00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:19.653
<v Speaker 3>There's a tendency for people to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fake news is we know that that's </v>

1635
00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 3>not fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1636
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.440
<v Speaker 3>You might not think it matters.</v>

1637
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 3>You may have 10 excuses why it's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not fake news per se.</v>

1638
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.473
<v Speaker 3>When everybody just called stuff they </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with fake news and it's </v>

1639
00:59:30.861 --> 00:59:31.694
<v Speaker 3>happening now again on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never felt simultaneously less </v>

1640
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:38.300
<v Speaker 3>bipartisan and more bipartisan about </v>
<v Speaker 3>life than I have in the recent past.</v>

1641
00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:39.593
<v Speaker 3>And then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where I think opportunities </v>

1642
00:59:40.641 --> 00:59:42.860
<v Speaker 3>because there's so much being reset </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

1643
00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:43.853
<v Speaker 3>W what do you think about the risk of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not coming from the government in </v>

1644
00:59:47.061 --> 00:59:48.650
<v Speaker 3>some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>censorship right now,</v>

1645
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:49.543
<v Speaker 3>but we know what's happened with prager </v>
<v Speaker 3>u videos where they've put hard </v>

1646
00:59:53.061 --> 00:59:54.740
<v Speaker 3>restricted lists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had,</v>

1647
00:59:54.741 --> 00:59:56.900
<v Speaker 3>I did an interview with John Mccain who </v>
<v Speaker 3>is on,</v>

1648
00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:01.460
<v Speaker 3>who was on cable news every single day </v>
<v Speaker 3>to decided to demonetize it.</v>

1649
01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:02.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1650
01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I did my interview with Ion Hursey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I leave 80 monetized.</v>

1651
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:07.310
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have all kinds of stories now.</v>

1652
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:10.400
<v Speaker 3>If things getting hurt and algorithms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even my low being banned,</v>

1653
01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:10.940
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1654
01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Twitter can do what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1655
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:17.180
<v Speaker 3>So all of this stuff is starting to add </v>
<v Speaker 3>up to something,</v>

1656
01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:18.014
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something cracking down on </v>

1657
01:00:20.091 --> 01:00:22.340
<v Speaker 3>this new wild west out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1658
01:00:22.341 --> 01:00:24.200
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that you've seen,</v>

1659
01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:25.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter pay for some of that and in </v>

1660
01:00:26.241 --> 01:00:27.074
<v Speaker 3>market share,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be incumbent on people on </v>

1661
01:00:29.691 --> 01:00:31.640
<v Speaker 3>the right to build an alternative </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure to these things.</v>

1662
01:00:31.641 --> 01:00:32.474
<v Speaker 3>And that's very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people on the right don't tend to </v>

1663
01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:35.384
<v Speaker 3>think in terms of media too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we invest a lot of money and </v>

1664
01:00:37.821 --> 01:00:39.630
<v Speaker 3>politicians and we invest a lot of money</v>
<v Speaker 3>and think tanks,</v>

1665
01:00:39.631 --> 01:00:41.000
<v Speaker 3>but we don't invest all that much money </v>
<v Speaker 3>in media.</v>

1666
01:00:41.001 --> 01:00:43.070
<v Speaker 3>There are a few kinds of people who will</v>
<v Speaker 3>invest money in media,</v>

1667
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:44.263
<v Speaker 3>but the number of like we gave $100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million to somebody to start a business </v>

1668
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.343
<v Speaker 3>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll see a lot of people who spend </v>

1669
01:00:49.131 --> 01:00:50.900
<v Speaker 3>like five to $10 million to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1670
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:51.793
<v Speaker 3>but to start an actual twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that that requires enormous </v>

1671
01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.610
<v Speaker 3>expenditures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the capital.</v>

1672
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.733
<v Speaker 3>And most people on the right don't see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that as a winning business proposition </v>

1673
01:00:59.901 --> 01:01:02.900
<v Speaker 3>because people on the right tend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think in terms of Roi and twitter hasn't</v>

1674
01:01:02.901 --> 01:01:04.130
<v Speaker 3>even seen an Roi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1675
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:07.030
<v Speaker 3>Whatever twitter is losing money still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1676
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.010
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also it's,</v>

1677
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.730
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to go up against the behemoths</v>
<v Speaker 3>like youtube,</v>

1678
01:01:10.731 --> 01:01:11.564
<v Speaker 3>like there've been some attempts to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>up against against youtube before there </v>

1679
01:01:13.491 --> 01:01:15.500
<v Speaker 3>is a conservative attempt to go up </v>
<v Speaker 3>against youtube.</v>

1680
01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:18.650
<v Speaker 3>It didn't do particularly well because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is that it was billed as the</v>

1681
01:01:18.651 --> 01:01:20.540
<v Speaker 3>conservative attempt to go up against </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube.</v>

1682
01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:24.200
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't built as open to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you sort of have to,</v>

1683
01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:27.380
<v Speaker 3>to do the open to everybody routine in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to really succeed.</v>

1684
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:29.090
<v Speaker 3>But you're at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you artist systemic disadvantage.</v>

1685
01:01:29.091 --> 01:01:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Youtube has existed for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for forever.</v>

1686
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.833
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube is just what the New York Times </v>

1687
01:01:35.361 --> 01:01:36.860
<v Speaker 3>was 30 years ago.</v>

1688
01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.950
<v Speaker 3>The only thing in the space as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as things progressed,</v>

1689
01:01:39.951 --> 01:01:43.040
<v Speaker 3>I think that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the truth is that youtube is just</v>

1690
01:01:43.041 --> 01:01:47.450
<v Speaker 3>a search service with a lot of big w </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a lot of servers that provide space</v>

1691
01:01:47.451 --> 01:01:49.280
<v Speaker 3>for the videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>

1692
01:01:49.281 --> 01:01:50.114
<v Speaker 3>I'm old enough to remember when ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>jeeves was a threat and then Google </v>

1693
01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So or hotmail,</v>

1694
01:01:55.551 --> 01:01:58.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean like all the prodigy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably before your time.</v>

1695
01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1696
01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:00.063
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things look insurmountable at </v>

1697
01:02:02.331 --> 01:02:04.430
<v Speaker 3>the time and then over time the market </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroys them,</v>

1698
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:05.383
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aol was the big thing and now nobody </v>

1699
01:02:06.741 --> 01:02:07.574
<v Speaker 3>uses say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>

1700
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:08.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1701
01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:09.613
<v Speaker 3>this show is on one of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our main method of distribution is </v>

1702
01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:14.090
<v Speaker 3>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want youtube to work,</v>

1703
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:16.620
<v Speaker 3>I want to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

1704
01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:18.620
<v Speaker 3>and I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1705
01:02:18.621 --> 01:02:19.920
<v Speaker 3>it's a very interesting debate.</v>

1706
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.753
<v Speaker 3>I will say it's an interesting debate </v>
<v Speaker 3>when people look at private companies </v>

1707
01:02:22.771 --> 01:02:23.730
<v Speaker 3>like youtube and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1708
01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:25.710
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't ban anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1709
01:02:25.711 --> 01:02:26.544
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make the argument that youtube </v>

1710
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:30.540
<v Speaker 3>should ban certain things like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a graphic terrorist video,</v>

1711
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:31.490
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should it,</v>

1712
01:02:31.491 --> 01:02:33.450
<v Speaker 3>do they have the right to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now for me,</v>

1713
01:02:33.451 --> 01:02:35.640
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather err on the side of everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes up,</v>

1714
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.940
<v Speaker 3>then think and then certain things come </v>
<v Speaker 3>down because I don't really trust people</v>

1715
01:02:38.941 --> 01:02:42.030
<v Speaker 3>in charge of anything to to to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why I'm more libertarian,</v>

1716
01:02:42.031 --> 01:02:43.680
<v Speaker 3>even when it comes to things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube,</v>

1717
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 3>but I see the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not all,</v>

1718
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:48.030
<v Speaker 3>not all forms of speech are created </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly equal,</v>

1719
01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:50.520
<v Speaker 3>at least in their merit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are in there in terms of your right</v>

1720
01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:51.354
<v Speaker 3>to say them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not necessarily in terms of </v>

1721
01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:53.940
<v Speaker 3>merit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're in the private sector,</v>

1722
01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:55.950
<v Speaker 3>you're speaking about merit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not just trying to speak in terms</v>

1723
01:02:55.951 --> 01:02:56.690
<v Speaker 3>of right to say.</v>

1724
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:57.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there could be a first </v>

1725
01:02:59.271 --> 01:03:01.330
<v Speaker 2>amendment issue related to all this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I get it.</v>

1726
01:03:01.331 --> 01:03:01.550
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

1727
01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:02.383
<v Speaker 3>governor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people try and make the utilities </v>

1728
01:03:03.011 --> 01:03:04.300
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a particularly good</v>

1729
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.810
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because to me it seems,</v>

1730
01:03:05.811 --> 01:03:08.960
<v Speaker 2>it seems maybe not fully because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what a public utility,</v>

1731
01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:11.330
<v Speaker 2>if there's something else going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not utilities.</v>

1732
01:03:11.331 --> 01:03:14.600
<v Speaker 2>But I would argue that the owners of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these companies,</v>

1733
01:03:14.601 --> 01:03:15.830
<v Speaker 2>the people on the board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1734
01:03:15.831 --> 01:03:16.664
<v Speaker 2>Jack Zuckerberg and all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are so intertwined with our </v>

1735
01:03:20.391 --> 01:03:22.150
<v Speaker 2>politicians right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1736
01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.053
<v Speaker 2>That now we actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's directly a first </v>

1737
01:03:25.791 --> 01:03:28.100
<v Speaker 2>amendment thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something there because it's</v>

1738
01:03:28.101 --> 01:03:29.200
<v Speaker 2>almost collusion with it.</v>

1739
01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.560
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1740
01:03:30.561 --> 01:03:31.394
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the solution to that is to downsize </v>

1741
01:03:32.451 --> 01:03:34.220
<v Speaker 3>the government radically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to,</v>

1742
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:35.360
<v Speaker 3>not to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1743
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:36.780
<v Speaker 3>our guy do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1744
01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:37.451
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it and that,</v>

1745
01:03:37.451 --> 01:03:38.284
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying.</v>

1746
01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:40.040
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm seeing generally is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1747
01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.440
<v Speaker 3>it's our guy doing it so it's okay now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1748
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:43.071
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1749
01:03:43.071 --> 01:03:45.070
<v Speaker 3>I think that that Zuckerberg working </v>
<v Speaker 3>closely,</v>

1750
01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:45.913
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zuckerberg wouldn't be working with the </v>

1751
01:03:47.511 --> 01:03:48.680
<v Speaker 3>government if the government were </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>

1752
01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we,</v>

1753
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:51.560
<v Speaker 3>we spend a lot of money on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

1754
01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:52.394
<v Speaker 3>we give money to political candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We spend all of our time talking about </v>

1755
01:03:55.191 --> 01:03:57.560
<v Speaker 3>trump or hillary because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government's powerful.</v>

1756
01:03:57.790 --> 01:04:02.790
<v Speaker 3>I think anybody spent tons of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking like in 1836 about,</v>

1757
01:04:02.991 --> 01:04:03.824
<v Speaker 3>about the national election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they spend some time talking </v>

1758
01:04:05.181 --> 01:04:06.014
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't dominant the way that it </v>

1759
01:04:06.621 --> 01:04:09.050
<v Speaker 3>is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that people were just,</v>

1760
01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.160
<v Speaker 3>they could be the most important </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision that I was.</v>

1761
01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:12.920
<v Speaker 3>People not dating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1762
01:04:12.921 --> 01:04:13.754
<v Speaker 3>Destroying their lives because if who </v>
<v Speaker 3>won the presidency when it was Franklin </v>

1763
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Pierce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1764
01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.700
<v Speaker 3>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody was doing that.</v>

1765
01:04:19.701 --> 01:04:20.534
<v Speaker 3>This is part of the reason is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>federal government just was not </v>

1766
01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.740
<v Speaker 3>particularly powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you care what some bureaucrat</v>

1767
01:04:24.741 --> 01:04:26.300
<v Speaker 3>in Washington DC is doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't affect you.</v>

1768
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:27.450
<v Speaker 2>So that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1769
01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:30.000
<v Speaker 2>I've said this a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me that's the best argument for small</v>

1770
01:04:30.001 --> 01:04:30.351
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1771
01:04:30.351 --> 01:04:31.184
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is if you don't like Hillary and </v>

1772
01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:35.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't like trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1773
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:38.650
<v Speaker 2>well then I should vote for more </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats or vote for more Republicans.</v>

1774
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:40.460
<v Speaker 2>These idiots out of our way.</v>

1775
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1776
01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:42.780
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the,</v>

1777
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:44.150
<v Speaker 3>I think the only smart thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the repair,</v>

1778
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:44.993
<v Speaker 3>he said in his presidential campaign in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2012 and you said you wanted to make </v>

1779
01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Washington dc insignificant in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1780
01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:49.471
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1781
01:04:49.471 --> 01:04:50.540
<v Speaker 3>that sounds great to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Because I said or anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1783
01:04:52.701 --> 01:04:53.580
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1784
01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:54.414
<v Speaker 3>I set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say this on college campuses all the </v>

1785
01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:57.690
<v Speaker 3>time on college campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids are constantly thinking,</v>

1786
01:04:57.691 --> 01:04:59.330
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many obstacles to what I want</v>

1787
01:04:59.331 --> 01:05:00.390
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see in politics now,</v>

1788
01:05:00.391 --> 01:05:02.160
<v Speaker 3>trump keeps saying there's an obstacle </v>
<v Speaker 3>to what you want to do,</v>

1789
01:05:02.161 --> 01:05:02.994
<v Speaker 3>and I'm the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary says there's an obstacle and </v>

1790
01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:04.974
<v Speaker 3>I'll knock down all obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all gonna knock down all the </v>

1791
01:05:06.421 --> 01:05:08.070
<v Speaker 3>obstacles and they erect new obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1792
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's in,</v>

1793
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:11.580
<v Speaker 3>what I've always said is nobody gives a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crap about you.</v>

1794
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Like no one cares about you.</v>

1795
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.550
<v Speaker 3>No one sitting around going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave Ruben,</v>

1796
01:05:14.551 --> 01:05:16.690
<v Speaker 3>I got to stop that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I stop Dave rule?</v>

1797
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 3>But there's a couple of people there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>

1798
01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:19.870
<v Speaker 3>there are a few people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1799
01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.340
<v Speaker 3>But as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a general matter,</v>

1800
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 3>if you weren't even in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're just a guy,</v>

1801
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would be sitting around going,</v>

1802
01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:28.020
<v Speaker 3>how do I stop Dave Rubin for becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful accountant right now?</v>

1803
01:05:28.021 --> 01:05:28.854
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And except that the government does do </v>

1804
01:05:31.421 --> 01:05:32.254
<v Speaker 3>that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if we could apply that same </v>

1805
01:05:33.761 --> 01:05:36.180
<v Speaker 3>sentiment to the government like nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's none.</v>

1806
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:37.600
<v Speaker 3>It's nobody's business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you do with your life,</v>

1807
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:40.510
<v Speaker 3>leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Solve your own problems,</v>

1808
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:41.733
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

1809
01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.990
<v Speaker 3>those few sentences in conjunction would</v>
<v Speaker 3>solve a lot of,</v>

1810
01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.310
<v Speaker 3>would solve a lot of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1811
01:05:45.311 --> 01:05:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Solve your own problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the government out of your life.</v>

1812
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:50.620
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares about you except like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your family and your friends,</v>

1813
01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:51.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1814
01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Know nobody's actively plotting against </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1815
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:55.090
<v Speaker 3>I know that we all live in our own </v>
<v Speaker 3>little movie and we did.</v>

1816
01:05:55.091 --> 01:05:57.550
<v Speaker 3>We all live in our movie where they're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great villains and you're the great hero</v>

1817
01:05:57.551 --> 01:05:59.560
<v Speaker 3>and we're all like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every human being is like this,</v>

1818
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:02.110
<v Speaker 3>which is why movies are successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in reality,</v>

1819
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:06.950
<v Speaker 3>how many people in a lifetime actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>have active enemies who are acquiring,</v>

1820
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:07.833
<v Speaker 3>attempting to thwart their every move?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how many people just have like </v>

1821
01:06:09.941 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 3>the jerk of a boss?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's bothering them.</v>

1822
01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.670
<v Speaker 3>Although oddly in our space now for </v>
<v Speaker 3>public people,</v>

1823
01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:18.550
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the enemies is growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

1824
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1825
01:06:19.571 --> 01:06:21.170
<v Speaker 3>For the regular person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1826
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:23.390
<v Speaker 3>it would be nice to think that now you </v>
<v Speaker 3>say regular,</v>

1827
01:06:23.391 --> 01:06:24.660
<v Speaker 3>we don't mean like less than we just </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1828
01:06:24.661 --> 01:06:25.870
<v Speaker 3>not politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1829
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:27.580
<v Speaker 3>I think people that are probably doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

1830
01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:30.490
<v Speaker 3>much more for the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we are but,</v>

1831
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:31.603
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that you stake out a </v>
<v Speaker 3>position now publicly and you </v>

1832
01:06:34.901 --> 01:06:36.040
<v Speaker 3>immediately have enemies.</v>

1833
01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:36.873
<v Speaker 3>I mean I see all the time now things </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be written about me that I know </v>

1834
01:06:38.951 --> 01:06:39.784
<v Speaker 3>were absolutely not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll call me your far right </v>

1835
01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:42.964
<v Speaker 3>winger and they'll all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I've said about this or that and </v>

1836
01:06:45.371 --> 01:06:46.204
<v Speaker 3>they misquote me or any of this or like </v>
<v Speaker 3>partial quote and it's like I could </v>

1837
01:06:49.001 --> 01:06:51.760
<v Speaker 3>spend the rest of my life fighting this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff or I can ignore it.</v>

1838
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:55.150
<v Speaker 3>And I usually try to ignore it because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to live somewhere.</v>

1839
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.550
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because of these topics have become</v>

1840
01:06:57.551 --> 01:07:02.410
<v Speaker 3>so intense because there is so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>control over how these things go.</v>

1841
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:05.200
<v Speaker 3>And also when one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the government's very small,</v>

1842
01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:06.423
<v Speaker 3>everyone on the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone on the inside is a little bit </v>

1843
01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:10.030
<v Speaker 3>fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean by that is everybody wants to</v>

1844
01:07:10.031 --> 01:07:11.080
<v Speaker 3>be the king,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1845
01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:13.210
<v Speaker 3>It's just you don't want anybody else to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the king.</v>

1846
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.930
<v Speaker 3>You want to be the king,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1847
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:15.873
<v Speaker 3>You'll be the good king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be the one person in human </v>

1848
01:07:16.811 --> 01:07:17.644
<v Speaker 3>history has been an excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excellent king who is always generous </v>

1849
01:07:20.561 --> 01:07:22.900
<v Speaker 3>with power and decent with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be too narrow,</v>

1850
01:07:22.901 --> 01:07:23.521
<v Speaker 3>storm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boring.</v>

1851
01:07:23.521 --> 01:07:24.354
<v Speaker 3>You're just gonna go around breaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>chains and everything's going to be </v>

1852
01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:29.800
<v Speaker 3>spectacular and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so as politics,</v>

1853
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:30.933
<v Speaker 3>when politics was small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't matter because the best </v>

1854
01:07:32.621 --> 01:07:34.400
<v Speaker 3>thing you could hope for to be your own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1855
01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fiefdom was your house,</v>

1856
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.000
<v Speaker 3>your fiefdom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're homeless,</v>

1857
01:07:37.001 --> 01:07:38.770
<v Speaker 3>your kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fiefdom was your family,</v>

1858
01:07:38.771 --> 01:07:39.604
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

1859
01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.533
<v Speaker 3>Those are the people you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those were your subjects and those were </v>

1860
01:07:41.921 --> 01:07:42.581
<v Speaker 3>your citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1861
01:07:42.581 --> 01:07:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Those were the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You took care of a,</v>

1862
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.710
<v Speaker 3>and now government is so big that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually have a shot at being king.</v>

1863
01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.753
<v Speaker 3>And when people think they have a shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>at being king or at least getting into </v>

1864
01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.080
<v Speaker 3>position a person who is going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>king for them,</v>

1865
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:56.200
<v Speaker 3>then you're an obstacle to their utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1866
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.033
<v Speaker 3>It trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if trump is utopia and I'm not voting </v>

1867
01:07:58.301 --> 01:07:59.350
<v Speaker 3>for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an obstacle to their,</v>

1868
01:07:59.351 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 3>you'd hope you have hillary is utopia </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's going to be the great,</v>

1869
01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:05.620
<v Speaker 3>the great chain breaker and I'm standing</v>
<v Speaker 3>in her way,</v>

1870
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:07.960
<v Speaker 3>then I'm an obstacle to utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1871
01:08:07.961 --> 01:08:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Everybody either becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I've said before,</v>

1872
01:08:09.491 --> 01:08:10.324
<v Speaker 3>a tool or an obstacle to utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think that utopia is realizable </v>

1873
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:15.920
<v Speaker 3>on a political level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't think that you're a fool,</v>

1874
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:17.990
<v Speaker 3>like one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I've,</v>

1875
01:08:17.991 --> 01:08:20.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there are certain areas where it</v>

1876
01:08:20.041 --> 01:08:20.874
<v Speaker 3>just in life you become more mature as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get older a little bit and you see </v>

1877
01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 3>more of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one is that when you're,</v>

1878
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.420
<v Speaker 3>when you're 18 or 19 or 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your utopian,</v>

1879
01:08:27.421 --> 01:08:28.254
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I solve this problem and this </v>

1880
01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:30.110
<v Speaker 3>problem won't be a problem ever again.</v>

1881
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.570
<v Speaker 3>And then you read more history and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal in politics more,</v>

1882
01:08:32.571 --> 01:08:34.520
<v Speaker 3>and you realize there's never a problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually goes away.</v>

1883
01:08:34.521 --> 01:08:36.770
<v Speaker 3>All the problems come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just a question of,</v>

1884
01:08:36.771 --> 01:08:38.360
<v Speaker 3>can you push the ball a little bit this </v>
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>

1885
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:39.253
<v Speaker 3>Can you push it a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit this way in favor of human </v>

1886
01:08:40.221 --> 01:08:41.180
<v Speaker 3>liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you push?</v>

1887
01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.193
<v Speaker 3>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you push the looming disaster a </v>

1888
01:08:43.191 --> 01:08:44.990
<v Speaker 3>little bit further down the road?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1889
01:08:44.991 --> 01:08:45.781
<v Speaker 3>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1890
01:08:45.781 --> 01:08:47.770
<v Speaker 3>and when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you become,</v>

1891
01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.330
<v Speaker 3>you become a problem for people who want</v>
<v Speaker 3>utopia.</v>

1892
01:08:50.331 --> 01:08:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Because Utopia requires a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be willing to sacrifice their present</v>

1893
01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:55.980
<v Speaker 3>for a future that doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1894
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.470
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a scary thing.</v>

1895
01:08:57.471 --> 01:08:58.910
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody's a little bit Utopian</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1896
01:08:58.911 --> 01:08:59.744
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's everyone's feeling that on both </v>

1897
01:09:01.431 --> 01:09:01.911
<v Speaker 3>sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1898
01:09:01.911 --> 01:09:04.190
<v Speaker 3>Because you could argue that the trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are feeling it.</v>

1899
01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.720
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna bring all the jobs back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ohio.</v>

1900
01:09:05.721 --> 01:09:06.860
<v Speaker 3>All of them are coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1901
01:09:06.861 --> 01:09:09.320
<v Speaker 3>He's going to make sure that we never </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a terrorist attack on American soil</v>

1902
01:09:09.321 --> 01:09:10.154
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to do it with his magic </v>

1903
01:09:10.941 --> 01:09:11.780
<v Speaker 3>wand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1904
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.850
<v Speaker 3>And he's going to do it by not trusting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the CIA or the FBI,</v>

1905
01:09:13.851 --> 01:09:14.684
<v Speaker 3>but still we'll get it done somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should pause there for a second </v>

1906
01:09:16.851 --> 01:09:17.684
<v Speaker 3>because what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you making that we were just </v>

1907
01:09:18.381 --> 01:09:23.381
<v Speaker 3>for one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what to do.</v>

1908
01:09:23.961 --> 01:09:24.621
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yes,</v>

1909
01:09:24.621 --> 01:09:26.580
<v Speaker 3>I think Russia hacked the DNC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1910
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:29.360
<v Speaker 3>do I think that it exposed things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

1911
01:09:29.361 --> 01:09:30.750
<v Speaker 3>you see the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1912
01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So was legit,</v>

1913
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:33.741
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1914
01:09:33.741 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Democrats are basically acknowledged</v>

1915
01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:37.730
<v Speaker 3>that the contents of it were real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't making things up.</v>

1916
01:09:37.731 --> 01:09:41.690
<v Speaker 3>So I think Russia was behind the hacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that shaped the election.</v>

1917
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Hillary would have lost anyway.</v>

1918
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.923
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a piece a few minutes ago about </v>

1919
01:09:46.581 --> 01:09:49.190
<v Speaker 3>this where I think that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence to that effect.</v>

1920
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:51.140
<v Speaker 3>One is that hillary is unfavorable </v>
<v Speaker 3>ratings.</v>

1921
01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:52.003
<v Speaker 3>In January of this year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before any of the wikileaks stuff </v>

1922
01:09:53.781 --> 01:09:55.940
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her favorable ratings were,</v>

1923
01:09:55.941 --> 01:09:58.670
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 43% favorable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1924
01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:00.050
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 38% favorable,</v>

1925
01:10:00.051 --> 01:10:03.580
<v Speaker 3>56% unfavorable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>November 4th through seventh.</v>

1926
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Right before the election,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was at 43% favorable,</v>

1927
01:10:06.561 --> 01:10:09.440
<v Speaker 3>56% unfavorable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she did not move at all.</v>

1928
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no point where she built,</v>

1929
01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.310
<v Speaker 3>she was consistently unpopular all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way across.</v>

1930
01:10:13.311 --> 01:10:14.144
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't wiki leaks made are unpopular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The big thing that hurt her in the last </v>

1931
01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:19.940
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks was the comey thing was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the FBI director saying he was reopening</v>

1932
01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:20.774
<v Speaker 3>the investigation and that had nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do with Wiki leaks that had to do </v>

1933
01:10:22.491 --> 01:10:25.520
<v Speaker 3>with Anthony Weiner's computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't the wikileaks that actually</v>

1934
01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:26.330
<v Speaker 3>shifted things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1935
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.781
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

1936
01:10:26.781 --> 01:10:27.614
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't the wikileaks per se that </v>

1937
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:31.130
<v Speaker 3>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1938
01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:32.750
<v Speaker 3>this is a case of shoe on the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>

1939
01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.820
<v Speaker 3>If the Russians had hacked the RNC and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump loses by 80,000</v>

1940
01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:39.410
<v Speaker 3>votes in three states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1941
01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:41.780
<v Speaker 3>Are we crying black or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or be up in arms.</v>

1942
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:42.121
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1943
01:10:42.121 --> 01:10:42.471
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1944
01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:43.161
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would we,</v>

1945
01:10:43.161 --> 01:10:44.130
<v Speaker 3>and would we be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1946
01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.190
<v Speaker 3>we have people on the right would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>crying bloody murder.</v>

1947
01:10:46.191 --> 01:10:47.930
<v Speaker 3>It'd be the end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1948
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.900
<v Speaker 3>the hypocrisy on both sides is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>astonishing.</v>

1949
01:10:49.901 --> 01:10:51.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm the on the left going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although those evil,</v>

1950
01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:52.460
<v Speaker 3>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evil Russians,</v>

1951
01:10:52.461 --> 01:10:53.810
<v Speaker 3>they're so evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate the Russians.</v>

1952
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.110
<v Speaker 3>In 2012 Obama was openly saying caught </v>
<v Speaker 3>on microphone.</v>

1953
01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:59.780
<v Speaker 3>I want flexibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can give flexibility to Russia if they</v>

1954
01:10:59.781 --> 01:11:02.300
<v Speaker 3>helped me out in this election cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>

1955
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:03.343
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Months of when Romney said they're our </v>

1956
01:11:04.911 --> 01:11:07.010
<v Speaker 3>biggest geopolitical foe and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>mocked him.</v>

1957
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and also within months of hint of,</v>

1958
01:11:08.751 --> 01:11:09.584
<v Speaker 3>of Obama backing off the red line in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Syria and within two years of him </v>

1959
01:11:12.411 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 3>backing off of the Ukraine stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1960
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.830
<v Speaker 3>And so they didn't care about Russia for</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

1961
01:11:16.831 --> 01:11:18.930
<v Speaker 3>but now they care deeply about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>threat of Russian on the right.</v>

1962
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:20.003
<v Speaker 3>The same people going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia's our major geopolitical foe in </v>

1963
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:23.610
<v Speaker 3>20 [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see the problem with gluten.</v>

1964
01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Well why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't we be friends with Putin who,</v>

1965
01:11:25.121 --> 01:11:26.160
<v Speaker 3>how's this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's this a problem?</v>

1966
01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:27.600
<v Speaker 3>And say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my goodness.</v>

1967
01:11:27.601 --> 01:11:28.171
<v Speaker 3>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your,</v>

1968
01:11:28.171 --> 01:11:29.004
<v Speaker 3>if your belief switch that fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go with you really had not </v>

1969
01:11:30.901 --> 01:11:31.734
<v Speaker 3>a lot of core.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to me because I can't really figure </v>

1970
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:37.790
<v Speaker 3>out what the actual truth is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone really knows that.</v>

1971
01:11:37.791 --> 01:11:38.624
<v Speaker 3>We haven't seen the right out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>question is do you believe the CIA and </v>

1972
01:11:40.681 --> 01:11:43.620
<v Speaker 3>the FBI or do you believe self motivated</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on both sides?</v>

1973
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.753
<v Speaker 3>Although right now it sounds like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>CIA and FBI aren't even in complete </v>

1974
01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:50.500
<v Speaker 3>agreement on what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They both do agree that the,</v>

1975
01:11:50.501 --> 01:11:53.160
<v Speaker 3>that the Russian sources were behind the</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks,</v>

1976
01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:54.540
<v Speaker 3>they just don't agree on what the motive</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1977
01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:55.081
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1978
01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:58.620
<v Speaker 3>So the FBI says it was to undermine the </v>
<v Speaker 3>election integrity and the CIA says that</v>

1979
01:11:58.621 --> 01:12:00.480
<v Speaker 3>it was to get trump elected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1980
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Given trump's position stated positions </v>
<v Speaker 3>on Putin,</v>

1981
01:12:02.431 --> 01:12:04.200
<v Speaker 3>which were incredibly warm throughout </v>
<v Speaker 3>the campaign,</v>

1982
01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:06.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't find the CIA's claim </v>
<v Speaker 3>implausible,</v>

1983
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:07.860
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their motives doesn't,</v>

1984
01:12:07.861 --> 01:12:08.694
<v Speaker 3>don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bottom line is did they shift the </v>

1985
01:12:09.871 --> 01:12:11.820
<v Speaker 3>election?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no evidence they did.</v>

1986
01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.820
<v Speaker 3>So the reason I guess I'm a little more </v>
<v Speaker 3>skeptical is that if,</v>

1987
01:12:14.821 --> 01:12:16.970
<v Speaker 3>let's say we really knew it was true at </v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1988
01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:21.630
<v Speaker 3>that this was true technic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't that basically be an act of war</v>

1989
01:12:21.631 --> 01:12:22.301
<v Speaker 3>at this point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

1990
01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:23.134
<v Speaker 3>if Obama knew right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the FBI or CIA came to him that this </v>

1991
01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:27.174
<v Speaker 3>actually happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were in cahoots with trump or </v>

1992
01:12:29.371 --> 01:12:31.560
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would be an act.</v>

1993
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:35.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean either way down sanctions or some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of military,</v>

1994
01:12:35.521 --> 01:12:36.354
<v Speaker 3>I mean that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a true undermining of our </v>

1995
01:12:37.621 --> 01:12:41.460
<v Speaker 3>democracy at the highest levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the fact that we're not talking about</v>

1996
01:12:41.461 --> 01:12:42.930
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that I want to be a war with Russia,</v>

1997
01:12:42.931 --> 01:12:44.310
<v Speaker 3>I would be completely again against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1998
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:48.120
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that it's not getting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that level shows me that this seems like</v>

1999
01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:52.450
<v Speaker 3>more of a game or political showmanship </v>
<v Speaker 3>then something that's real.</v>

2000
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.020
<v Speaker 3>It also demonstrates a massive increase </v>
<v Speaker 3>in partisanship.</v>

2001
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.943
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I say that is because go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to 1972 and Richard Nixon is </v>

2002
01:12:58.981 --> 01:12:59.814
<v Speaker 3>bugging the Watergate Hotel and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempt to get information about </v>

2003
01:13:02.161 --> 01:13:02.970
<v Speaker 3>mcgovern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2004
01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:05.250
<v Speaker 3>And he's swamps mcgovern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty clear that he didn't need to</v>

2005
01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:07.290
<v Speaker 3>bug the hotel in order to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

2006
01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:09.570
<v Speaker 3>Matt mcgovern to swamp them make up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>winds like two states.</v>

2007
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.673
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he's impeached by row </v>

2008
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:13.670
<v Speaker 3>Republicans.</v>

2009
01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:15.720
<v Speaker 3>Republicans are getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's not technically he retires,</v>

2010
01:13:15.721 --> 01:13:17.430
<v Speaker 3>but he's about to be impeached by </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans.</v>

2011
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Or Republicans are going to impeach him </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

2012
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Now you have a foreign power doing what </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nixon did write the exact same thing and</v>

2013
01:13:22.801 --> 01:13:23.850
<v Speaker 3>they bugged the DNC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2014
01:13:23.851 --> 01:13:24.511
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

2015
01:13:24.511 --> 01:13:25.344
<v Speaker 3>that the allegation and nobody on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right cares and nobody on the right </v>

2016
01:13:29.001 --> 01:13:29.341
<v Speaker 3>care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2017
01:13:29.341 --> 01:13:30.840
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that has to do with,</v>

2018
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people aren't taking this seriously.</v>

2019
01:13:32.701 --> 01:13:35.310
<v Speaker 3>I think that one of the questions is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2020
01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.753
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how happy are you that they did it and </v>

2021
01:13:38.011 --> 01:13:38.844
<v Speaker 3>when the question is and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think that there are a lot of </v>

2022
01:13:40.531 --> 01:13:41.700
<v Speaker 3>people on the right guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2023
01:13:41.701 --> 01:13:43.020
<v Speaker 3>it's good they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind that they did it.</v>

2024
01:13:43.021 --> 01:13:44.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after all hillary had it coming,</v>

2025
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:45.623
<v Speaker 3>that's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So didn't mcgovern kind of in the sense </v>

2026
01:13:47.431 --> 01:13:48.264
<v Speaker 3>that the government was awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't really change the </v>

2027
01:13:50.011 --> 01:13:50.844
<v Speaker 3>activity.</v>

2028
01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:51.803
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't the other piece of this that if </v>

2029
01:13:52.981 --> 01:13:53.814
<v Speaker 3>this all happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it show ineptitude at the </v>

2030
01:13:56.341 --> 01:13:58.770
<v Speaker 3>highest levels of our current </v>
<v Speaker 3>government?</v>

2031
01:13:58.771 --> 01:13:59.604
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that Obama in self would be making </v>

2032
01:14:01.711 --> 01:14:02.544
<v Speaker 3>decisions related to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you'd have to fire almost everyone </v>

2033
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:08.250
<v Speaker 3>at every security service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then at the DNC,</v>

2034
01:14:08.251 --> 01:14:09.930
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody was responsible for the,</v>

2035
01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.640
<v Speaker 3>for the security of the DNC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2036
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.680
<v Speaker 3>But it has been government agencies </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently there,</v>

2037
01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:14.533
<v Speaker 3>there's some hacking of government </v>
<v Speaker 3>agencies has been going on for a while </v>

2038
01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:16.784
<v Speaker 3>and the word cyber war with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with China and we have been for a long </v>

2039
01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:19.330
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2040
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:20.860
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the government,</v>

2041
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.903
<v Speaker 3>as I've said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>socks at virtually everything and the </v>

2042
01:14:24.161 --> 01:14:26.260
<v Speaker 3>solution seems to be more government </v>
<v Speaker 3>from both sides.</v>

2043
01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Now the year of small government is over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

2044
01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:30.430
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the government is going to</v>

2045
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:33.010
<v Speaker 3>shrink in any margin in any measurable </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

2046
01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:34.450
<v Speaker 3>I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is fallacy.</v>

2047
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.350
<v Speaker 2>So on the history repeats itself for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long game idea.</v>

2048
01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.580
<v Speaker 2>There is opportunity here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2049
01:14:38.581 --> 01:14:39.414
<v Speaker 2>Because let it get big so that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>will ultimately see that it does not </v>

2050
01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:43.710
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2051
01:14:44.010 --> 01:14:47.390
<v Speaker 2>and then the era of small government may</v>
<v Speaker 2>be can come or do you think is right and</v>

2052
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.230
<v Speaker 2>get to a tipping point where you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't come back.</v>

2053
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

2054
01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.040
<v Speaker 3>I do think that you get to a tipping </v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

2055
01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.810
<v Speaker 3>but it sounded tipping point where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't come back.</v>

2056
01:14:52.811 --> 01:14:54.570
<v Speaker 3>It's a tipping point where we actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit disaster right here,</v>

2057
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:57.460
<v Speaker 3>the Greek tipping point where at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain point you must hit the austerity</v>

2058
01:14:57.461 --> 01:14:58.294
<v Speaker 3>button because otherwise your country is</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely bankrupt and then you get </v>

2059
01:15:00.581 --> 01:15:02.470
<v Speaker 3>riots in the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the question is how,</v>

2060
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.300
<v Speaker 3>how ugly are things when reality sets </v>
<v Speaker 3>in?</v>

2061
01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Because the reality is you can't keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>affording to pay for all of this stuff.</v>

2062
01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.093
<v Speaker 3>Eventually one of two things happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>either wise up or you go bankrupt like </v>

2063
01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.510
<v Speaker 3>California's about to do when things get</v>
<v Speaker 3>really ugly.</v>

2064
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:14.583
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the question is which one we head </v>

2065
01:15:16.181 --> 01:15:20.530
<v Speaker 3>toward and the fact that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gains of sort of the Buckley,</v>

2066
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.393
<v Speaker 3>Reagan conservative small government era</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been put behind us in favor of this </v>

2067
01:15:25.691 --> 01:15:27.760
<v Speaker 3>bigger government nationalist populism.</v>

2068
01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.820
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good sign that we're moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>in in the wising up direction.</v>

2069
01:15:30.821 --> 01:15:33.640
<v Speaker 3>It's actually a sign that we're moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the opposite and that word that we're</v>

2070
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:35.230
<v Speaker 3>kind of now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2071
01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:35.981
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government's peg,</v>

2072
01:15:35.981 --> 01:15:38.890
<v Speaker 3>we except the government's big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What can the government do for me today?</v>

2073
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2074
01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.170
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

2075
01:15:41.171 --> 01:15:42.004
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why like people were very </v>

2076
01:15:43.571 --> 01:15:45.690
<v Speaker 3>intense during the campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conservatives saying,</v>

2077
01:15:45.691 --> 01:15:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Mike Pence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump selects him.</v>

2078
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:48.183
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that great?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very enthusiastic about the </v>

2079
01:15:49.271 --> 01:15:49.980
<v Speaker 3>pens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peck.</v>

2080
01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:50.711
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2081
01:15:50.711 --> 01:15:51.544
<v Speaker 3>Mike Pence seems good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got my pencil now going </v>

2082
01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:54.364
<v Speaker 3>around to rallies with Donald Trump is </v>
<v Speaker 3>free markets here saying that he's okay </v>

2083
01:15:57.941 --> 01:15:58.774
<v Speaker 3>with tariffs and saying the free market </v>
<v Speaker 3>fails when it's tried and from going </v>

2084
01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:03.670
<v Speaker 3>every time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time.</v>

2085
01:16:03.671 --> 01:16:04.870
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2086
01:16:04.871 --> 01:16:05.161
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2087
01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:05.741
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2088
01:16:05.741 --> 01:16:07.810
<v Speaker 3>That's very sick coming from trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2089
01:16:07.811 --> 01:16:09.430
<v Speaker 3>That trump's been saying that stick the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole time.</v>

2090
01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.320
<v Speaker 3>But like pence rally good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At what point until we,</v>

2091
01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:15.190
<v Speaker 3>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to see,</v>

2092
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.203
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really where the Republican party lies </v>

2093
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:20.310
<v Speaker 3>until the first conflict between trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the republicans.</v>

2094
01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.393
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there enough republicans who are </v>

2095
01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.700
<v Speaker 3>going to stand up against him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so either.</v>

2096
01:16:24.701 --> 01:16:25.534
<v Speaker 3>And I think the trump has building </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine outside government in order to </v>

2097
01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:28.720
<v Speaker 3>take down the ones who do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2098
01:16:28.721 --> 01:16:29.201
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2099
01:16:29.201 --> 01:16:31.150
<v Speaker 3>he has Kellyanne Conway building this </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2100
01:16:31.151 --> 01:16:31.984
<v Speaker 3>this apparently this machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to seek to push his message </v>

2101
01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:37.120
<v Speaker 3>outside government and maybe primary </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who,</v>

2102
01:16:37.121 --> 01:16:39.280
<v Speaker 3>who don't grant him the leeway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2103
01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:41.293
<v Speaker 2>such a sad state of affairs because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we've never needed a strong </v>

2104
01:16:43.251 --> 01:16:45.890
<v Speaker 2>independent fourth the state more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2105
01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:46.733
<v Speaker 2>That's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That functions properly now and it's </v>

2106
01:16:48.531 --> 01:16:50.410
<v Speaker 2>exactly what we don't have.</v>

2107
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this is a,</v>

2108
01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:52.274
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying this now for several </v>
<v Speaker 3>months and I was thinking during the </v>

2109
01:16:54.801 --> 01:16:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Obama era too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it was clear that the country is</v>

2110
01:16:57.471 --> 01:17:01.370
<v Speaker 3>ready for a demagogic fashion efficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>stick leader.</v>

2111
01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Cause they just want something done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2112
01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:04.010
<v Speaker 3>That's the fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people,</v>

2113
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:08.120
<v Speaker 3>the Word Fascism always brings to mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazis and Jack boots and all this stuff.</v>

2114
01:17:08.121 --> 01:17:12.650
<v Speaker 3>But the truth is that most kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most dictatorial governments don't start</v>

2115
01:17:12.651 --> 01:17:14.060
<v Speaker 3>off that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of them start off with,</v>

2116
01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:15.470
<v Speaker 3>we have a breakdown in the political </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

2117
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:17.000
<v Speaker 3>We need somebody to do something right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2118
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Right now there are too many pressing </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

2119
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Get somebody in there to fix it right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2120
01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 3>And if you look back at history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most dictatorial governments don't start</v>

2121
01:17:24.951 --> 01:17:25.784
<v Speaker 3>with the ultimately bad dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start with a couple of educators </v>

2122
01:17:27.651 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 3>who actually are not quite as bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2123
01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:30.730
<v Speaker 3>If you look at it like Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1930,</v>

2124
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:34.310
<v Speaker 3>1932 you're looking at at people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually aren't that bad,</v>

2125
01:17:34.311 --> 01:17:35.144
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at it bruning and you're </v>

2126
01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:38.030
<v Speaker 3>looking at it on paper and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at a bunch of people who,</v>

2127
01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.033
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are I hurt people who are like </v>

2128
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:45.170
<v Speaker 3>basically not terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awful human beings,</v>

2129
01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:46.483
<v Speaker 3>but the centralize all the power here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the next person who sweeps in </v>

2130
01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:49.700
<v Speaker 3>is the bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2131
01:17:49.701 --> 01:17:51.500
<v Speaker 3>So whether you think that Obama was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad guy,</v>

2132
01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:52.334
<v Speaker 3>whether you think trump is the bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you bring all the power to one </v>

2133
01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:55.590
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you've created the,</v>

2134
01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.433
<v Speaker 3>once you forged the ring of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's only a matter of time before </v>

2135
01:17:59.001 --> 01:18:00.680
<v Speaker 3>the bad guy gets ahold of the ring of </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

2136
01:18:00.681 --> 01:18:01.514
<v Speaker 3>Unless you destroy the ring of power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you'll have a bunch of people </v>

2137
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.120
<v Speaker 3>who are seduced by the ring of power.</v>

2138
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:06.403
<v Speaker 3>But eventually somebody bad we'll get </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahold of eventually he'll bring a power </v>

2139
01:18:08.661 --> 01:18:09.494
<v Speaker 3>will make its way back to sal Ron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you may think that trump isn't the </v>

2140
01:18:11.001 --> 01:18:12.590
<v Speaker 3>guy who's the threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fine.</v>

2141
01:18:12.591 --> 01:18:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2142
01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:17.150
<v Speaker 3>I assume that he isn't because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really see that we necessarily is.</v>

2143
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:18.343
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you think Obama wasn't the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you think that Obama wasn't the </v>

2144
01:18:20.181 --> 01:18:22.280
<v Speaker 3>true threat to American democracy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberalism,</v>

2145
01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.670
<v Speaker 3>but once you've got this much power in </v>
<v Speaker 3>one place,</v>

2146
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.433
<v Speaker 3>somebody will be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody will be elected at some point </v>

2147
01:18:28.731 --> 01:18:30.710
<v Speaker 3>who just says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screw all of the norms.</v>

2148
01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Things have to get done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trains have to run on time.</v>

2149
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.883
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not only</v>

2150
01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.480
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may not be the guy you like,</v>

2151
01:18:35.481 --> 01:18:36.830
<v Speaker 2>it could be someone heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be somebody.</v>

2152
01:18:36.831 --> 01:18:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That metaphor was pretty good,</v>

2153
01:18:38.871 --> 01:18:40.610
<v Speaker 2>but can you get that into a star wars </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>

2154
01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you get that into some?</v>

2155
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.333
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2156
01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:46.100
<v Speaker 3>there were no real good way to destroy </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dark side of the force,</v>

2157
01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:46.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2158
01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:48.930
<v Speaker 3>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it's,</v>

2159
01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.300
<v Speaker 3>it's not quite as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not quite as good,</v>

2160
01:18:50.301 --> 01:18:52.490
<v Speaker 3>but everybody is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody has to do so well.</v>

2161
01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants to be darth Vader,</v>

2162
01:18:54.291 --> 01:18:54.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2163
01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.300
<v Speaker 3>When you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to be Luke skywalker.</v>

2164
01:18:56.301 --> 01:18:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants to be darth Vader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>darth vader.</v>

2165
01:18:57.501 --> 01:18:59.030
<v Speaker 3>As much cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can strangle people,</v>

2166
01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.140
<v Speaker 3>but his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2167
01:19:00.141 --> 01:19:01.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he can relate to it.</v>

2168
01:19:01.671 --> 01:19:03.710
<v Speaker 3>It's much cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only one problem,</v>

2169
01:19:03.711 --> 01:19:04.544
<v Speaker 3>which is that you also have to build </v>
<v Speaker 3>this enormous staffs starting below </v>

2170
01:19:05.671 --> 01:19:08.570
<v Speaker 3>planets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So eventually the powers,</v>

2171
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.101
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in.</v>

2172

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I get this tweeted at me a lot.</v>

2177
01:19:17.621 --> 01:19:19.360
<v Speaker 2>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

2178
01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:23.740
<v Speaker 2>you should run for president in 2020,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the second part of the ticket,</v>

2179
01:19:23.741 --> 01:19:24.574
<v Speaker 2>Shapiro</v>

2180
01:19:25.050 --> 01:19:25.883
<v Speaker 3>number wine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd show people that bridges can be </v>

2181
01:19:27.261 --> 01:19:27.831
<v Speaker 3>built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2182
01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:28.664
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

2183
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:32.150
<v Speaker 3>Would you ever go into politics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in California.</v>

2184
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.931
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2185
01:19:32.931 --> 01:19:34.940
<v Speaker 3>and given the way that our current </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics is going,</v>

2186
01:19:34.941 --> 01:19:36.740
<v Speaker 3>it seems like only celebrities can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>elected.</v>

2187
01:19:36.741 --> 01:19:38.000
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2188
01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:39.500
<v Speaker 3>well you'll have that part down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2189
01:19:39.501 --> 01:19:40.760
<v Speaker 3>you have your following.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2190
01:19:41.050 --> 01:19:41.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2191
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.553
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have to be a lot larger </v>

2192
01:19:43.221 --> 01:19:45.290
<v Speaker 3>following than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right on that necessarily.</v>

2193
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:46.383
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2194
01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.670
<v Speaker 3>it's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I could see doing at some point.</v>

2195
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2196
01:19:50.781 --> 01:19:52.790
<v Speaker 3>2020 is a little soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2197
01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.240
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2198
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:55.850
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2199
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:58.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not averse to the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of running for office at some point,</v>

2200
01:19:58.941 --> 01:20:02.240
<v Speaker 3>but it depends on whether you can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>more good outside of government.</v>

2201
01:20:02.241 --> 01:20:03.074
<v Speaker 3>You're inside government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you want to destroy the </v>

2202
01:20:04.101 --> 01:20:05.380
<v Speaker 3>instrument itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2203
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.373
<v Speaker 3>so is it not just read the entirety of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the government to destroy a lot of the </v>

2204
01:20:09.031 --> 01:20:10.010
<v Speaker 3>power of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2205
01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.073
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

2206
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:13.950
<v Speaker 2>so it sorta could never in a way you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffer from.</v>

2207
01:20:13.951 --> 01:20:14.784
<v Speaker 2>Although I know you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling the truth with a little bit </v>

2208
01:20:15.961 --> 01:20:18.290
<v Speaker 2>with Rand Paul and a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2209
01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:19.163
<v Speaker 2>you'd suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd suffer [inaudible] policy by the </v>

2210
01:20:20.521 --> 01:20:21.780
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with a lot of what Ram I'll ask.</v>

2211
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2212
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:23.940
<v Speaker 2>but I know in foreign policy and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>

2213
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.250
<v Speaker 2>but you would suffer from the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he suffered from,</v>

2214
01:20:26.251 --> 01:20:29.160
<v Speaker 2>which is I'm the out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make this thing smaller.</v>

2215
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:29.994
<v Speaker 2>You're even if you're all conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still trying to make it bigger </v>

2216
01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.920
<v Speaker 2>for the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't really rally around you cause it,</v>

2217
01:20:34.921 --> 01:20:36.900
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really fit the way people </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

2218
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that</v>

2219
01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:42.760
<v Speaker 3>to benefit from backlash politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have,</v>

2220
01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:43.893
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there could come a point where </v>

2221
01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:45.214
<v Speaker 3>government is so big that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually willing to hear a message of </v>

2222
01:20:47.021 --> 01:20:48.610
<v Speaker 3>solve your own problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Screw the government.</v>

2223
01:20:48.611 --> 01:20:49.444
<v Speaker 3>These people have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have destroyed lives and power </v>

2224
01:20:51.941 --> 01:20:53.620
<v Speaker 3>centralizing in one place is not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

2225
01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:55.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2226
01:20:55.930 --> 01:20:56.763
<v Speaker 3>people will have to be convinced of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because until then everybody has the </v>

2227
01:21:00.370 --> 01:21:02.920
<v Speaker 3>everybody on the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once that ring,</v>

2228
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:04.490
<v Speaker 3>everybody inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once the,</v>

2229
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.010
<v Speaker 3>the dark side of the force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2230
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:08.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my job right now is the same as yours,</v>

2231
01:21:08.741 --> 01:21:12.550
<v Speaker 3>which is tell people the Truth and hope </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they awakened to the fact that your</v>

2232
01:21:12.551 --> 01:21:14.280
<v Speaker 3>life is in your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2233
01:21:14.410 --> 01:21:16.240
<v Speaker 3>and if it's not in your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we need to,</v>

2234
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:17.103
<v Speaker 3>we need to change the system so that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is in your hands and people aren't </v>

2235
01:21:18.881 --> 01:21:19.714
<v Speaker 3>taking things away from you or promising</v>
<v Speaker 3>you things because the promise is just </v>

2236
01:21:21.701 --> 01:21:23.500
<v Speaker 3>another way to take something away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2237
01:21:23.501 --> 01:21:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your actual,</v>

2238
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:25.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2239
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:28.450
<v Speaker 3>your actual self control and self </v>
<v Speaker 3>esteem.</v>

2240
01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.553
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody makes a promise to give you </v>

2241
01:21:31.031 --> 01:21:32.770
<v Speaker 3>something and they're taking something </v>
<v Speaker 3>away from you too.</v>

2242
01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.940
<v Speaker 3>Nothing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing is free.</v>

2243
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:35.740
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to be totally self </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficient,</v>

2244
01:21:35.741 --> 01:21:38.770
<v Speaker 3>then we need an actual place that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>allows self sufficiency.</v>

2245
01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought if you,</v>

2246
01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:42.530
<v Speaker 2>if someone gives you something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's free.</v>

2247
01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:44.120
<v Speaker 2>You mean that someone else is paying for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2248
01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:44.991
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out,</v>

2249
01:21:44.991 --> 01:21:46.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

2250
01:21:46.461 --> 01:21:47.294
<v Speaker 2>I have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that inability to understand that </v>

2251
01:21:48.681 --> 01:21:49.910
<v Speaker 2>may be screwing all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2252
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Guilty liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2253
01:21:52.161 --> 01:21:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2254
01:21:53.001 --> 01:21:54.220
<v Speaker 2>well it was a pleasure talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

2255
01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Great to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our,</v>

2256
01:21:55.941 --> 01:21:56.774
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your office is not that far from my new </v>

2257
01:21:58.941 --> 01:21:59.381
<v Speaker 2>student.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2258
01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:00.214
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I suspect we'll be doing a lot more </v>

2259
01:22:01.551 --> 01:22:03.110
<v Speaker 2>of these crossovers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we could,</v>

2260
01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2020.</v>

2261
01:22:04.851 --> 01:22:06.410
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

2262
01:22:06.411 --> 01:22:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I just could never be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be vice president.</v>

2263
01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2264
01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a cush job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

2265
01:22:10.341 --> 01:22:10.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2266
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:13.100
<v Speaker 3>he just sit there and you go to like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice house and</v>

2267
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I've yet to meet Joe Biden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2268
01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I'd be very good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2269
01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:21.010
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you'd be much better in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of the big anyway,</v>

2270
01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for more on Ben Shapiro,</v>

2271
01:22:23.081 --> 01:22:23.914
<v Speaker 2>follow him on twitter at Ben Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried not to send him Nazi memes if </v>

2272
01:22:27.911 --> 01:22:28.744
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2273
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:29.620
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do,</v>

2274
01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.210

<v Speaker 2>really just take pleasure in them and </v>

2276
01:22:32.831 --> 01:22:33.664
<v Speaker 2>enjoy them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so there you go.</v>

2278
01:22:35.081 --> 01:22:35.914
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
