1
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I'd</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.563
<v Speaker 2>like to believe that critical thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>is woven into pretty much everything we </v>

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.284
<v Speaker 2>do here on the Rubin report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but today's show is going to have an </v>

4
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 2>even keener focus on this all </v>
<v Speaker 2>encompassing topic.</v>

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether we're talking about politics,</v>

6
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or current events,</v>

7
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.740
<v Speaker 2>it all boils down to critical thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the definition of which is quote,</v>

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.350
<v Speaker 2>the objective analysis and evaluation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue in order to form a judgment end</v>

9
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:28.614
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we really look at the world the way </v>

10
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 2>it truly is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the way we want it to be.</v>

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.283
<v Speaker 2>Can we set aside our faith based hopes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to analyze real world problems or his </v>

12
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:38.784
<v Speaker 2>faith actually a part of the problem as </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to being the solution each week </v>

13
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:44.394
<v Speaker 2>I try to have conversations that exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this space without resorting to ad </v>

14
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 2>hominem attacks and Straw man arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guiding principle is fully based in</v>

15
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 2>critical thinking and moral reasoning.</v>

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Joining me this week is Peter </v>
<v Speaker 2>Boghossian,</v>

17
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.263
<v Speaker 2>philosophy instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>critical thinker and author of a manual </v>

18
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 2>for creating atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter's book is a really incisive,</v>

19
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 2>clear take on why critical thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>

20
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 2>how faith based thinking can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>

21
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:09.444
<v Speaker 2>and also relates what you can do to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spread ideas based on fact and reason </v>

22
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.093
<v Speaker 2>with your friends and family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He writes in an understandable and </v>

23
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 2>relatable style on topics that many are </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid to touch on,</v>

24
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.483
<v Speaker 2>even with the people closest to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gives the reader the very tools to </v>

25
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 2>help people trapped by faith based </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

26
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did say help.</v>

27
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Their help is exactly what I believe is </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed in this situation.</v>

28
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 2>When your beliefs aren't based in reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>and critical thinking,</v>

29
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 2>it creates a space where extremism can </v>
<v Speaker 2>creep in.</v>

30
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.643
<v Speaker 2>This of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't beholden to one religion or </v>

31
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you throw reason in fact out the</v>

32
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 2>window to trade it with ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't provable,</v>

33
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 2>you create the very breeding ground that</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremism needs to spread.</v>

34
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not a coincidence that in places </v>
<v Speaker 2>where gays,</v>

35
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:57.084
<v Speaker 2>women and minorities are treated poorly </v>
<v Speaker 2>are also the places where religion has </v>

36
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 2>often been a substitute for clear moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

37
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

38
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 2>we here in the West could do a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>better job of this ourselves.</v>

39
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 2>I know we're more focused on Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremism on this show,</v>

40
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 2>but there are all kinds of extremism in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

41
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.163
<v Speaker 2>You can't deal with any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies with half truths and by </v>

42
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:20.274
<v Speaker 2>shooting the messengers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must deal with them by looking at </v>

43
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 2>them head on and tackling the ideologies</v>
<v Speaker 2>with better ideas and moral clarity.</v>

44
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 2>We live in a time when religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremism is on the rise.</v>

45
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.343
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to guess that we probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have many religious extremists </v>

46
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:34.704
<v Speaker 2>watching this show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know how much of an effect I </v>

47
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 2>can have on those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that I can have an effect on,</v>

48
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:41.154
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you guys people out there from every </v>

49
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:43.974
<v Speaker 2>walk of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from all over the globe who want to do </v>

50
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 2>the work of finding out what brings us </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

51
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 2>not what tears us apart.</v>

52
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I firmly believe that critical thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the solution.</v>

53
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Critical thinking doesn't care about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your race,</v>

54
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:57.444
<v Speaker 2>your sexuality or your nationality is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>roadmap to solving serious issues and </v>

55
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.674
<v Speaker 2>combating superstitious thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has led to many real world </v>

56
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:06.964
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much of the right in America is led by </v>

57
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Christian religious ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much of the left,</v>

58
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:11.974
<v Speaker 2>while not guided by religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has become as dogmatic in its beliefs </v>

59
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.910
<v Speaker 2>between the two is where most clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>minded free thinking people live.</v>

60
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.460
<v Speaker 2>It's what my guest on next week show Ali</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rizvi he refers to as the new center.</v>

61
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.903
<v Speaker 2>I think by letting go of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>superstitions and focusing on real </v>

62
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 2>solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can change the world for the better.</v>

63
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.113
<v Speaker 2>Either that or we can leave it up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>zealots after all the world is what you </v>

64
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:38.014
<v Speaker 2>make of it.</v>

65
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Peter goes in as a philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>instructor,</v>

66
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 2>critical thinker and author of a manual </v>
<v Speaker 2>for creating atheists.</v>

67
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 2>He's also an anterior aggressive warrior</v>
<v Speaker 2>and can back it up with some Jujitsu.</v>

68
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.263
<v Speaker 2>Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome to the show.</v>

69
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me.</v>

70
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Really looking forward to our chat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am looking forward to it as well.</v>

71
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:57.394
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every week I feel like I'm connecting </v>

72
00:03:59.021 --> 00:03:59.854
<v Speaker 2>with people that I know in the digital </v>
<v Speaker 2>space and mostly through 140 characters </v>

73
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 2>and I put you in that group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just did three hours with Rogan.</v>

74
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had an interesting conversation.</v>

75
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.800
<v Speaker 2>How you feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You came up,</v>

76
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 2>you came up to good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel great.</v>

77
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 2>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he say good things about me?</v>

78
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 2>We said nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

79
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

80
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:17.614
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it is when people are </v>

81
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 2>together and they're sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they'll,</v>

82
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.723
<v Speaker 2>they'll either agree or disagree or </v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a convergence around those </v>

83
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

84
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 2>And I started off when we were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that I feel like I know you,</v>

85
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 2>like I feel that the stuff that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about and the values that you have</v>

86
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 2>are in congruence with my own values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think part of that comes from,</v>

87
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 2>from the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>type of honesty with oneself.</v>

88
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we're obviously going to talk a lot</v>

89
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.190
<v Speaker 2>about those values and I think it really</v>
<v Speaker 2>is cool that this,</v>

90
00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:51.024
<v Speaker 2>this group of people come together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were sort of in this a little bit </v>

91
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 2>before me and connected with Sam and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of those other guys,</v>

92
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 2>but now Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina Hoff,</v>

93
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:00.154
<v Speaker 2>sommers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people who don't necessarily </v>

94
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:02.494
<v Speaker 2>agree on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't come from the same walks of life </v>

95
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 2>or the same socioeconomic separate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

96
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 2>that we've all sort of come together </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have these base principles,</v>

97
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 2>apps that we want to put out there.</v>

98
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>

99
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 2>And I think that it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's one way to think about it.</v>

100
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 2>We often think about the right and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left on some kind of align.</v>

101
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.173
<v Speaker 2>So there's the far right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously on the far right of </v>

102
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 2>the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the far left and the middle.</v>

103
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.193
<v Speaker 2>There's this philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a French philosopher has this </v>

104
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:32.134
<v Speaker 2>idea of a horseshoe theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take the ends of the line and you </v>

105
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:35.284
<v Speaker 2>bend them together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The far left and the far right are </v>

106
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 2>closer to each other than they are to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the center.</v>

107
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that that's a helpful </v>

108
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 2>heuristic or helpful way to look at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these issues.</v>

109
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 2>And for me it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:54.650
<v Speaker 2>rather than give a geological account </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how this came to be for,</v>

111
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's always interesting is when</v>

112
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 3>I look at the mean spiritedness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anger,</v>

113
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.073
<v Speaker 3>the tactics of the regressives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just so fundamentally contrary </v>

114
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 3>to what my values are and for the sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of person that I want to become.</v>

115
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

116
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.771
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

117
00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:15.604
<v Speaker 3>and I do see that that horseshoe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that far left in that far right and the </v>

118
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:20.114
<v Speaker 3>left the regressive seem extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry and eager to smear those people </v>

119
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 3>with racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>

120
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 3>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

121
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.793
<v Speaker 3>If you don't buy into certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you ask questions as opposed to </v>

122
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 3>buying into something they have made any</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of discourse almost impossible.</v>

123
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

124
00:06:33.841 --> 00:06:35.730
<v Speaker 2>we've talked a lIttle bit about that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>i.</v>

125
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Sam said something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sam harris said something about how it's</v>

126
00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.800
<v Speaker 2>almost like scorched earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm loosely quoting what he said</v>

127
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.890
<v Speaker 2>because the tactics have been so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But before we get into all that,</v>

128
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.903
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about you a little bit so </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can understand where you come </v>

129
00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:47.790
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this and,</v>

130
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:48.803
<v Speaker 2>and the book that you've written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just read this week and manual </v>

131
00:06:50.251 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 2>for creating atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

132
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.770
<v Speaker 2>it was wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

133
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.620
<v Speaker 2>it was what I tried to do here actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

134
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.603
<v Speaker 2>which I guess goes to what you said at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top because it was understandable </v>

135
00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:05.001
<v Speaker 2>you were trying to give people the tools</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go about talking about,</v>

136
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasoning and,</v>

137
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.870
<v Speaker 2>and morality without taking the leap of </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith.</v>

138
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

139
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.340
<v Speaker 3>and asking people starts off in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thank you for the,</v>

140
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.840
<v Speaker 3>for the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You enjoyed the book.</v>

141
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 3>I fully did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really did.</v>

142
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.690
<v Speaker 3>And if you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell me.</v>

143
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.471
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

144
00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:22.510
<v Speaker 3>So that's the type of sincerity and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate that.</v>

145
00:07:22.511 --> 00:07:23.344
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the book talks about in the </v>

146
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.420
<v Speaker 3>forthcoming app atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which talks about how to have more civil</v>

147
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.960
<v Speaker 3>productive conversations with people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help them break through dogmatism,</v>

148
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.063
<v Speaker 3>to help them break through these deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>seated beliefs that they hold and that </v>

149
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:42.340
<v Speaker 3>they think that they're better people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they hold these beliefs.</v>

150
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.400
<v Speaker 3>So how to really have productive </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations and engage people.</v>

151
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

152
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.190
<v Speaker 2>So I think the best way to jump off on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is let's just define some terms and</v>

153
00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:51.024
<v Speaker 2>I've done this in one incarnation or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another a few times on the show and </v>

154
00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:56.280
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about religion and atheism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and agnosticism and all that.</v>

155
00:07:56.281 --> 00:07:58.530
<v Speaker 2>But why don't you just give me some </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic definitions,</v>

156
00:07:58.531 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of how you start the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just what is an eighth?</v>

157
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the way I define ads,</v>

158
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are placeholder terms.</v>

159
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:06.944
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to revise those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have an atheist is a person who </v>

160
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have sufficient evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 3>warrant belief in god,</v>

161
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.413
<v Speaker 3>but if they were given that evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they would believe so inherent in </v>

162
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:21.500
<v Speaker 3>the term atheist or the way that I use </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a sort of open mindedness.</v>

163
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is funny to me,</v>

164
00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:23.634
<v Speaker 2>and that's the way you describe it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book because there seems to be a </v>

165
00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:27.174
<v Speaker 2>certain subset of people that think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheists are actually the most closed </v>

166
00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:32.190
<v Speaker 2>minded people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the way you are defining.</v>

167
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.033
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's just sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities that have been publicly </v>

168
00:08:35.461 --> 00:08:36.294
<v Speaker 2>attached to them.</v>

169
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.870
<v Speaker 3>To a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

170
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.213
<v Speaker 3>we can understand why someone would </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that because the word theist is </v>

171
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:42.644
<v Speaker 3>contained with the word atheist and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>as theorists tend to have these dogmas </v>

172
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:47.630
<v Speaker 3>where they latch onto religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>propositions,</v>

173
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.340
<v Speaker 3>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faith promises to faith.</v>

174
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 3>So two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one would think that atheists does.</v>

175
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:53.324
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the faithful have </v>

176
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:56.574
<v Speaker 3>constructed these narratives to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make it as if there's some kind of a </v>

177
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 3>parallelism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assymetry of belief.</v>

178
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we believe these things.</v>

179
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:06.740
<v Speaker 3>You guys believe that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

180
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 3>we have beliefs that are predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 3>no evidence just like you do.</v>

181
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

182
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

183
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a type of insincerity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that people who are honest</v>

184
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 3>with themselves and have a minimal </v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

185
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.503
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically enough intelligence to tie a </v>

186
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 3>shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shoe is,</v>

187
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that it's possible to come</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that conclusion.</v>

188
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

189
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.580
<v Speaker 3>so before we go too deep on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the other,</v>

190
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 3>what are the other terms we should just </v>
<v Speaker 3>define right at the beginning?</v>

191
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.920
<v Speaker 3>So agnosticism for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

192
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

193
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 3>you're not big on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

194
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the term.</v>

195
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.943
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a useless tournament we need to do </v>

196
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 3>away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't believe in santa claus?</v>

197
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.860
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were a santa claus,</v>

198
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 3>a atheist or don't understand to close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agnostic,</v>

199
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.613
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the word agnostic is gives wiggle </v>

200
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 3>room worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wiggle room should exist.</v>

201
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.470
<v Speaker 3>The default to any belief shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the default should probably be no,</v>

202
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 3>unless I have sufficient evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>

203
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 3>But again that's part of the hijacking </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the narrative.</v>

204
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.871
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's interesting.</v>

205
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:13.704
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people I've heard lately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they described themselves as agnostic </v>

206
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.340
<v Speaker 3>atheist.</v>

207
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.173
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be like the new or have </v>
<v Speaker 3>you heard about that one where it gives </v>

208
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess a little more wiggle room,</v>

209
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 3>but you're saying that that in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of cheating the,</v>

210
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 3>the idea here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

211
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe people self described that way</v>

212
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 3>because they feel they want to reap some</v>
<v Speaker 3>social benefits from it.</v>

213
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.993
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they feel that they don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>offend people or insult people or make </v>

214
00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 3>people feel bad so that they use these </v>
<v Speaker 3>wiggle terms.</v>

215
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the book.</v>

216
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:43.791
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first off,</v>

217
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 3>is there anything else we should define?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just real quick.</v>

218
00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

219
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:48.181
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if,</v>

220
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:51.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we've defined something and it's,</v>

221
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's important to define words and those</v>

222
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 3>can be placeholders for later on because</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone says,</v>

223
00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:58.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm an agnostic atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say,</v>

224
00:10:58.561 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 3>well what do you mean by that?</v>

225
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:00.803
<v Speaker 3>And I can challenge or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if not it's like two ships passing </v>

226
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.193
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not like we don't know what the </v>

227
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:05.574
<v Speaker 3>conversation is about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a lot of that in the book </v>

228
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:08.040
<v Speaker 3>where you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

229
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:11.880
<v Speaker 3>people with faith and people without </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith or a nonbeliever verse believer,</v>

230
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:12.714
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however you want to define it there </v>

231
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.653
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about two different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and that sometimes makes the </v>

232
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:20.410
<v Speaker 3>conversation really kinda crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

233
00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:21.244
<v Speaker 3>And that's the problem with faith is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it has a broad semantic range and </v>

234
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 3>people try to use the term to do some </v>
<v Speaker 3>work that it doesn't do,</v>

235
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 3>like they try to use the term to protect</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

236
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.900
<v Speaker 3>well I believe that muhammad fluid </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a winged horse or I believe jesus</v>

237
00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:41.901
<v Speaker 3>walked on water fasting or the dalai </v>
<v Speaker 3>lama incarnates through bodies where it.</v>

238
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just say you have faith,</v>

239
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:45.960
<v Speaker 3>your wife loves you or you have faith in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a plant.</v>

240
00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:46.794
<v Speaker 3>So they use that term as an umbrella </v>
<v Speaker 3>term to almost cover their beliefs from </v>

241
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 3>any make an impervious to reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just don't think that's,</v>

242
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 3>that's a very sincere way to approach </v>
<v Speaker 3>any inquiry.</v>

243
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:01.973
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think a lot of people just from </v>

244
00:12:02.971 --> 00:12:05.280
<v Speaker 2>this first five or six minutes are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

245
00:12:05.281 --> 00:12:05.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

246
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.240
<v Speaker 2>this guy is a pretty open minded atheist</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

247
00:12:09.241 --> 00:12:10.074
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the things you said </v>

248
00:12:11.581 --> 00:12:12.414
<v Speaker 2>right at the beginning of the book is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really define yourself as an </v>

249
00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:15.894
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought you were.</v>

250
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I thought your reasoning was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>really clever.</v>

251
00:12:18.811 --> 00:12:19.644
<v Speaker 2>Can you go into that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you tell me what you got it and </v>

252
00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:23.574
<v Speaker 2>then I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll.</v>

253
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.503
<v Speaker 2>Well basically you were saying I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>define myself as someone that doesn't </v>

254
00:12:25.981 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 2>believe in leprechaun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

255
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

256
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:29.843
<v Speaker 2>but yet there seems to be with atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there seems to be so much onus on them </v>

257
00:12:33.031 --> 00:12:36.060
<v Speaker 2>to constantly have to talk about it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is.</v>

258
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.700
<v Speaker 2>I've only been in this kind of.</v>

259
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I never even publicly said that I was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>

260
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally it was about two months ago,</v>

261
00:12:42.571 --> 00:12:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I think when milo yiannopoulos was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show,</v>

262
00:12:44.371 --> 00:12:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I always considered myself sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of the atheist community.</v>

263
00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I always liked atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like free thinkers.</v>

264
00:12:49.531 --> 00:12:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I like critical thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never,</v>

265
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.300
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't something that really hit me </v>
<v Speaker 2>one way or another.</v>

266
00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like I needed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

267
00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I have to make this announcement or this</v>
<v Speaker 2>announcement.</v>

268
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.720
<v Speaker 2>but somehow in that conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

269
00:13:00.721 --> 00:13:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I had finally got to my breaking point </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

270
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Well that was good then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good car.</v>

271
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.850
<v Speaker 2>So Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all good</v>

272
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.940
<v Speaker 3>honesty though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Public asta.</v>

273
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.390
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that the Word atheist </v>
<v Speaker 3>still has some negative connotations and</v>

274
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.570
<v Speaker 3>a lot of negativity is attached to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

275
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I think that atheism is a conclusion and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ultimately,</v>

276
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:23.260
<v Speaker 3>it's much less important that then </v>
<v Speaker 3>epistomological hygiene if you were like</v>

277
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.150
<v Speaker 3>thinking about how you come to knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 3>and making sure that,</v>

278
00:13:27.151 --> 00:13:27.984
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that those ways to come to knowledge or </v>

279
00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:30.264
<v Speaker 3>reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's the other thing that was </v>

280
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:35.340
<v Speaker 3>a big realization for me a long time ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that that faith,</v>

281
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.730
<v Speaker 3>faith claims are knowledge claims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when someone makes a faith claim,</v>

282
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.180
<v Speaker 3>they're making a claim about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have faith because of x.</v>

283
00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:47.181
<v Speaker 3>So people use faith as a process to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a claim about the world.</v>

284
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole thing is just so </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre twisted,</v>

285
00:13:51.451 --> 00:13:55.950
<v Speaker 3>but unfortunately where we live or it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounded surrounding us,</v>

286
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.500
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have.</v>

287
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.010
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll go to,</v>

288
00:13:59.011 --> 00:13:59.844
<v Speaker 3>I'll speak an atheist conference and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people would be singing about being an </v>

289
00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:03.570
<v Speaker 3>atheist since I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

290
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.680
<v Speaker 3>It's just unfathomable.</v>

291
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.653
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why your description of it </v>

292
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.890
<v Speaker 2>felt decent to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

293
00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.210
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly,</v>

294
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.493
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't talk about it until three </v>

295
00:14:12.981 --> 00:14:13.791
<v Speaker 2>months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never.</v>

296
00:14:13.791 --> 00:14:15.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it will ever be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that defines me.</v>

297
00:14:15.471 --> 00:14:20.471
<v Speaker 2>What defines me are my thoughts and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the breadth of all the things that I am,</v>

298
00:14:20.841 --> 00:14:23.660
<v Speaker 2>but that's just to define yourself by </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying you don't believe in.</v>

299
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Actually it doeSn't make that much </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

300
00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

301
00:14:26.361 --> 00:14:26.810
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

302
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think about defining </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in terms of your thought.</v>

303
00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if I had to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

304
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.703
<v Speaker 3>I think it important to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of person do you want to be </v>

305
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:36.490
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

306
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.260
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a kind person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a compassionate person.</v>

307
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.633
<v Speaker 3>I am very confident that those values </v>
<v Speaker 3>are derived through reason and that we </v>

308
00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:47.990
<v Speaker 3>can articulate ways to get through those</v>
<v Speaker 3>very clearly,</v>

309
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.200
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not Sure if he hit me.</v>

310
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.063
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I want to be tHe type of person </v>

311
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.813
<v Speaker 3>who's willing to revise my beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I want to be the type of person </v>

312
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.330
<v Speaker 3>who's inquisitive and trustful of reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>and who treats people well,</v>

313
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.193
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's the kind of person I want </v>

314
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:05.144
<v Speaker 3>to become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe those things are identify self </v>

315
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 3>identify with those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

316
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 3>It's just an odd thing to me to latch </v>
<v Speaker 3>that onto an identity.</v>

317
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>

318
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.953
<v Speaker 2>I certainly agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of what you're doing in the </v>

319
00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:22.900
<v Speaker 2>book is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you actually use this word is to</v>

320
00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:27.730
<v Speaker 2>deprogram people from faith and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought using that word was particularly</v>

321
00:15:27.731 --> 00:15:30.760
<v Speaker 2>interesting because you're viewing it as</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

322
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all enter this,</v>

323
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.173
<v Speaker 2>this life sort of as a clean slate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're programmed with this stuff </v>

324
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.360
<v Speaker 2>and you're trying to give everyone the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools to,</v>

325
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.770
<v Speaker 2>to deprogram.</v>

326
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly right.</v>

327
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 3>We have been indoctrinated by ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

328
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:47.114
<v Speaker 3>We have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has a kind of cultural myopia </v>

329
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 3>that's reinforced by religion and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beliefs.</v>

330
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.500
<v Speaker 3>So how do we help people to become more </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflective about their beliefs?</v>

331
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 3>How do we help people to become less </v>
<v Speaker 3>dogmatic about what they,</v>

332
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.800
<v Speaker 3>about their thoughts and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

333
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:07.550
<v Speaker 3>maybe maybe that's why like for me even </v>
<v Speaker 3>the is and part of an identity,</v>

334
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:12.551
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that's because it's a dominant</v>
<v Speaker 3>heteronormative or you know,</v>

335
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.180
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

336
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

337
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.173
<v Speaker 3>What I do know is that people think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>havIng certain beliefs makes them a </v>

338
00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:22.304
<v Speaker 3>better person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan debt talks about this in terms of </v>

339
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:27.620
<v Speaker 3>belief and belief and part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem is once you start taking that,</v>

340
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.810
<v Speaker 3>you're holding beliefs makes you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better person.</v>

341
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.823
<v Speaker 3>You're much less likely to revise those </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it moves from the realm of </v>

342
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:37.970
<v Speaker 3>epistemology that is knowledge to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>realm of morals and you don't want to be</v>

343
00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:40.070
<v Speaker 3>that guy like you don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

344
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.961
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

345
00:16:40.961 --> 00:16:41.794
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference between knowledge and </v>

346
00:16:43.031 --> 00:16:43.864
<v Speaker 2>morals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which people seem to conflate </v>

347
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:46.630
<v Speaker 2>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

348
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's interesting in terms of the,</v>

349
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.940
<v Speaker 3>the regressive left and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of race.</v>

350
00:16:53.941 --> 00:16:54.774
<v Speaker 3>When people talk about race that is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>so charged and so politicized that they </v>

351
00:17:00.361 --> 00:17:01.194
<v Speaker 3>have made it almost impossible for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sincere inquirer to ask a question </v>

352
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.340
<v Speaker 3>without being smeared or labeled in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

353
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.473
<v Speaker 3>and we've lost the ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've lost the ability in an academic </v>

354
00:17:14.851 --> 00:17:18.350
<v Speaker 3>context to ask sincere questions that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

355
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.720
<v Speaker 3>The only way to solve any problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first step is to be honest about it.</v>

356
00:17:21.721 --> 00:17:23.730
<v Speaker 3>If you're not honest about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to solve it.</v>

357
00:17:23.731 --> 00:17:24.564
<v Speaker 3>And you've written about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Douglas Murray was on sam's </v>

358
00:17:26.941 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other people have spoken buts.</v>

359
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I've tweeted about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote about this.</v>

360
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.643
<v Speaker 3>If you do not allow questions than </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremists are eager to come in with </v>

361
00:17:37.351 --> 00:17:38.184
<v Speaker 3>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's one of the consequences </v>

362
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.950
<v Speaker 3>that we see and we see this in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious landscape.</v>

363
00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Very it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with islam.</v>

364
00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Now with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see this terrible problem.</v>

365
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>

366
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:51.520
<v Speaker 2>we're jumping ahead a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

367
00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

368
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Follow you on this jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

369
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 2>so when it relates to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the left,</v>

370
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 2>now I assume you're basically someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes from the left,</v>

371
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:00.811
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

372
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 2>from everything I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberal,</v>

373
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.850
<v Speaker 2>liberal class every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every virtually every sense.</v>

374
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I assume that also that you feel the </v>

375
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 2>same way I do that it's your job to </v>
<v Speaker 2>police them more than the.</v>

376
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

377
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people always say to me,</v>

378
00:18:14.431 --> 00:18:15.264
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't you attacking the right as </v>

379
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:16.674
<v Speaker 2>much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like I see I have not part of </v>

380
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:19.950
<v Speaker 2>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do attack them.</v>

381
00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

382
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever voted for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican in my life.</v>

383
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.083
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of the democrats and I'm </v>

384
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:27.990
<v Speaker 2>not a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an independent,</v>

385
00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:30.510
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me to police the people that I'm</v>

386
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:32.070
<v Speaker 2>not part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

387
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just seems silly.</v>

388
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I want to police my guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel that?</v>

389
00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:37.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that part of what you do and</v>

390
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:43.430
<v Speaker 3>I feel to me it's more germane in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense that the left,</v>

391
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 3>the regressives have taken over </v>
<v Speaker 3>academia.</v>

392
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.303
<v Speaker 3>They have literally hijacked the </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions and now they're </v>

393
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.890
<v Speaker 3>institutionalizing these policies which </v>
<v Speaker 3>are really rather extreme by any in any,</v>

394
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.500
<v Speaker 3>any classical liberal would be horrified</v>
<v Speaker 3>at what their speech codes,</v>

395
00:18:58.501 --> 00:18:59.760
<v Speaker 3>microaggressions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Troy,</v>

396
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.623
<v Speaker 3>it's horrifying and they're Basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>robbing a generation of people have the </v>

397
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:05.574
<v Speaker 3>possibility of being able to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly and critically and their ever </v>

398
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.713
<v Speaker 3>increasing the threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People's threshold for what they </v>

399
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:13.164
<v Speaker 3>consider to be offensive or the types of</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations they'll have is </v>

400
00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:16.644
<v Speaker 3>continuously dropping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me it's personal only and then I </v>

401
00:19:19.321 --> 00:19:22.500
<v Speaker 3>have to deal with this every single day </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I write.</v>

402
00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:24.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the most personal thing.</v>

403
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

404
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.990
<v Speaker 3>it's endemic now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

405
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you criticize the rightest </v>
<v Speaker 3>much?</v>

406
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.401
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

407
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:31.560
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have criticized the right,</v>

408
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:32.394
<v Speaker 3>you've criticized the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about the type of criticism you </v>

409
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:38.310
<v Speaker 3>have to label against a guy who is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bonafide.</v>

410
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Can I start?</v>

411
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 2>We're on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your shows were away.</v>

412
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone always asked me before they </v>

413
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.040
<v Speaker 2>swear I probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably asked me for a while.</v>

414
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.913
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

415
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean think of,</v>

416
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.420
<v Speaker 3>think about about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

417
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.610
<v Speaker 3>like huckabee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is a bonafide fucking lunatic,</v>

418
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:51.863
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about guys like Donald </v>

419
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these guys are so outside,</v>

420
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.610
<v Speaker 3>not even actually that's status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not outside the mainstream or at</v>

421
00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:01.590
<v Speaker 3>least have that place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

422
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.573
<v Speaker 3>And labeling a sort of criticism against</v>
<v Speaker 3>that type of crazy is very different </v>

423
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.430
<v Speaker 3>from people for whom I feel sympathies </v>
<v Speaker 3>for these impulses they have.</v>

424
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.993
<v Speaker 3>They have very decent impulses that base</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we need to be careful that because </v>

425
00:20:20.431 --> 00:20:24.340
<v Speaker 3>they're so insincere and dishonest that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't disregard their whole message.</v>

426
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Like the onus falls upon us to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly about that,</v>

427
00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 3>into really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay privilege,</v>

428
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:32.490
<v Speaker 3>I got it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

429
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.590
<v Speaker 3>this gender thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

430
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:35.483
<v Speaker 3>but to really take a step back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>separate the message from the messenger </v>

431
00:20:38.881 --> 00:20:40.500
<v Speaker 3>so that we don't discount the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

432
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

433
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.600
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very aware of that all the time,</v>

434
00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:44.434
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know that I'm attacking the </v>

435
00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:48.580
<v Speaker 2>trigger warnings and safe space and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff and I don't want to throw the</v>

436
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:49.414
<v Speaker 2>baby out with the bathwater and I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are legitimate racial issues </v>

437
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:55.510
<v Speaker 2>in early legitimate socioeconomic issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that stuff.</v>

438
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 2>But because of the way these guys have </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaved and frame the debate,</v>

439
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:03.730
<v Speaker 2>they've made it extremely difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate legitimate issues.</v>

440
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.400
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From pure craziness.</v>

441
00:21:06.401 --> 00:21:10.270
<v Speaker 2>So I think what's interesting related to</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like you that comes from a place</v>

442
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.900
<v Speaker 2>where you're writing and talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral clarity and and critical thinking,</v>

443
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.890
<v Speaker 2>this has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like doubly worse for you in</v>

444
00:21:17.891 --> 00:21:20.070
<v Speaker 2>a way to be part of this because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

445
00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.080
<v Speaker 2>there's the thinking part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spiritual part.</v>

446
00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just a lot mixed into one </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy thing.</v>

447
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

448
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:28.144
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had I think nicola here and other </v>

449
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:34.810
<v Speaker 3>people have given geological accounts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>how we got into the situation,</v>

450
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:35.644
<v Speaker 3>but I think the thing that people really</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't thinking about or talking about </v>

451
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:41.770
<v Speaker 3>that much or what are the implications </v>
<v Speaker 3>for these things.</v>

452
00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the philosophical.</v>

453
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 3>What does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did this would interest.</v>

454
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.090
<v Speaker 3>We're both speaking quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have so much to sacrifice,</v>

455
00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.453
<v Speaker 3>so much to get up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does this mean when we've created </v>

456
00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:58.111
<v Speaker 3>academic environments in which people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>which professors are terrified to give a</v>

457
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:01.400
<v Speaker 3>dissenting opinion and then when </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissenting.</v>

458
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean something from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the regressive party line.</v>

459
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.250
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean</v>

460
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.293
<v Speaker 2>for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's define dissenting because it's </v>

461
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:09.394
<v Speaker 2>barely dissenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's literally just saying anything </v>

462
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.403
<v Speaker 2>other descending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're saying something </v>

463
00:22:13.871 --> 00:22:15.880
<v Speaker 2>that's really against what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream belief is.</v>

464
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.160
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much anything like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

465
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.850
<v Speaker 2>be okay with someone else wearing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>halloween costume that you may not like.</v>

466
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 2>ThAt's the tour sort of dissenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

467
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.550
<v Speaker 3>And that's the kind of craziness that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get when you.</v>

468
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.663
<v Speaker 3>So it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the issue of how we got there is </v>

469
00:22:31.621 --> 00:22:33.840
<v Speaker 3>extremely interesting and valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

470
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:39.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in recently my work has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been focusing on what does that mean for</v>

471
00:22:39.121 --> 00:22:39.954
<v Speaker 3>one's intellectual life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what does that mean for one's </v>

472
00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:46.650
<v Speaker 3>ability to reflect on issues?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean for one's ability to</v>

473
00:22:46.651 --> 00:22:48.900
<v Speaker 3>make decisions about things that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter?</v>

474
00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Not halloween costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that some people think that</v>

475
00:22:52.081 --> 00:22:55.110
<v Speaker 3>matters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just evidence of an inability</v>

476
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.820
<v Speaker 3>to show moral triage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

477
00:22:56.821 --> 00:22:57.654
<v Speaker 3>to prior to indexically partners prior </v>
<v Speaker 3>to some kind of a hierarchy to identify </v>

478
00:23:01.951 --> 00:23:06.600
<v Speaker 3>that one need and another need and show </v>
<v Speaker 3>why that's important.</v>

479
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.560
<v Speaker 3>And the way that you do that is through </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason and rationality.</v>

480
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.440
<v Speaker 3>That's how you get there and the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you.</v>

481
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.130
<v Speaker 3>So when you attack safe spaces and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you attract trick,</v>

482
00:23:17.131 --> 00:23:18.750
<v Speaker 3>true warnings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually,</v>

483
00:23:18.751 --> 00:23:19.584
<v Speaker 3>this is the key thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually doing them a favor </v>

484
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.673
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're giving them an </v>

485
00:23:24.331 --> 00:23:25.164
<v Speaker 3>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're giving people an opportunity if </v>

486
00:23:27.511 --> 00:23:28.344
<v Speaker 3>their values are true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if their values are morally </v>

487
00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:31.920
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

488
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.753
<v Speaker 3>And I do believe that there's such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing as being morally correct and </v>

489
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.740
<v Speaker 3>obviously they do as well or they </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't be espousing.</v>

490
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.833
<v Speaker 3>And that's just parenthetically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the interesting difference </v>

491
00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.670
<v Speaker 3>between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

492
00:23:44.671 --> 00:23:45.504
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the contradiction in their beliefs </v>

493
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:51.470
<v Speaker 3>between being lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My train of thought.</v>

494
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.423
<v Speaker 3>Well that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're going that they think </v>

495
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

496
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.250
<v Speaker 3>So right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

497
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you.</v>

498
00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.200
<v Speaker 3>So these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the legacy of relativism,</v>

499
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:05.150
<v Speaker 3>but yet the values that they put forth a</v>
<v Speaker 3>radical egalitarianism,</v>

500
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.930
<v Speaker 3>you cannot be a relativist entity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Galitary and safe.</v>

501
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.270
<v Speaker 3>You cannot say everything is relative </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then all systems are equal.</v>

502
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.810
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing,</v>

503
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.673
<v Speaker 3>they'll look at it as to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I will look at it as to advance </v>

504
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:22.610
<v Speaker 3>their cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you're doing is you're</v>

505
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:27.611
<v Speaker 3>giving people an opportunity to reflect </v>
<v Speaker 3>on how they know what they know,</v>

506
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 3>and the only way you can do that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>through an unsafe space.</v>

507
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.453
<v Speaker 3>The only way you can do that Is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>really take a look at these ideas and </v>

508
00:24:37.701 --> 00:24:40.490
<v Speaker 3>examined these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There just is no other way.</v>

509
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.443
<v Speaker 3>So if they have their values are </v>
<v Speaker 3>arbitrary and subject to cultural </v>

510
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:47.024
<v Speaker 3>capriciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless they can be rationally derived </v>

511
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:50.953
<v Speaker 3>and they've taken out the engine of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationality once they've created spaces </v>

512
00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.830
<v Speaker 3>in which you can ask these questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

513
00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:02.780
<v Speaker 3>so that's why I've a few times I'll say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the road to hell is paved with good</v>

514
00:25:02.781 --> 00:25:05.360
<v Speaker 3>intentions that I believed that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

515
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.493
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe rogan fought me on this when I said </v>

516
00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:08.031
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

517
00:25:08.031 --> 00:25:08.864
<v Speaker 3>I believe these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with the athletic thing on real </v>

518
00:25:10.571 --> 00:25:14.180
<v Speaker 3>time with sam harris and all that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while his intentions were good.</v>

519
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.313
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was intending to try to protect the </v>

520
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:19.700
<v Speaker 3>other joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically it was like,</v>

521
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:20.790
<v Speaker 3>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a hollywood guy.</v>

522
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.930
<v Speaker 3>He's just protecting her zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his own internals and actor.</v>

523
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.280
<v Speaker 3>He's an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it and he's,</v>

524
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.323
<v Speaker 3>he's out for number one fund,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess that's probably what really </v>

525
00:25:29.931 --> 00:25:33.830
<v Speaker 3>is perverse about what's going on on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left because by taking kids,</v>

526
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:34.664
<v Speaker 3>by taking college kids whose thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't fully formulated yet and then </v>

527
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.613
<v Speaker 3>putting this thing on them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think they're doing everything for </v>

528
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:42.764
<v Speaker 3>good intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they're going to walk out into </v>

529
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 3>the world realizing the world doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really react that way.</v>

530
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:48.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if they're listening to this and </v>

531
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.870
<v Speaker 3>they're just dumping on you and hate you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hate in me,</v>

532
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.033
<v Speaker 3>I think it's perhaps a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful heuristic to think about it in </v>

533
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:00.530
<v Speaker 3>terms of standing for the flag.</v>

534
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.693
<v Speaker 3>An example on the rIght,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the right are big on respect </v>

535
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 3>for the flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've made their own thing sacred,</v>

536
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.693
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's important is to teach </v>

537
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:15.680
<v Speaker 3>people why they should stand for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flag,</v>

538
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.700
<v Speaker 3>what our values mean and and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're standing.</v>

539
00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:23.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not an icon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that the same property holds</v>

540
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.430
<v Speaker 3>on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to.</v>

541
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:26.983
<v Speaker 3>They have to start being honest and </v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing that if their values really </v>

542
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:31.874
<v Speaker 3>are true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they have to subject those values </v>

543
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:36.380
<v Speaker 3>to scrutiny and then we have to create </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaces.</v>

544
00:26:36.381 --> 00:26:41.381
<v Speaker 3>we have to create environments where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>marketplace of ideas,</v>

545
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.330
<v Speaker 3>we can have a discourse and a dialectic </v>
<v Speaker 3>above these things.</v>

546
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's just a little different,</v>

547
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:50.910
<v Speaker 3>we just do the do the officers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they should be thankIng you.</v>

548
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:51.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

549
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm being facetious.</v>

550
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:53.543
<v Speaker 3>I'm being really sincere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they should be thanking you </v>

551
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 3>because if not then that means their </v>
<v Speaker 3>values are arbitrary.</v>

552
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 3>So when I talked about this with milo </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the and the college thing,</v>

553
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:02.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that what this really is about,</v>

554
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:03.654
<v Speaker 3>this isn't about left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying that thIs really is about </v>

555
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:05.964
<v Speaker 3>authoritarians versus the word of </v>
<v Speaker 3>porsche and that's what you're really </v>

556
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:11.130
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the horseshoe.</v>

557
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:11.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

558
00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.723
<v Speaker 3>so somehow though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is related to religion to </v>

559
00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:15.924
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can relate this very much to </v>

560
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.510
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thinking of religion.</v>

561
00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 3>So can you go down that path for me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit?</v>

562
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:21.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

563
00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 3>they use many of the same mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have things that are sacred.</v>

564
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.030
<v Speaker 3>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the rise of the victim,</v>

565
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:29.940
<v Speaker 3>the victim hood culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have certain questions,</v>

566
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:30.774
<v Speaker 3>certain ideas can't be questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't be challenged to churches or safe </v>

567
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:35.820
<v Speaker 3>space to university campuses are safe </v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

568
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.880
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so here's what's super interesting.</v>

569
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.310
<v Speaker 3>When I did a talk a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

570
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.270
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five years,</v>

571
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know it's on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

572
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 3>the easter bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And other delusions just say no.</v>

573
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know if you saw that or not,</v>

574
00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:50.064
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

575
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Speaker 3>but the people who protested that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>not chrIstians,</v>

576
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I had some christians come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the audience,</v>

577
00:27:56.161 --> 00:27:56.994
<v Speaker 3>I speak all around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are in general with very few </v>

578
00:27:59.791 --> 00:28:02.850
<v Speaker 3>exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians and muslims are very civil to</v>

579
00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:04.860
<v Speaker 3>christians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go out for beer off afterwards,</v>

580
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's the regressive leftist who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>

581
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean really think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

582
00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.970
<v Speaker 3>this is like the feminist is rice said </v>
<v Speaker 3>to joe today.</v>

583
00:28:12.971 --> 00:28:15.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like the feminists in bed with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>islamists,</v>

584
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.493
<v Speaker 3>I mean is you just could not conceive of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a relationship that was more eight to </v>

585
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.110
<v Speaker 3>thetical t two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

586
00:28:22.111 --> 00:28:24.240
<v Speaker 3>one of those parties interests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

587
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.950
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's interesting that,</v>

588
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.380
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm pretty sure that the,</v>

589
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.870
<v Speaker 3>the islamic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

590
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.823
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're never going to treat these </v>

591
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.850
<v Speaker 3>women any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

592
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is that?</v>

593
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.220
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to cut you off,</v>

594
00:28:35.221 --> 00:28:36.054
<v Speaker 3>but what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

595
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 3>what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they just view.</v>

596
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.203
<v Speaker 3>So these feminists for whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just view the other as more </v>

597
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:44.304
<v Speaker 3>oppressive than they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they just have to give them their </v>

598
00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 3>credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

599
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.063
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really that simple and that is a </v>

600
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.880
<v Speaker 3>comp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have thought about that a long time.</v>

601
00:28:50.881 --> 00:28:54.750
<v Speaker 3>I think it deals with the color of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's skin oppression.</v>

602
00:28:54.751 --> 00:28:56.870
<v Speaker 3>I think it deals with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

603
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.510
<v Speaker 3>this whole third wave feminism that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>still don't understand.</v>

604
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:01.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

605
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

606
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot explain to you,</v>

607
00:29:05.641 --> 00:29:10.270
<v Speaker 3>and I've thought about it extensively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how this cohabitation fine,</v>

608
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.070
<v Speaker 3>not a marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how,</v>

609
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:12.923
<v Speaker 3>how this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how this bizarre relationship came to </v>

610
00:29:17.911 --> 00:29:18.030
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

611
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:18.863
<v Speaker 3>I still cannot understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the most recent event at goldsmiths </v>

612
00:29:21.511 --> 00:29:24.270
<v Speaker 3>dot dawkins was tweeting on and such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is,</v>

613
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.680
<v Speaker 3>that should be a case study for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

614
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.060
<v Speaker 3>that is even boggling my mind to even </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about trying to understand that.</v>

615
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then so that and,</v>

616
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.550
<v Speaker 3>and all of this and all the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about in this discussion,</v>

617
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.880
<v Speaker 3>it shows again why that if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>help the reformers,</v>

618
00:29:43.901 --> 00:29:44.734
<v Speaker 3>the actual reformers who are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change make things better for women and </v>

619
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:48.244
<v Speaker 3>gays and might not even question if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't help these people and you keep </v>

620
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:52.870
<v Speaker 3>framing these people as the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what do you,</v>

621
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:54.070
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get the rise of trump?</v>

622
00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:54.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

623
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to say that extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think my treat was something like a,</v>

624
00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:01.630
<v Speaker 3>if you have create environments in which</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can ask questions,</v>

625
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.550
<v Speaker 3>extremist step in with solutions.</v>

626
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.650
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could this,</v>

627
00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:08.030
<v Speaker 3>so really could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that this atmosphere that,</v>

628
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:12.300
<v Speaker 3>that trump has taken advantage of their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their sense of palpable fear,</v>

629
00:30:12.301 --> 00:30:14.620
<v Speaker 3>right in America that I haven't felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

630
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:15.783
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sense that people are feeling like </v>

631
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.100
<v Speaker 3>everything is screwed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's,</v>

632
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.200
<v Speaker 3>we have this terrorism stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what the answers are.</v>

633
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.213
<v Speaker 3>There's this refugee thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all children of refugees are </v>

634
00:30:26.471 --> 00:30:27.304
<v Speaker 3>descendants of refugees here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you came over as a slave or a </v>

635
00:30:30.611 --> 00:30:31.870
<v Speaker 3>american indian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

636
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.240
<v Speaker 3>If you were actually indigenous to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>

637
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.313
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just had this sense that people </v>

638
00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:37.594
<v Speaker 3>don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when you shut down the people </v>

639
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:40.630
<v Speaker 3>on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zach,</v>

640
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 3>then of course trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

641
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.013
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I really wish that every single </v>

642
00:30:46.271 --> 00:30:50.380
<v Speaker 3>person listening to that would put the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rewind button and listen to that again.</v>

643
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.483
<v Speaker 3>So if you're one of these people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinks that you're doing the world a </v>

644
00:30:54.731 --> 00:30:56.470
<v Speaker 3>favor by creating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

645
00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.860
<v Speaker 3>triggering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting people who are,</v>

646
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to protect the sensitivities of</v>

647
00:31:01.481 --> 00:31:01.931
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

648
00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:02.764
<v Speaker 3>not a bad impulse at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the consequence of that is that </v>

649
00:31:05.681 --> 00:31:09.040
<v Speaker 3>people become less capable of making </v>
<v Speaker 3>discerning,</v>

650
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 3>rational judgements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in the moral sphere.</v>

651
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.273
<v Speaker 3>So the consequence of those things is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Donald Trump is right there with </v>

652
00:31:16.121 --> 00:31:18.870
<v Speaker 3>the answer and I just read a piece about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of people who,</v>

653
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.060
<v Speaker 3>who support trump who won't admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is far higher,</v>

654
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.703
<v Speaker 3>which is terrifying and we know that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way we don't want to create adversarial </v>

655
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:29.830
<v Speaker 3>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if so,</v>

656
00:31:29.831 --> 00:31:32.950
<v Speaker 3>I think that part of this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go down this rabbit hole</v>

657
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:33.784
<v Speaker 3>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but part of this problem is we have to </v>

658
00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:37.870
<v Speaker 3>engage trump's arguments on his own </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>

659
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.063
<v Speaker 3>And part of that is if the idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is going to make America </v>

660
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:43.840
<v Speaker 3>safer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what we should.</v>

661
00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:46.330
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't appeal to patriotism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we should take a look at that.</v>

662
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.193
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that claim is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's borne out by the </v>

663
00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:49.763
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any reason to </v>

664
00:31:50.651 --> 00:31:52.930
<v Speaker 3>think that first off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even constitutional.</v>

665
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Any of the keeping people out based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion or we can accept.</v>

666
00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.190
<v Speaker 3>We can just bracket that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

667
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 3>and we can just look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

668
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.220
<v Speaker 3>what is the consequences of this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

669
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.660
<v Speaker 3>what is the concept?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

670
00:32:04.661 --> 00:32:05.494
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what is the content you think that </v>

671
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:08.650
<v Speaker 3>muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muslim,</v>

672
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.780
<v Speaker 3>islamic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's again,</v>

673
00:32:10.781 --> 00:32:13.070
<v Speaker 3>so we need to figure that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting caught in words.</v>

674
00:32:13.071 --> 00:32:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Even this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the crazy thing?</v>

675
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.393
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've made us also crazy about words </v>

676
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.030
<v Speaker 3>that whatever you were about to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

677
00:32:19.031 --> 00:32:20.920
<v Speaker 3>you had to think about it 18 different </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

678
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.753
<v Speaker 3>Even though you're sitting across from </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody that you know is okay with the </v>

679
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.590
<v Speaker 3>idea of what you're going to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

680
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 3>I was caught because I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okaY,</v>

681
00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:30.940
<v Speaker 3>well we should have defined the term </v>
<v Speaker 3>islam is the religion,</v>

682
00:32:30.941 --> 00:32:31.774
<v Speaker 3>the belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideas that so and mostly from the </v>

683
00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:35.104
<v Speaker 3>people of the people and it for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason that seems to be an unbelievably </v>

684
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.980
<v Speaker 3>too way too complicated for people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

685
00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't understAnd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you think that is?</v>

686
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:43.484
<v Speaker 3>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it also seems like they can only do </v>

687
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:45.674
<v Speaker 3>that with islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the issue only seems to be with </v>

688
00:32:47.781 --> 00:32:50.780
<v Speaker 3>islam because if we were to say anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>about christianity,</v>

689
00:32:50.781 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 3>people would be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great job.</v>

690
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.923
<v Speaker 3>You're awesome all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if you say anything about radical </v>

691
00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:57.861
<v Speaker 3>islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>

692
00:32:57.861 --> 00:32:59.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crusades,</v>

693
00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.670
<v Speaker 3>which is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that.</v>

694
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.570
<v Speaker 3>So you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

695
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.310
<v Speaker 3>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's.</v>

696
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Remember I said the values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hold her egalitarianism,</v>

697
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.940
<v Speaker 3>relativism for them in their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Egalitarianism.</v>

698
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.370
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every age has had a dominating value.</v>

699
00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:16.550
<v Speaker 3>In aristotle he talks about the and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen in homer.</v>

700
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:21.260
<v Speaker 3>It was strengthened little tara was </v>
<v Speaker 3>humor and now it's,</v>

701
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:23.780
<v Speaker 3>it's in one side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's egalitarianism in relatives.</v>

702
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.500
<v Speaker 3>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything has to be relative.</v>

703
00:33:25.501 --> 00:33:26.300
<v Speaker 3>It'S like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

704
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.133
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

705
00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.100
<v Speaker 3>usually the default is relativistic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>andy galatarian.</v>

706
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.970
<v Speaker 3>So while they have their band guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have your bad guys.</v>

707
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.863
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually those things are not morally </v>

708
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:41.490
<v Speaker 3>equivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

709
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:46.250
<v Speaker 3>so you're asking the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a pertinent and it's one that should</v>

710
00:33:46.251 --> 00:33:48.020
<v Speaker 3>be explored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that about?</v>

711
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.960
<v Speaker 3>I think part of it is that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>extended the,</v>

712
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:56.290
<v Speaker 3>the umbrella of rights a wider and wider</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I want to be crystal clear that I'm,</v>

713
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm being descriptive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not evaluative.</v>

714
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm describing the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's good or bad,</v>

715
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just at a restaurant with my buddy</v>

716
00:34:06.021 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 3>there before we came here and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat,</v>

717
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to eat only cruelty free meat so I</v>

718
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:12.263
<v Speaker 3>won't eat that's school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've now extended the umbrella of </v>

719
00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:15.650
<v Speaker 3>rights to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to animals,</v>

720
00:34:15.651 --> 00:34:17.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that is constantly extending.</v>

721
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:21.770
<v Speaker 3>So the next step for some people is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>extend that to ideas.</v>

722
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:23.950
<v Speaker 3>We've extended that and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I.</v>

723
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

724
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.210
<v Speaker 3>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

725
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.560
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

726
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.393
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to throw it again in that for a </v>

727
00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:31.550
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've extended the ideas of rights,</v>

728
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:35.240
<v Speaker 3>which used to be for people now to </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals because we want to treat animals</v>

729
00:34:35.241 --> 00:34:36.270
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Minority.</v>

730
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:40.430
<v Speaker 3>The next version of that will be with </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

731
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 3>So we're going sorta take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to put on even softer gloves</v>

732
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:47.870
<v Speaker 3>and when it comes to ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because even that should be held in some</v>

733
00:34:47.871 --> 00:34:48.110
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

734
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people,</v>

735
00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:51.620
<v Speaker 3>as I said in my tam talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas don't deserve dignity.</v>

736
00:34:51.621 --> 00:34:53.230
<v Speaker 3>People do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's kind of become a meme,</v>

737
00:34:53.231 --> 00:34:54.064
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

738
00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:58.190
<v Speaker 3>it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the next kind of radical.</v>

739
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Taking that idea and extending it </v>
<v Speaker 3>further on,</v>

740
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.593
<v Speaker 3>and the problem with that is that you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>a disservice to those people holding </v>

741
00:35:05.661 --> 00:35:09.170
<v Speaker 3>beliefs because you don't respect their </v>
<v Speaker 3>beliefs to engage them enough.</v>

742
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Let's do the thing that's really not </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about.</v>

743
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.850
<v Speaker 3>This whole enterprise is really one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrespect that they're.</v>

744
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.150
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to engender these values </v>
<v Speaker 3>of respect but not listening to people,</v>

745
00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Speaker 3>not engaging people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's ideas.</v>

746
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.251
<v Speaker 3>Even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

747
00:35:25.251 --> 00:35:28.340
<v Speaker 3>you've talked about your show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the soft bigotry of low expectations.</v>

748
00:35:28.341 --> 00:35:31.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it was bush bushes phrase and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>kept crediting bill maher,</v>

749
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:34.550
<v Speaker 3>which at least sounded nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm quoting George W.</v>

750
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

751
00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.570
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

752
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

753
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.710
<v Speaker 3>So then you'll be an con,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

754
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's going to gang up on us </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're going to say,</v>

755
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:42.084
<v Speaker 3>look at you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're really love bush deep in your </v>

756
00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:43.860
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

757
00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually not true.</v>

758
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.223
<v Speaker 3>That's just a fabrication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of mental gymnastics </v>

759
00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:52.470
<v Speaker 3>people need to do to keep their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological biases in place.</v>

760
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that was one of the things,</v>

761
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:54.834
<v Speaker 3>you know when we launched the show in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to sam was the first guest and he </v>

762
00:35:57.121 --> 00:36:00.570
<v Speaker 3>said that they're always looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these people are always looking for</v>

763
00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:01.404
<v Speaker 3>something in you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that you've said this opinion or </v>

764
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:05.094
<v Speaker 3>that you've shared this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they can somehow link together </v>

765
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.360
<v Speaker 3>something that gets them to where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want you to be,</v>

766
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:13.980
<v Speaker 3>you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

767
00:36:13.981 --> 00:36:16.620
<v Speaker 3>and just thInk about this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

768
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Think about discharging that impulse </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have.</v>

769
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Think about the kind of person that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

770
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.773
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult for me to say without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without being overly harsh and as soon </v>

771
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:36.900
<v Speaker 3>as example of a time when someone ought </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be overly harsh,</v>

772
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 3>but that makes me feel really sad for </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

773
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:40.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's.</v>

774
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.633
<v Speaker 3>That's very much how I feel I had out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this because like I could barely </v>

775
00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:46.104
<v Speaker 3>speak what I'm saying because this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this situation has cost me friends and </v>

776
00:36:49.321 --> 00:36:50.154
<v Speaker 3>relationships already and I've only been</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about this stuff for a couple </v>

777
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.040
<v Speaker 3>months and so I see the way people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned on me and I,</v>

778
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.660
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten into big debates with </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and said,</v>

779
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.530
<v Speaker 3>can you point me to where I said what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're accusing me?</v>

780
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.620
<v Speaker 3>And they never do because they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thAt's that.</v>

781
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if I may ask you,</v>

782
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.510
<v Speaker 3>what is the point of contention you </v>
<v Speaker 3>lost?</v>

783
00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:11.643
<v Speaker 3>Was that an issue?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it a sweet one who exists in the </v>

784
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:15.240
<v Speaker 3>world that we exist in?</v>

785
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.710
<v Speaker 3>That's public person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

786
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.573
<v Speaker 3>who I no longer talk to anymore who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been a good friend of mine for the last </v>

787
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.393
<v Speaker 3>couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that my whole show now is about </v>

788
00:37:21.811 --> 00:37:22.644
<v Speaker 3>bigotry to muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said it's actually the complete </v>

789
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:27.323
<v Speaker 3>route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to separate people from the </v>

790
00:37:29.911 --> 00:37:34.260
<v Speaker 3>ideology and trying to show that not </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone believes this.</v>

791
00:37:34.261 --> 00:37:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I brought on people repeatedly to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about tolerance.</v>

792
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they'll frame,</v>

793
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.150
<v Speaker 3>they'll say sam and majid that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

794
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.090
<v Speaker 3>that these are the bigots they're book </v>
<v Speaker 3>was called.</v>

795
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.170
<v Speaker 3>It was about islam and the future of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerance,</v>

796
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.840
<v Speaker 3>not islam in the future of nuclear war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

797
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.140
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's these mental gymnastics as you just</v>

798
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.430
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what would that person lIke you to do</v>

799
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.480
<v Speaker 3>not talk about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose not talk about these important</v>

800
00:37:57.481 --> 00:37:58.314
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

801
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.300
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

802
00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:01.134
<v Speaker 3>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that goes back to what we started the </v>

803
00:38:02.941 --> 00:38:03.840
<v Speaker 3>conversation with them.</v>

804
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.580
<v Speaker 3>That's why you get trump's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

805
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.660
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>SO I don't,</v>

806
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.553
<v Speaker 3>I would ask them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of the feasibility test </v>

807
00:38:09.811 --> 00:38:12.300
<v Speaker 3>that I talk about in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the app haS the feasibility tests.</v>

808
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.343
<v Speaker 3>It's under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What conditions do you think that that </v>

809
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:16.170
<v Speaker 3>belief would be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>False.</v>

810
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.180
<v Speaker 3>You can leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be religion.</v>

811
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:20.040
<v Speaker 3>You can use the usability tests is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>my idea.</v>

812
00:38:20.041 --> 00:38:20.874
<v Speaker 3>It's matt mccormick's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can use the usability tests with </v>

813
00:38:22.831 --> 00:38:23.664
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So under what conditions could I </v>

814
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.880
<v Speaker 3>demonstrate to you that I am not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>biased against muslims hydro?</v>

815
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.380
<v Speaker 3>If they say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

816
00:38:31.381 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 3>there are no conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's a type of belief closure.</v>

817
00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:35.424
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's,</v>

818
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there almost is no conversation.</v>

819
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.510
<v Speaker 3>then you have to take a step back and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate to say this,</v>

820
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 3>but to the metal level and have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation about that.</v>

821
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

822
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 3>but I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

823
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:48.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm kind of ideating.</v>

824
00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:50.650
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm concerned about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendship with this person.</v>

825
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've given up basically because once,</v>

826
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 3>because after being called a bigot </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly and saying,</v>

827
00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:56.831
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

828
00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:59.200
<v Speaker 3>and can you point me to any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know I'm not a big,</v>

829
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

830
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.950
<v Speaker 3>Douglas Murray said something really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting on sam's podcast.</v>

831
00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:03.784
<v Speaker 3>He Said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no time anymore for people whose </v>

832
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:08.440
<v Speaker 3>intentions are not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

833
00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:09.274
<v Speaker 3>So I know I'm not a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you want to call me a racist or </v>

834
00:39:11.651 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 3>call me a bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually,</v>

835
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.560
<v Speaker 3>since I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually,</v>

836
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't like being called a racist or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigot,</v>

837
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't really have any meaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's just a word.</v>

838
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 3>If I was secretly racist and you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling me a racist,</v>

839
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:24.460
<v Speaker 3>I suppose I would struggle with it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit more,</v>

840
00:39:24.461 --> 00:39:28.000
<v Speaker 3>but so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the hard thing about,</v>

841
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.863
<v Speaker 3>that's that really is difficult about </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with people who are insincere </v>

842
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.660
<v Speaker 3>and I think a lot of those attacks on </v>
<v Speaker 3>sam,</v>

843
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.513
<v Speaker 3>like in philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing called a hermaneutic of </v>

844
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:36.514
<v Speaker 3>charity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to give everybody a charitable </v>

845
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.490
<v Speaker 3>reputation and you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

846
00:39:39.491 --> 00:39:41.740
<v Speaker 3>these guys actually believe this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

847
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:45.190
<v Speaker 3>but over time you just have to grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

848
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

849
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

850
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 3>and I don't hate to say this because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

851
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.540
<v Speaker 3>I should have woken up to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion long ago.</v>

852
00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't think these people are sincere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

853
00:39:57.881 --> 00:40:00.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's hard to grasp too.</v>

854
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.730
<v Speaker 3>It is hard to grasp because if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought they had the truth,</v>

855
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.580
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't they be sincere?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

856
00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.680
<v Speaker 3>So excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

857
00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:12.740
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing thAt kind of keePs me </v>
<v Speaker 3>from going on a full throttle attack.</v>

858
00:40:12.821 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the,</v>

859
00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:19.590
<v Speaker 3>their cognitive software has somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>been hijacked by this moral.</v>

860
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.730
<v Speaker 3>This idea that they think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>defending the downtrodden and we,</v>

861
00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:27.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to do this as an examPle.</v>

862
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:29.800
<v Speaker 3>It's okay to do this because we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>stripping some,</v>

863
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some utilitarian calculus,</v>

864
00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:32.801
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

865
00:40:32.801 --> 00:40:33.634
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be in the greater goods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what goes through their </v>

866
00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the problem with dealing with</v>

867
00:40:37.901 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 3>someone who's insincere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

868
00:40:39.371 --> 00:40:42.610
<v Speaker 3>So I do think that I think that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

869
00:40:42.611 --> 00:40:44.740
<v Speaker 3>and maybe I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably giving them the,</v>

870
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.320
<v Speaker 3>the leash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they wouldn't afford me.</v>

871
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.393
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I do think they think as much as </v>

872
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.360
<v Speaker 3>said he thought he said they think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were in a war.</v>

873
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 3>So they're gonna use whatever tactics </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have.</v>

874
00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:55.773
<v Speaker 3>What I find particularly odd about it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that now that we live in a digital age </v>

875
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.870
<v Speaker 3>where everything is recorded and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be quoted,</v>

876
00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:02.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to this person about this or </v>

877
00:41:03.881 --> 00:41:07.820
<v Speaker 3>this person about that even when they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>confronted with new evidence or frontier</v>

878
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:11.350
<v Speaker 3>or exposed as frauds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just doubled down even more,</v>

879
00:41:11.351 --> 00:41:13.460
<v Speaker 3>which is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

880
00:41:13.461 --> 00:41:14.294
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I share your frustration and I'm </v>

881
00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:18.970
<v Speaker 3>sympathetic with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

882
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.981
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

883
00:41:19.981 --> 00:41:20.814
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

884
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm a hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

885
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.120
<v Speaker 3>I'd call your friend again and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>

886
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's have a talk.</v>

887
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.863
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't let that friendship go </v>

888
00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:31.960
<v Speaker 3>because that's not like trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to sit down.</v>

889
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.740
<v Speaker 3>We did this over text.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't even,</v>

890
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't even sit to even say let's</v>
<v Speaker 3>get coffee.</v>

891
00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.140
<v Speaker 3>that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the regressive left.</v>

892
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to have conversations.</v>

893
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.290
<v Speaker 3>They want to end those conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ironically they turn that against us</v>

894
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:46.124
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

895
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.040
<v Speaker 3>you guys are the ones who don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have conversations.</v>

896
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:52.010
<v Speaker 3>And I look the whole prompt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the schism and liberalism,</v>

897
00:41:52.011 --> 00:41:52.844
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was made can naked on the bill </v>

898
00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:59.921
<v Speaker 3>maher show with ben affleck and sam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is something again,</v>

899
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:02.180
<v Speaker 3>to solve these problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to be on it.</v>

900
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 3>We need to be forthright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to be honest.</v>

901
00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.433
<v Speaker 3>We need to create environments where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can talk about the problems and almost </v>

902
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.580
<v Speaker 3>if you were to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

903
00:42:10.581 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Speaker 3>create a list of how not to solve your </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

904
00:42:12.471 --> 00:42:13.550
<v Speaker 3>These people have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

905
00:42:13.551 --> 00:42:14.050
<v Speaker 3>they've done it.</v>

906
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Perfect job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

907
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.130
<v Speaker 3>what's amazing to me also is that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>never mean to go this deep into it even.</v>

908
00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.230
<v Speaker 3>I really wanted to focus more on </v>
<v Speaker 3>atheism.</v>

909
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy I'm.</v>

910
00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go there now and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy to do this,</v>

911
00:42:24.471 --> 00:42:25.304
<v Speaker 3>but what I think is particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating about this is that </v>

912
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:28.603
<v Speaker 3>everything else that we talk about and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're going to talk about is so </v>

913
00:42:31.641 --> 00:42:33.160
<v Speaker 3>related to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why this,</v>

914
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.033
<v Speaker 3>this whole situation has been so bananas</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this schism has exposed </v>

915
00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:41.600
<v Speaker 3>something that I think people didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really realize.</v>

916
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 3>But let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just leave that portion there.</v>

917
00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.580
<v Speaker 3>Unless you want to give me a closing </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement on that and then we'll take it</v>

918
00:42:46.581 --> 00:42:47.361
<v Speaker 3>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

919
00:42:47.361 --> 00:42:49.610
<v Speaker 3>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that we.</v>

920
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.280
<v Speaker 3>This is not a very hopeful time right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

921
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.143
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're dealing with very serious </v>

922
00:42:54.351 --> 00:42:59.351
<v Speaker 3>ecological issues and we have people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are apologists for big oil companies and</v>

923
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.930
<v Speaker 3>denialists and end of anthropogenic </v>
<v Speaker 3>global warming.</v>

924
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:04.363
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually do think those people should </v>

925
00:43:06.201 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 3>be given a seat at the adult table and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody who has a view different from my</v>

926
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:11.114
<v Speaker 3>own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as they provide evidence is </v>

927
00:43:12.081 --> 00:43:12.914
<v Speaker 3>welcomed to have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's something that's </v>

928
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.740
<v Speaker 3>morally damaging about what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>regresses are doing.</v>

929
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.030
<v Speaker 3>And I think people have had enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have had way more than enough.</v>

930
00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.980
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think now like your,</v>

931
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:29.873
<v Speaker 3>your show has really caused this </v>
<v Speaker 3>catalyst almost this cascade of people </v>

932
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.090
<v Speaker 3>who also feel the same way and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

933
00:43:38.091 --> 00:43:38.924
<v Speaker 3>mines are gravitating and they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've really robbed us of any idea of </v>

934
00:43:43.461 --> 00:43:47.620
<v Speaker 3>hope that we have because we look at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential campaign and I,</v>

935
00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.340
<v Speaker 3>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy moly.</v>

936
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at the republicans and I think,</v>

937
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.940
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like any one of those people would be an</v>

938
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.070
<v Speaker 3>unmitigated disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

939
00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.030
<v Speaker 3>and this is this.</v>

940
00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:00.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>

941
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:01.520
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just gonna keep going with this,</v>

942
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:01.811
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

943
00:44:01.811 --> 00:44:02.041
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

944
00:44:02.041 --> 00:44:02.874
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

945
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:03.833
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just keep going because you're </v>

946
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:06.420
<v Speaker 3>hitting on it that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

947
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.980
<v Speaker 3>this thing is so it's so powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I watched the republican debates</v>

948
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:17.420
<v Speaker 3>and I think I could never in good </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscience vote for all you people.</v>

949
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.770
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now part of,</v>

950
00:44:18.771 --> 00:44:21.680
<v Speaker 3>there is a piece of me that when I see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there,</v>

951
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.500
<v Speaker 3>this regressive group when they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all like bernie.</v>

952
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a piece of me that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I like the same guy they like,</v>

953
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:29.750
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy because I do like him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

954
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 3>But that's how perverse this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

955
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.680
<v Speaker 3>That's why we have to make sure that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>separate the message from the messenger.</v>

956
00:44:35.681 --> 00:44:36.514
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why it's so difficult to do </v>

957
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:41.280
<v Speaker 3>that when you're constantly smeared.</v>

958
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.620
<v Speaker 3>If you use the wrong pronoun by accent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

959
00:44:43.621 --> 00:44:45.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm 49.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been growing up calling.</v>

960
00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:45.781
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

961
00:44:45.781 --> 00:44:46.614
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

962
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not mal intent.</v>

963
00:44:48.641 --> 00:44:49.474
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have some deep moral malignancy </v>

964
00:44:51.061 --> 00:44:52.230
<v Speaker 3>in me that I'm kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

965
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:56.640
<v Speaker 3>it's like I made a fucking mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we have,</v>

966
00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:57.893
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have been there so morally right all </v>

967
00:44:59.191 --> 00:45:00.360
<v Speaker 3>the time too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

968
00:45:00.361 --> 00:45:01.194
<v Speaker 3>There's so they're always policing </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone else's words as if they have </v>

969
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.960
<v Speaker 3>high gna of ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

970
00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.730
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the genius about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

971
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll do the atheism thing.</v>

972
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy though because I do want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep going with this because I feel each</v>

973
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:15.954
<v Speaker 3>week I feel like I can get away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>this a little bit and then something </v>

974
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:20.430
<v Speaker 3>else happens that brings me back into </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

975
00:45:20.431 --> 00:45:22.470
<v Speaker 3>And we've talked about it in a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>more of a lofty way,</v>

976
00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 3>which is nice.</v>

977
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 3>AlSo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so much the nitty gritty of it,</v>

978
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:27.750
<v Speaker 3>but in this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in sort of a bigger sense.</v>

979
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.010
<v Speaker 3>But uh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

980
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get to somebody,</v>

981
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.640
<v Speaker 3>and this is all going to relate back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

982
00:45:32.641 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want to know about new atheists.</v>

983
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:35.203
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an attack on new atheist as I </v>

984
00:45:37.771 --> 00:45:38.604
<v Speaker 3>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New atheist pretty much are just </v>

985
00:45:40.861 --> 00:45:43.650
<v Speaker 3>atheists who are finally speaking up </v>
<v Speaker 3>about atheism.</v>

986
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.570
<v Speaker 3>It may be a little more you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you define it.</v>

987
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:47.460
<v Speaker 3>I think a little more specifically write</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the book.</v>

988
00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:48.294
<v Speaker 3>There's a little more about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're actually trying to shoot down </v>

989
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:51.924
<v Speaker 3>some ideas where an old atheist maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>just removed themselves from the </v>

990
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that fair?</v>

991
00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean different people define it </v>

992
00:45:58.261 --> 00:45:59.190
<v Speaker 3>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Austin,</v>

993
00:45:59.191 --> 00:46:00.024
<v Speaker 3>dc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people think there's no difference </v>

994
00:46:01.201 --> 00:46:02.850
<v Speaker 3>between new and the old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

995
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I do think there is a difference.</v>

996
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.303
<v Speaker 3>I think there a little more kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>forthright in their speech and people </v>

997
00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:11.760
<v Speaker 3>interpret being forthright as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrespectful,</v>

998
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:14.760
<v Speaker 3>overly aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a mischaracterization.</v>

999
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:20.150
<v Speaker 3>I think that they've made this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the additional move from the,</v>

1000
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:21.303
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this set of beliefs or this suite of </v>

1001
00:46:22.831 --> 00:46:27.150
<v Speaker 3>beliefs is irrational to these beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 3>are delusional.</v>

1002
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:31.050
<v Speaker 3>And I think from my work delusion has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been a component of,</v>

1003
00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:35.430
<v Speaker 3>of how I think it's helpful to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the problem and uh,</v>

1004
00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.740
<v Speaker 3>but they don't take too kindly to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The believer,</v>

1005
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:39.623
<v Speaker 3>the believer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the average believer and you say you're </v>

1006
00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:43.900
<v Speaker 3>delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're usually not that responsive.</v>

1007
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:44.833
<v Speaker 3>If you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't read the book because you </v>

1008
00:46:46.561 --> 00:46:47.394
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to invoke a defensive </v>

1009
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:49.464
<v Speaker 3>posture and something that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>enter into a conversation in which </v>

1010
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.320
<v Speaker 3>people change their bullies from point </v>
<v Speaker 3>of view of safety,</v>

1011
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.910
<v Speaker 3>so this is literally what you do in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>

1012
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:57.743
<v Speaker 3>I mean you lay out the exact tools on </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you should talk design by line word </v>

1013
00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:06.870
<v Speaker 3>for word as a template that you can use </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people have gone around.</v>

1014
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.150
<v Speaker 3>One anthonY,</v>
<v Speaker 3>magna,</v>

1015
00:47:09.151 --> 00:47:13.760
<v Speaker 3>bosco has gone around videos on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 3>who implements the uses,</v>

1016
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.860
<v Speaker 3>the scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What iS your confIdence in this belief?</v>

1017
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Gives an intervention based upon the </v>
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>

1018
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:22.110
<v Speaker 3>Now what is your internet post-test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretest intervention post stuff,</v>

1019
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:23.873
<v Speaker 3>and it's amazing that the down moves </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people make and only five to 10 </v>

1020
00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:28.830
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know that this works.</v>

1021
00:47:28.831 --> 00:47:33.370
<v Speaker 3>We that this is effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that these sorts of very civil,</v>

1022
00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 3>very engaging and that's the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1023
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:36.184
<v Speaker 3>you never have to worry about anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying they don't want to talk about </v>

1024
00:47:37.961 --> 00:47:39.010
<v Speaker 3>their faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody loves.</v>

1025
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.240
<v Speaker 3>that's the one thing that people will </v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

1026
00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:43.010
<v Speaker 3>The one commonality among people of </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith.</v>

1027
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 3>They love to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So speaking of talking about it,</v>

1028
00:47:45.521 --> 00:47:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you also hit upon how people</v>

1029
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.300
<v Speaker 2>are very selective in what they believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you get them to admit,</v>

1030
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:55.720
<v Speaker 2>well I don't believe that a this or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

1031
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:56.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe some heart,</v>

1032
00:47:56.771 --> 00:47:57.604
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about chopping off hands are tied to </v>

1033
00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.123
<v Speaker 2>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1034
00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.390
<v Speaker 2>that's the crazy part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I believe in this other stuff.</v>

1035
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:04.780
<v Speaker 2>But I think what you were saying is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically if you can get them to sort of</v>

1036
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.033
<v Speaker 2>started meeting something not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of how you pull the string </v>

1037
00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:12.330
<v Speaker 2>right to then leading to getting them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>admit some other stuff probably.</v>

1038
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:13.263
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in a lot of that is you have to </v>

1039
00:48:14.951 --> 00:48:17.920
<v Speaker 3>create conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1040
00:48:17.921 --> 00:48:20.380
<v Speaker 3>this isn't me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a long body of literature.</v>

1041
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:23.980
<v Speaker 3>There's a long line of literature about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to change the behavior of people who</v>

1042
00:48:23.981 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 3>don't want their behavior change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's from drug and alcohol counseling.</v>

1043
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:27.810
<v Speaker 3>It's from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1044
00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 3>motivational interviewing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cult exiting.</v>

1045
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.950
<v Speaker 3>This is out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nobody is really synthesized it.</v>

1046
00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's brought these disparate </v>
<v Speaker 3>elements together.</v>

1047
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:36.933
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1048
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 2>I was partly thinking this when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the book,</v>

1049
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:39.904
<v Speaker 2>what would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say is the problem if </v>

1050
00:48:41.711 --> 00:48:42.544
<v Speaker 2>there's the average person that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>believer that uses religion for </v>

1051
00:48:46.511 --> 00:48:48.250
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1052
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.010
<v Speaker 2>celebrate some holidays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the religion might be,</v>

1053
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't doing anything,</v>

1054
00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:54.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1055
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:55.623
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the people that are beheading </v>

1056
00:48:56.081 --> 00:48:56.914
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're just some average person </v>

1057
00:48:58.031 --> 00:48:59.650
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't necessarily take your faith</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>

1058
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 2>but you get some sense of community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

1059
00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.660
<v Speaker 2>do you see an inherent problem in that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is that just for you?</v>

1060
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:05.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1061
00:49:05.591 --> 00:49:07.980
<v Speaker 2>you're just sort of diluted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but alright,</v>

1062
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:08.830
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go with it.</v>

1063
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:09.663
<v Speaker 3>I do see a problem because I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are wasting their life energy on </v>

1064
00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:16.024
<v Speaker 3>something that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are harboring of belief about </v>

1065
00:49:18.911 --> 00:49:19.744
<v Speaker 3>reality that is almost definitely false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we just know this empirically </v>

1066
00:49:23.051 --> 00:49:23.884
<v Speaker 3>because of the number of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>religions that make different claims </v>

1067
00:49:26.351 --> 00:49:27.880
<v Speaker 3>about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't all be right.</v>

1068
00:49:27.881 --> 00:49:29.000
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are contradictions.</v>

1069
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Perfect one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jesus was crucified.</v>

1070
00:49:31.181 --> 00:49:33.010
<v Speaker 3>Jesus was not crucified islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>

1071
00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:36.550
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed was the last prophet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>muhammad was a prophet for mormons.</v>

1072
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.780
<v Speaker 3>So people are harboring views about </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality that are true.</v>

1073
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:45.450
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is I've heard people say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a lot and I have to challenge.</v>

1074
00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.930
<v Speaker 3>I have to push back with you on </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1075
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:50.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure that people can hold a </v>
<v Speaker 3>private belief.</v>

1076
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:58.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure that somebody can have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>belief and had not had that belief bleed</v>

1077
00:49:58.431 --> 00:49:59.470
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interaction.</v>

1078
00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:00.623
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

1079
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily base speaking it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just by the way they are.</v>

1080
00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Can you give me an</v>

1081
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:06.281
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that,</v>

1082
00:50:06.281 --> 00:50:09.380
<v Speaker 3>that's what it means to hold a belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say so.</v>

1083
00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like people.</v>

1084
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's to charge so many users.</v>

1085
00:50:14.651 --> 00:50:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Your blazer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't like guys who.</v>

1086
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:21.170
<v Speaker 3>This is a nice blazer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're brooks brothers.</v>

1087
00:50:21.171 --> 00:50:22.004
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to make that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like guys who have brooks boilers but </v>

1088
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:25.940
<v Speaker 3>like if I can't stand the smell </v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

1089
00:50:25.941 --> 00:50:26.691
<v Speaker 3>they look different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1090
00:50:26.691 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not gonna.</v>

1091
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna let that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to show that.</v>

1092
00:50:29.811 --> 00:50:30.644
<v Speaker 3>Like if I meet some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can work with someone who has a </v>

1093
00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 3>blazer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

1094
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:34.543
<v Speaker 3>I think what it means that that's almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>a denial of what it means to have a </v>

1095
00:50:38.871 --> 00:50:41.870
<v Speaker 3>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hold a belief about something so,</v>

1096
00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:42.853
<v Speaker 3>so I'm also not sure that these beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 3>are as benign as people think that they </v>

1097
00:50:46.581 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every time I bring that up,</v>

1098
00:50:48.141 --> 00:50:49.310
<v Speaker 3>people will bring out a study.</v>

1099
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.890
<v Speaker 3>Well look at this like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1100
00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:55.780
<v Speaker 3>religiosity in this group correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The smart people will say correlated.</v>

1101
00:50:55.781 --> 00:50:59.060
<v Speaker 3>The less intellectually adjoined people </v>
<v Speaker 3>will say,</v>

1102
00:50:59.061 --> 00:51:02.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some causal correlated,</v>

1103
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:03.710
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1104
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.753
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge difference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's just go with it a look what </v>

1105
00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:08.864
<v Speaker 3>happened to you have religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have lower incidence of heart </v>

1106
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:11.654
<v Speaker 3>disease or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the word you used before </v>

1107
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:15.440
<v Speaker 3>was apt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's community.</v>

1108
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Those benefits can be found from </v>
<v Speaker 3>community and you can get communities of</v>

1109
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:24.140
<v Speaker 3>likeminded people without believing any </v>
<v Speaker 3>superstitious silliness.</v>

1110
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.370
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get,</v>

1111
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:28.840
<v Speaker 3>you can get like the same sports team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1112
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.060
<v Speaker 3>he has a community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.390
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that you say,</v>

1114
00:51:32.391 --> 00:51:33.224
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the harm of someone rooting for </v>

1115
00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:37.010
<v Speaker 3>the patriots?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about football.</v>

1116
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:38.810
<v Speaker 3>What's the harm of someone rooting for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the patriots?</v>

1117
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1118
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.433
<v Speaker 3>that that's this analogous because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not claiming that it's objective </v>

1119
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:43.520
<v Speaker 3>lee.</v>

1120
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1121
00:51:45.141 --> 00:51:45.974
<v Speaker 3>And so if I think that the patriots are </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordained by god to win the superbowl or </v>

1122
00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:52.460
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1123
00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.220
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about sports.</v>

1124
00:51:54.221 --> 00:51:54.851
<v Speaker 3>So thought was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1125
00:51:54.851 --> 00:51:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Linda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks super bowl.</v>

1126
00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.760
<v Speaker 3>They'll take me down that road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I travel,</v>

1127
00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:59.900
<v Speaker 3>then I get 50 hate mails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People love football.</v>

1128
00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1129
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:02.083
<v Speaker 3>so I think that the problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people make objective claims and they </v>

1130
00:52:06.351 --> 00:52:10.760
<v Speaker 3>live their lives accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is all you got,</v>

1131
00:52:10.761 --> 00:52:13.250
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zach just said,</v>

1132
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:14.323
<v Speaker 3>so wouldn't it be better for those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to be invited to see reality for </v>

1133
00:52:19.851 --> 00:52:20.684
<v Speaker 3>what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't it be better to give those </v>

1134
00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:26.060
<v Speaker 3>people an opportunity to flourish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if your beliefs,</v>

1135
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:27.583
<v Speaker 3>if one belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you can look at it as like an </v>

1136
00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:32.270
<v Speaker 3>architect tonic struggling like a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>building,</v>

1137
00:52:32.271 --> 00:52:33.104
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If one of your beliefs on the bottom </v>

1138
00:52:34.521 --> 00:52:38.780
<v Speaker 3>level of that building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's contaminated like a base belief,</v>

1139
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:39.614
<v Speaker 3>like jesus rose from the dead order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all of the beliefs that flow from </v>

1140
00:52:44.121 --> 00:52:46.610
<v Speaker 3>that are stemmed from that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspect.</v>

1141
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>

1142
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:49.363
<v Speaker 3>So what's the harm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The harm is that if you want to enaBle </v>

1143
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:54.980
<v Speaker 3>yourself to flourish and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>enable your community to flourish,</v>

1144
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.370
<v Speaker 3>you have to align your beliefs with </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality because if you don't,</v>

1145
00:52:58.780 --> 00:52:59.613
<v Speaker 3>then what you think is objective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moral of the right thing to do will </v>

1146
00:53:03.321 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 3>actually be leading you away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>flourishing.</v>

1147
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.321
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's interesting.</v>

1148
00:53:06.321 --> 00:53:07.154
<v Speaker 3>So almost in a way you then systemically</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to constantly be compromising </v>

1149
00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:15.620
<v Speaker 3>because no matter how much new evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes in to prove something else,</v>

1150
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:19.130
<v Speaker 3>you really have to skirt around it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you built sort of your,</v>

1151
00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.520
<v Speaker 3>your base in things that aren't true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1152
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:23.810
<v Speaker 3>and you put your finger on the cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1153
00:53:23.811 --> 00:53:27.930
<v Speaker 3>The cognitive problem is then in order </v>
<v Speaker 3>to reconcile that,</v>

1154
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:31.410
<v Speaker 3>they make a virtue out of not revising </v>
<v Speaker 3>their beliefs.</v>

1155
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:34.950
<v Speaker 3>they make a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you need to import new words,</v>

1156
00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.880
<v Speaker 3>words that have words that are anathema </v>
<v Speaker 3>to belief,</v>

1157
00:53:38.881 --> 00:53:39.714
<v Speaker 3>revision like sin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sacred and that buttresses or </v>

1158
00:53:43.111 --> 00:53:46.080
<v Speaker 3>protects those beliefs from being </v>
<v Speaker 3>revised.</v>

1159
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:47.123
<v Speaker 3>So there's a whole mechanism to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>this that almost like I talked about in </v>

1160
00:53:51.991 --> 00:53:52.824
<v Speaker 3>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1161
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:53.873
<v Speaker 3>It's almost if you look at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>epidemiologically how these things </v>

1162
00:53:57.391 --> 00:53:58.470
<v Speaker 3>spread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like memes.</v>

1163
00:53:58.471 --> 00:54:02.760
<v Speaker 3>They spread the medically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you really think about that,</v>

1164
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:04.103
<v Speaker 3>the harm is that literally billions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are living in ways that they </v>

1165
00:54:09.241 --> 00:54:10.074
<v Speaker 3>think is just and kind and right and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not and nation states are created </v>

1166
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.073
<v Speaker 3>around that and we're in a very serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with technology and the </v>

1167
00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:23.430
<v Speaker 3>instantaneous flow of an access of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1168
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 3>We are in a problem that we can no </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer afford.</v>

1169
00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:28.740
<v Speaker 3>Not only to ignore that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to disallow.</v>

1170
00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:29.643
<v Speaker 3>There we go the rest of leftist ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to disallow conversations about </v>

1171
00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:34.074
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We look a shocking number of people in </v>

1172
00:54:38.251 --> 00:54:40.740
<v Speaker 3>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm ashamed to say this,</v>

1173
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:42.960
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't Shoot the messenger.</v>

1174
00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:47.520
<v Speaker 3>Do not want muslim immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to target people and not their</v>

1175
00:54:47.521 --> 00:54:50.700
<v Speaker 3>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to have a talk about that,</v>

1176
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:54.930
<v Speaker 3>ignoring that is not only not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it go away,</v>

1177
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:56.093
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to make that percentage </v>
<v Speaker 3>increase and that's the thing that the </v>

1178
00:54:59.161 --> 00:55:01.680
<v Speaker 3>regressives just cannot seem to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that.</v>

1179
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:04.340
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course we're back to no,</v>

1180
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.890
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the but the point being that.</v>

1181
00:55:06.891 --> 00:55:11.150
<v Speaker 2>so then if you were to take someone like</v>
<v Speaker 2>sam who's having extremely difficult,</v>

1182
00:55:11.151 --> 00:55:16.151
<v Speaker 2>complex thought out conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between islam and muslims</v>

1183
00:55:16.491 --> 00:55:18.380
<v Speaker 2>and islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>islam and jihad and all those things,</v>

1184
00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:21.290
<v Speaker 2>and if you put him in the same bank as </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

1185
00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:24.080
<v Speaker 2>there is nobody left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that for me exactly,</v>

1186
00:55:24.081 --> 00:55:24.914
<v Speaker 2>that for me is why I've taken this so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've taken this thing on because I </v>

1187
00:55:28.281 --> 00:55:29.114
<v Speaker 2>saw this guy who I told sam to his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know who he was before </v>

1188
00:55:32.091 --> 00:55:32.750
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1189
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:33.461
<v Speaker 2>Believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1190
00:55:33.461 --> 00:55:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't reallY know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't follow them on twitter.</v>

1191
00:55:35.301 --> 00:55:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I had never read any of his books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had maybe heard of him,</v>

1192
00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.830
<v Speaker 2>but I watched that thing and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jeSus,</v>

1193
00:55:39.831 --> 00:55:40.664
<v Speaker 2>here's a guy trying to tell the truth on</v>
<v Speaker 2>some pretty controversial things and </v>

1194
00:55:43.851 --> 00:55:45.110
<v Speaker 2>look at the way he's beIng the</v>

1195
00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:46.293
<v Speaker 3>even trying to ask questions and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's so interesting and that's what </v>

1196
00:55:50.051 --> 00:55:52.720
<v Speaker 3>you moral look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's complicated.</v>

1197
00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:53.853
<v Speaker 3>Moral arguments are just complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you have guys very smart </v>

1198
00:55:58.031 --> 00:55:58.864
<v Speaker 3>individuals who have substantive </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreements about eating animals </v>

1199
00:56:02.081 --> 00:56:02.914
<v Speaker 3>factory from this is complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's more reason and not less </v>

1200
00:56:06.791 --> 00:56:07.624
<v Speaker 3>reason to talk about it and what they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>done to sam is that they have created </v>

1201
00:56:11.291 --> 00:56:15.100
<v Speaker 3>conditions to make it impossible for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to speak.</v>

1202
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:19.390
<v Speaker 3>They have really done exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite of what they.</v>

1203
00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:22.990
<v Speaker 2>The danger of what's going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges really,</v>

1204
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.760
<v Speaker 2>because you were usIng.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam is one example of this,</v>

1205
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:26.853
<v Speaker 2>but if they can breathe that ideology in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the colleges now it goes to what you </v>

1206
00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:30.754
<v Speaker 2>were saying before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You worry about the future because now </v>

1207
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:34.720
<v Speaker 2>you're going to bring up all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people with all this idea.</v>

1208
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:39.130
<v Speaker 2>So it was some of this though that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have these conversations.</v>

1209
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.270
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1210
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:41.133
<v Speaker 2>we view things on vine in six seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>140 characters and I'm really happy to </v>

1211
00:56:45.161 --> 00:56:45.994
<v Speaker 2>be doing long form again and I really do</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that it's coming back and I get </v>

1212
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:51.640
<v Speaker 2>emails every day saying that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>digging it so we're on to something,</v>

1213
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:52.743
<v Speaker 2>but it's part of it that to have real </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions about real things and </v>

1214
00:56:58.061 --> 00:56:58.894
<v Speaker 2>especially when you take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do it from the religious angle </v>

1215
00:57:00.471 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 2>and and atheism and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1216
00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:03.603
<v Speaker 2>you're basically bill maher and dawkins </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a couple oTher people that are </v>

1217
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:07.564
<v Speaker 2>really in the limelight of it and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're putting too much on a few people </v>

1218
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.793
<v Speaker 2>and that's sort of the reverse of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>this should go if you want to have real </v>

1219
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 2>open discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1220
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.780
<v Speaker 3>Putting a lot on a few people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aaron,</v>

1222
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.000
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry to,</v>

1223
00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:23.110
<v Speaker 2>but for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people always.</v>

1224
00:57:23.111 --> 00:57:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll defend bill maher in related to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and people say,</v>

1225
00:57:26.231 --> 00:57:27.064
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a dick about it and he's throwing </v>

1226
00:57:28.811 --> 00:57:31.000
<v Speaker 2>it in everyone's face and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And although we say,</v>

1227
00:57:31.001 --> 00:57:34.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grant him a leash on this because he's</v>

1228
00:57:34.391 --> 00:57:36.340
<v Speaker 2>fighting the good fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>

1229
00:57:36.341 --> 00:57:37.174
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting thing that's so hard to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really using reason to explain </v>

1230
00:57:40.421 --> 00:57:43.030
<v Speaker 2>complex things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have to,</v>

1231
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:45.660
<v Speaker 2>if he's a little bit of a dick about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1232
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.963
<v Speaker 2>It's guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of dicks or the other </v>

1233
00:57:48.011 --> 00:57:48.844
<v Speaker 2>side too.</v>

1234
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:50.390
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1235
00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:54.270
<v Speaker 3>I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>afflecks respect clip was just perfect.</v>

1236
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Afflecks response was so implematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't know if rogan's right.</v>

1237
00:57:58.591 --> 00:58:00.570
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea if this guy is such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good actor.</v>

1238
00:58:00.571 --> 00:58:01.890
<v Speaker 3>He had us all believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

1239
00:58:01.891 --> 00:58:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1240
00:58:03.031 --> 00:58:03.864
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do know is that that reaction is </v>

1241
00:58:06.511 --> 00:58:09.750
<v Speaker 3>more typical than ever now and we need </v>
<v Speaker 3>less of that reaction.</v>

1242
00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Here's one way that we may want to think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about getting less of that reaction.</v>

1243
00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.160
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not being facetious when I say </v>
<v Speaker 3>is an incredibly sincere.</v>

1244
00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:20.760
<v Speaker 3>virtually every time I speak to some and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not every time,</v>

1245
00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:21.653
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a professional apologist and </v>

1246
00:58:22.681 --> 00:58:25.800
<v Speaker 3>that goes out the window virtually every</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1247
00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.360
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm speaking with someone,</v>

1248
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I always think to myself maybe they know</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1249
00:58:30.481 --> 00:58:35.481
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you can just attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold that in your head in.</v>

1250
00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.800
<v Speaker 3>I have found in conversations with </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious people,</v>

1251
00:58:40.801 --> 00:58:44.160
<v Speaker 3>it's been very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will admit to you,</v>

1252
00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:45.053
<v Speaker 3>I almost cannot do that any longer with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the regressives because because they </v>

1253
00:58:49.531 --> 00:58:53.190
<v Speaker 3>make a slip of the tongue into some </v>
<v Speaker 3>monstrous,</v>

1254
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.950
<v Speaker 3>heinous act or I always feel that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal.</v>

1255
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.770
<v Speaker 3>Like it's deeply personal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something,</v>

1256
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:03.743
<v Speaker 3>there's something in me that they need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to cleanse or something like there's </v>

1257
00:59:07.111 --> 00:59:08.720
<v Speaker 3>some kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's what I mean</v>

1258
00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:09.573
<v Speaker 2>about the authority or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're in a weird way they're </v>

1259
00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 2>doing religious trickery.</v>

1260
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:14.070
<v Speaker 3>They are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1261
00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:14.943
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1262
00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.810
<v Speaker 3>The horseshoe they're buying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:19.760
<v Speaker 3>they're using a lot of the tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question is like,</v>

1264
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:22.940
<v Speaker 3>what do we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we engage these people?</v>

1265
00:59:22.941 --> 00:59:26.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a very difficult question.</v>

1266
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Particularly when they now have at their</v>
<v Speaker 3>disposal.</v>

1267
00:59:30.861 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 3>They've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've infested academia,</v>

1268
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:34.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do we do in these people now </v>

1269
00:59:36.081 --> 00:59:37.190
<v Speaker 3>the rule makers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1270
00:59:37.191 --> 00:59:40.340
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that the more I try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring this towards atheism,</v>

1271
00:59:40.341 --> 00:59:44.270
<v Speaker 3>the more it comes back to this because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that they're there at the</v>

1272
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:45.104
<v Speaker 3>attacks that they've done on the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>atheists where they use it as a </v>

1273
00:59:46.941 --> 00:59:48.800
<v Speaker 3>pejorative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you're a new atheist.</v>

1274
00:59:48.801 --> 00:59:51.580
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of some sort of evil creature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though I don't know many.</v>

1275
00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anyone really that </v>
<v Speaker 3>identifies as a new atheist as a,</v>

1276
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:56.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't think maybe sam does.</v>

1277
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even sure.</v>

1278
00:59:57.810 --> 00:59:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1279
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.193
<v Speaker 3>but they've just muddied the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were just saying you don't identify </v>

1280
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:03.710
<v Speaker 3>as an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1281
01:00:03.711 --> 01:00:05.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can attempt to smear me.</v>

1282
01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:06.044
<v Speaker 3>You can attempt to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the irony is joe and I talked about </v>

1283
01:00:08.431 --> 01:00:09.264
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I have never heard a person </v>

1284
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:13.460
<v Speaker 3>used the word intersectional who wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a nasty,</v>

1285
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.330
<v Speaker 3>who wasn't just a really just mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirited,</v>

1286
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.040
<v Speaker 3>angry person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1287
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:20.650
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1288
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:21.523
<v Speaker 3>and I think that is part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I should be indignant because </v>

1289
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:26.204
<v Speaker 3>I'm a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good people become indignant at these </v>

1290
01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:28.994
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1291
01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.860
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1292
01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.170
<v Speaker 3>we're going to talk about atheism or </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go back.</v>

1293
01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fine.</v>

1294
01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:36.230
<v Speaker 3>We're Going to do what kind of chart </v>
<v Speaker 3>could we do on this?</v>

1295
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready to back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1296
01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:39.170
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're going with me.</v>

1297
01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:44.350
<v Speaker 3>So I think part of the problem is also </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when people have made the choice to</v>

1298
01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:46.520
<v Speaker 3>make the leap of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1299
01:00:46.521 --> 01:00:50.090
<v Speaker 3>whatever the religion that they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>jumped in in a certain way,</v>

1300
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:51.343
<v Speaker 3>even though I think in their eyes </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing something very lofty and </v>

1301
01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:55.070
<v Speaker 3>in a certain way you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just.</v>

1302
01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:57.980
<v Speaker 3>I view it as sort of like you're giving </v>
<v Speaker 3>up sort of your like this.</v>

1303
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.823
<v Speaker 3>The world is a pretty fucked up place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer so I'm just </v>

1304
01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.940
<v Speaker 3>going to leap and just hope that this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that,</v>

1305
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.060
<v Speaker 3>is that part of why it makes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rational person's argument to them?</v>

1306
01:01:08.061 --> 01:01:08.894
<v Speaker 3>Very difficult because there you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're arguing against something that's </v>

1307
01:01:11.421 --> 01:01:15.290
<v Speaker 3>not rational in its most pure form that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1308
01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Did I get somewhere there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1309
01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:17.903
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only because I think different people </v>

1310
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:25.230
<v Speaker 3>believe for different reasons and so.</v>

1311
01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:26.900
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1312
01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:27.943
<v Speaker 3>here's what I do know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unlike this belief that seems to be out </v>

1313
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:33.770
<v Speaker 3>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be going around,</v>

1314
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.500
<v Speaker 3>you can actually reason people on an </v>
<v Speaker 3>audit of unreasonable positions.</v>

1315
01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:38.490
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking to my.</v>

1316
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:41.180
<v Speaker 3>My buddy that's a couple of days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>john w dot loftis.</v>

1317
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.373
<v Speaker 3>I wrote the forward to his new book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a disciple of the greatest </v>

1318
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.660
<v Speaker 3>christian apologist senator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He reasoned,</v>

1319
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:50.540
<v Speaker 3>so jerry [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>the list goes on and on and on of people</v>

1320
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:55.541
<v Speaker 3>who have done that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it doesn't start with reason</v>

1321
01:01:56.121 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 3>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It starts with honesty.</v>

1322
01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:02.780
<v Speaker 3>You really think there was a talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>snake like no bullshit like you think,</v>

1323
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:03.883
<v Speaker 3>but yet if you looked at your garden and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're raking up and a snake started </v>

1324
01:02:06.711 --> 01:02:07.910
<v Speaker 3>talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be freaking out,</v>

1325
01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:08.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1326
01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:09.780
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I.</v>

1327
01:02:09.781 --> 01:02:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would believe you and no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>would believe you.</v>

1328
01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:12.644
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>so these things cohere in a very </v>

1329
01:02:14.391 --> 01:02:16.970
<v Speaker 3>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to use a big word,</v>

1330
01:02:16.971 --> 01:02:19.740
<v Speaker 3>but covariance set of beliefs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforced our beliefs,</v>

1331
01:02:19.741 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

1332
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.290
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think that there's.</v>

1333
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.490
<v Speaker 2>We can narrow it down to one note or one</v>
<v Speaker 2>data point for why people believe.</v>

1334
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very complex equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1335
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:29.551
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

1336
01:02:29.551 --> 01:02:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I haven't thought of this so literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>until just this second,</v>

1337
01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:34.980
<v Speaker 2>but years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in 1997,</v>

1338
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.083
<v Speaker 2>so I was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Egypt and I was at mount </v>

1339
01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:39.414
<v Speaker 2>sinai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is supposedly where moses got the </v>

1340
01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 2>10 commandments and I hiked up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain.</v>

1341
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:45.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a long hike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to do it at night.</v>

1342
01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I did it during the day I ran out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

1343
01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:47.964
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was basically delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My stomach was messed up from apes and </v>

1344
01:02:50.671 --> 01:02:52.340
<v Speaker 2>bad pigeon in cairo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was.</v>

1345
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.333
<v Speaker 2>If I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was ever a moment where I was </v>

1346
01:02:54.181 --> 01:02:55.014
<v Speaker 2>gonna have a spiritual awakening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's where it was because I was </v>

1347
01:02:56.911 --> 01:02:58.950
<v Speaker 2>compromised in my body.</v>

1348
01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember not getting it all.</v>

1349
01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:01.794
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember going to the top of that </v>

1350
01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 2>thing and thinking like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's something here,</v>

1351
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:07.890
<v Speaker 2>you got to give me a sign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1352
01:03:07.891 --> 01:03:08.724
<v Speaker 2>Like if there's something here and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is where moses supposedly saw the </v>

1353
01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 2>burning bush and got the 10 commandments</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that,</v>

1354
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:17.070
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to give me something and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing.</v>

1355
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:22.340
<v Speaker 2>So for me that was sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh god is very good at hiding.</v>

1356
01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great height or this guy.</v>

1357
01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's kind of.</v>

1358
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you Really think about this,</v>

1359
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.473
<v Speaker 2>I apologize ahead of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this loWers your iq by a couple of </v>

1360
01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.020
<v Speaker 2>points for jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peep,</v>

1361
01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:35.730
<v Speaker 2>people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1362
01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:40.560
<v Speaker 2>that's why you need faith because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is no evidence or there is no.</v>

1363
01:03:40.561 --> 01:03:43.020
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing for god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to have faith in that,</v>

1364
01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:46.620
<v Speaker 2>but you don't act that way in any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of your life.</v>

1365
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.453
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no other arena in that in what </v>

1366
01:03:50.901 --> 01:03:53.190
<v Speaker 2>you think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I,</v>

1367
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.133
<v Speaker 2>can I go back to your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friend again because they're still </v>

1368
01:03:57.961 --> 01:03:58.794
<v Speaker 2>thinking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what if you had another belief that </v>

1369
01:04:02.671 --> 01:04:06.870
<v Speaker 2>had nothing to do with muslims or islam </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that friend found odious,</v>

1370
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.980
<v Speaker 2>they would probably let it slide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where you're going.</v>

1371
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1372
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.223
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm amazed about with this </v>

1373
01:04:14.761 --> 01:04:15.594
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This seems to be the one sticking point </v>

1374
01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.130
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is that?</v>

1375
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.980
<v Speaker 2>What does that so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so vachon opportunity.</v>

1376
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:27.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an opportunity for your friend to</v>

1377
01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:28.284
<v Speaker 2>reflect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sincerely reflect about the moral </v>

1378
01:04:33.091 --> 01:04:38.091
<v Speaker 2>priority that she or he has given this </v>
<v Speaker 2>one issue and to ask yourself,</v>

1379
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:40.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that seem just as an outsider,</v>

1380
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:41.963
<v Speaker 2>as an outsider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that seem that that this one issue </v>

1381
01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:45.630
<v Speaker 2>should trump everything else?</v>

1382
01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if I'm concerned about</v>

1383
01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:51.414
<v Speaker 2>their wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned about their well </v>

1384
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.593
<v Speaker 2>priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was also part when we were </v>

1385
01:04:56.221 --> 01:04:57.054
<v Speaker 2>having this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you get amazon text which also felt </v>

1386
01:04:59.731 --> 01:05:01.770
<v Speaker 2>so weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt like nothing.</v>

1387
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:02.604
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're having a video conversation </v>

1388
01:05:03.301 --> 01:05:04.134
<v Speaker 2>with someone and you can feel a weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it and you can feel important to do </v>

1389
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:09.210
<v Speaker 2>it over text felt ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not even email,</v>

1390
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.073
<v Speaker 2>which also wouldn't have felt great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could not get this person to sit </v>

1391
01:05:12.721 --> 01:05:14.260
<v Speaker 2>down with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1392
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.390
<v Speaker 2>that there would've been nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1393
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 2>and that's your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be nothing else.</v>

1394
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.113
<v Speaker 2>And when I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1395
01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:20.043
<v Speaker 2>is there evidence of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have I ever in all the time that you've </v>

1396
01:05:23.741 --> 01:05:24.590
<v Speaker 2>known me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1397
01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Was I secretly doing this yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's the thing that I've been,</v>

1398
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:30.783
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying it about the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to be careful of what I've been </v>

1399
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.473
<v Speaker 3>noticing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I sometimes if somebody has a </v>

1400
01:05:38.181 --> 01:05:39.014
<v Speaker 3>belief that's just so out in left field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really easy for me and I try to </v>

1401
01:05:42.441 --> 01:05:44.720
<v Speaker 3>rein myself in with this internal </v>
<v Speaker 3>tendency.</v>

1402
01:05:44.721 --> 01:05:45.554
<v Speaker 3>I don't verbalize it articulated if </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking that these people have mental </v>

1403
01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:51.320
<v Speaker 3>disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's very,</v>

1404
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:53.630
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll talk to people who believe</v>

1405
01:05:53.631 --> 01:05:56.030
<v Speaker 3>in actual talking snakes and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1406
01:05:56.031 --> 01:05:57.620
<v Speaker 3>these are very nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very easy to talk to.</v>

1407
01:05:57.621 --> 01:06:00.820
<v Speaker 3>I debated the guy in perth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1408
01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I still keep in touch with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>written to each other.</v>

1409
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:08.300
<v Speaker 3>There is something about literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>believes that he talks to the snakes.</v>

1410
01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in talking snakes,</v>

1411
01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:10.930
<v Speaker 3>like in the bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1412
01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:12.530
<v Speaker 3>leave that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did him.</v>

1413
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:12.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1414
01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:13.430
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1415
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:14.780
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

1416
01:06:14.781 --> 01:06:15.441
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1417
01:06:15.441 --> 01:06:16.460
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

1418
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1419
01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.410
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult for me,</v>

1420
01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:22.130
<v Speaker 3>dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1421
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.963
<v Speaker 3>I try not to characterize people whose </v>
<v Speaker 3>beliefs are so far afield of mine that </v>

1422
01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.410
<v Speaker 3>they have mental disorders and I find </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1423
01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.313
<v Speaker 3>I think I find that the type of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who go into religion are the sort of </v>

1424
01:06:36.411 --> 01:06:40.250
<v Speaker 3>people who tend to be imbalanced anyway </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they find a nice community for that,</v>

1425
01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:44.570
<v Speaker 3>a way to discharge those bizarre blues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with the regressives</v>

1426
01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:45.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to keep talking about.</v>

1427
01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:47.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they find this wonderful social justice </v>

1428
01:06:50.691 --> 01:06:51.524
<v Speaker 3>warrior place where they can be behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>their keyboard and angry and smear </v>

1429
01:06:54.441 --> 01:06:57.710
<v Speaker 3>people that get all the hate and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reach and they.</v>

1430
01:06:58.460 --> 01:06:59.293
<v Speaker 3>And it's very difficult for me to rein </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself in and not write them all off as </v>

1431
01:07:03.801 --> 01:07:05.660
<v Speaker 3>people who have mental disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>

1432
01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:07.460
<v Speaker 3>as part of my work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1433
01:07:07.461 --> 01:07:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying.</v>

1434
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:12.140
<v Speaker 2>I hear you in the most that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly hear someone.</v>

1435
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear you.</v>

1436
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:18.130
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I find it exhausting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is exhausting.</v>

1437
01:07:18.131 --> 01:07:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for you,</v>

1438
01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.300
<v Speaker 2>even before the regressive thing took </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold so much,</v>

1439
01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:24.730
<v Speaker 2>this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a discussion about,</v>

1440
01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:25.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free thinking and critical thinking </v>

1441
01:07:27.071 --> 01:07:27.904
<v Speaker 2>versus faith and things you can prove </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you toss in some of the </v>

1442
01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:34.990
<v Speaker 2>regressives how exhausting is this for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on a,</v>

1443
01:07:34.991 --> 01:07:39.850
<v Speaker 2>on a day to day basis because I do find </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it can be extremely exhausting that</v>

1444
01:07:39.851 --> 01:07:40.684
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day I can have trouble</v>
<v Speaker 2>shutting off my mind or I'll wake up at </v>

1445
01:07:44.441 --> 01:07:45.274
<v Speaker 2>six and I click on twitter and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately see craziness before I've </v>

1446
01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:51.790
<v Speaker 2>gotten out of bed and I do find it sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of exhausting.</v>

1447
01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:52.530
<v Speaker 2>What about for you?</v>

1448
01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:53.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's because you care a lot </v>

1449
01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:58.500
<v Speaker 3>and I don't really care about like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative things people send it to.</v>

1450
01:07:58.501 --> 01:07:59.334
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I legitimately don't die of </v>

1451
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:04.380
<v Speaker 3>pressing things that I care about my </v>
<v Speaker 3>family and my health.</v>

1452
01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:05.290
<v Speaker 3>Friendships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1453
01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:06.173
<v Speaker 3>relationships and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I guess in a sense I'm genuinely </v>

1454
01:08:10.501 --> 01:08:11.334
<v Speaker 3>interested in what people believe and </v>
<v Speaker 3>why they believe it and how it's </v>

1455
01:08:14.251 --> 01:08:15.084
<v Speaker 3>possible to hold preposterous beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just presently perennially </v>

1456
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.053
<v Speaker 3>interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's problematic though in what is </v>

1457
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:23.804
<v Speaker 3>exhausting are the constant ways that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>self because I'm afraid of academic </v>

1458
01:08:29.181 --> 01:08:33.260
<v Speaker 3>punishment or they're constantly and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just had another complaint filed against</v>

1459
01:08:33.261 --> 01:08:34.094
<v Speaker 3>me or the ways that I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not that I know that the </v>

1460
01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:38.534
<v Speaker 3>administration has said anything to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the culture in which were the </v>

1461
01:08:41.301 --> 01:08:42.134
<v Speaker 3>Academic culture now is you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have to be extremely cautious </v>

1462
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:46.664
<v Speaker 3>about what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in regard to islam or </v>

1463
01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:50.030
<v Speaker 3>particularly regardless.</v>

1464
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 3>There are certain things you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be conscious whatsoever.</v>

1465
01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.073
<v Speaker 3>If you want to criticize big pharma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just use a thing like in class </v>

1466
01:08:57.681 --> 01:09:01.190
<v Speaker 3>you can say fuck shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say want but don't use a pronoun</v>

1467
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.760
<v Speaker 3>wrong or don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1468
01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:05.490
<v Speaker 3>don't slip again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty $9 with the retarded word.</v>

1469
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:07.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1470
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:08.413
<v Speaker 3>the things that are exhausting to me are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mechanisms that are in place that </v>

1471
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.943
<v Speaker 3>prohibit the free expression of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not necessarily that I don't have </v>

1472
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:22.040
<v Speaker 3>tenure and I'll never get tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily that anything.</v>

1473
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:26.180
<v Speaker 3>It would be a career ender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is a theft of my time.</v>

1474
01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:29.150
<v Speaker 3>It is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to constantly go deal with it and</v>

1475
01:09:29.151 --> 01:09:31.550
<v Speaker 3>I have to have it in the back of my mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1476
01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.780
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I say something else,</v>

1477
01:09:32.781 --> 01:09:33.614
<v Speaker 3>I have another complaint and then I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>be the guy who gets all these </v>

1478
01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:36.290
<v Speaker 3>complaints.</v>

1479
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:39.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's working within these and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1480
01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:39.974
<v Speaker 3>the other thing I was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>last night is that what this does in </v>

1481
01:09:43.401 --> 01:09:47.000
<v Speaker 3>essence is it pushes the whole system </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards mediocrity.</v>

1482
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:51.260
<v Speaker 3>It pushes the whole system because then </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are afraid to voice controversial</v>

1483
01:09:51.261 --> 01:09:56.261
<v Speaker 3>ideas or opinions or give sides that </v>
<v Speaker 3>students wouldn't here.</v>

1484
01:09:56.870 --> 01:10:00.260
<v Speaker 3>They want to be the people who don't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>complaints filed against them.</v>

1485
01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:01.780
<v Speaker 3>So they take the evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1486
01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.633
<v Speaker 3>the ease you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take the easy courses you know in </v>

1487
01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.890
<v Speaker 3>and what they're not talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1488
01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.100
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with the regressive left,</v>

1489
01:10:10.101 --> 01:10:10.934
<v Speaker 3>but our end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cognitive disability in it's </v>

1490
01:10:13.611 --> 01:10:14.444
<v Speaker 3>challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More philosophy were to read a great </v>

1491
01:10:15.801 --> 01:10:19.400
<v Speaker 3>book about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about the status.</v>

1492
01:10:19.401 --> 01:10:20.234
<v Speaker 3>Peter singer has really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff about this philosopher of what </v>

1493
01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:23.983
<v Speaker 3>should the status of cognitively </v>
<v Speaker 3>disabled people be and he says they </v>

1494
01:10:28.101 --> 01:10:30.420
<v Speaker 3>should be more equivalent and treatment </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1495
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to mischaracterize them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to to to basically a pigs and cows.</v>

1496
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:36.223
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's an important </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation to have and the whole </v>

1497
01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:43.310
<v Speaker 3>system is then being pushed towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>mediocrity because professors don't want</v>

1498
01:10:43.311 --> 01:10:44.720
<v Speaker 3>to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

1499
01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:49.010
<v Speaker 3>They just can't stomach or handle all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these ridiculous student complaints,</v>

1500
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.590
<v Speaker 3>so they just don't teach it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1501
01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 3>Why are you never going to get tenure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All.</v>

1502
01:10:53.121 --> 01:10:53.954
<v Speaker 3>I was told that I could publish 10 books</v>
<v Speaker 3>from harvard and I never get tenure </v>

1503
01:10:56.391 --> 01:10:57.224
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the best thing that ever </v>

1504
01:10:58.851 --> 01:10:59.684
<v Speaker 3>happened in the moment after this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my I won't say who is this person told </v>

1505
01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:05.680
<v Speaker 3>me this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote an article.</v>

1506
01:11:05.681 --> 01:11:06.111
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1507
01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:06.944
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well since I'm never going to get </v>

1508
01:11:07.401 --> 01:11:08.990
<v Speaker 3>tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know that there's nothing I can do</v>

1509
01:11:08.991 --> 01:11:11.270
<v Speaker 3>independent of my accomplishments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never get promoted.</v>

1510
01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.400
<v Speaker 3>I it just felt was the most freeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling ever.</v>

1511
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:19.400
<v Speaker 3>I left his office and I wrote a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of something that I published,</v>

1512
01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:22.980
<v Speaker 3>some like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what should the role of the educator be?</v>

1513
01:11:22.981 --> 01:11:26.730
<v Speaker 3>And I said that the role of the educator</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be to change students' beliefs if</v>

1514
01:11:26.731 --> 01:11:30.720
<v Speaker 3>they're not in alignment with reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to be totally uncontroversial.</v>

1515
01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.570
<v Speaker 3>My colleagues freaked out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The piece went viral.</v>

1516
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.823
<v Speaker 3>This is brief how this chronology and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got in touch with sam harris and then </v>

1517
01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:40.593
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some guy from paul party from </v>

1518
01:11:43.141 --> 01:11:44.760
<v Speaker 3>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so said you want to do a podcast?</v>

1519
01:11:44.761 --> 01:11:45.594
<v Speaker 3>And when the podcast sam harris tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need more educators like peter </v>

1520
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:50.370
<v Speaker 3>boghossian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I got in touch with dawkins.</v>

1521
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Dawkins just tweeted it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just started this whole cascade.</v>

1522
01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:57.480
<v Speaker 3>But I've never felt more free to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about anything that I want,</v>

1523
01:11:57.481 --> 01:11:59.070
<v Speaker 3>knowing that I could be fired at any </v>
<v Speaker 3>instant.</v>

1524
01:11:59.130 --> 01:11:59.970
<v Speaker 3>I'd love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

1525
01:11:59.971 --> 01:12:01.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a freedom that I relish.</v>

1526
01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.413
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1527
01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I love it because it shows you the </v>
<v Speaker 2>importance of ideas,</v>

1528
01:12:05.301 --> 01:12:08.360
<v Speaker 2>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the big thing here,</v>

1529
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:10.090
<v Speaker 2>that everything else is couched in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1530
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:12.770
<v Speaker 2>That you had an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shared it.</v>

1531
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:17.060
<v Speaker 2>And then your idea was shared by people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you respect and admire,</v>

1532
01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.360
<v Speaker 2>who you credit in your book for helping </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to this place,</v>

1533
01:12:20.361 --> 01:12:25.361
<v Speaker 2>and then they spread an idea and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess to sort of bring this all around</v>

1534
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:26.623
<v Speaker 2>is what the regressives are fearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And That's why they want to silence </v>

1535
01:12:28.821 --> 01:12:31.970
<v Speaker 2>everyone because they don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't like your ideas.</v>

1536
01:12:31.971 --> 01:12:32.804
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that they're not going to debate </v>

1537
01:12:34.401 --> 01:12:34.860
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.550
<v Speaker 2>They don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they have the truth.</v>

1539
01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:40.970
<v Speaker 2>It is really a bizarre kind of a pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logical myopia.</v>

1540
01:12:40.971 --> 01:12:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that they,</v>

1541
01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:47.030
<v Speaker 2>they have these ideas that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely convinced are true.</v>

1542
01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like religion,</v>

1543
01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:51.200
<v Speaker 2>holding them makes them better people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sacrosanct.</v>

1544
01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:53.010
<v Speaker 2>You can't criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only can you,</v>

1545
01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:56.280
<v Speaker 2>you can't even ask about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you ask how they derived it?</v>

1546
01:12:57.190 --> 01:12:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interlaced in there.</v>

1547
01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.193
<v Speaker 2>So morally sure of sanctimonious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's why I wanted to bring </v>

1548
01:13:03.141 --> 01:13:03.974
<v Speaker 2>this around to relate it to religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had been trying to put this </v>

1549
01:13:06.501 --> 01:13:07.334
<v Speaker 2>all together and there is these </v>
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings that are so the same of </v>

1550
01:13:10.161 --> 01:13:13.890
<v Speaker 2>the authoritarian religious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all there.</v>

1551
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:14.724
<v Speaker 2>It really is all there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they hate really there on the </v>

1552
01:13:16.281 --> 01:13:17.870
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they hate religion,</v>

1553
01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:19.851
<v Speaker 2>christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1554
01:13:19.851 --> 01:13:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Then they have one religion that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to protect,</v>

1555
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:23.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

1556
01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.110
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1557
01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.870
<v Speaker 2>the downtrodden religions and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1558
01:13:26.871 --> 01:13:29.900
<v Speaker 2>everything they do is in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a constant shell game.</v>

1559
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.943
<v Speaker 2>They're just moving the goal posts all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and how intellectually </v>

1560
01:13:32.721 --> 01:13:34.220
<v Speaker 2>exhausting must that be for them.</v>

1561
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:35.383
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think it's that tiring for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because they're just so ingenuine </v>

1562
01:13:37.821 --> 01:13:38.654
<v Speaker 2>and since that's what I've come to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe because many people every day I </v>

1563
01:13:41.991 --> 01:13:44.030
<v Speaker 2>get email people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you sit down with one of these</v>

1564
01:13:44.031 --> 01:13:44.661
<v Speaker 2>guys and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1565
01:13:44.661 --> 01:13:47.090
<v Speaker 2>there's a list of the public ones that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could sit down with,</v>

1566
01:13:47.091 --> 01:13:47.924
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know some of them personally and </v>

1567
01:13:48.831 --> 01:13:49.890
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1568
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:50.873
<v Speaker 2>what could we do if I had been exposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeatedly as liars as they have and as </v>

1569
01:13:56.541 --> 01:13:59.510
<v Speaker 2>repeatedly with bad intention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then for you,</v>

1570
01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.930
<v Speaker 2>for you someone that deals in the moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape Without religion,</v>

1571
01:14:02.931 --> 01:14:04.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And deals and critical thinking,</v>

1572
01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.640
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should the decision process be?</v>

1573
01:14:07.641 --> 01:14:08.700
<v Speaker 2>For me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1574
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.060
<v Speaker 2>because I think about all the times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1575
01:14:10.061 --> 01:14:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I guess I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1576
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1577
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.620
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a piece of mine.</v>

1578
01:14:13.730 --> 01:14:17.680
<v Speaker 3>My friend jerry coyne said this to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very evolutionary biologist,</v>

1579
01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.753
<v Speaker 3>very useful piece of information when </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody's trying to say this without </v>

1580
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 3>pumping this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving this person in the identity.</v>

1581
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 3>But here's what I think you should do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you the piece of advice he gave me.</v>

1582
01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:29.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are going to criticize you no </v>

1583
01:14:30.761 --> 01:14:32.830
<v Speaker 3>matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if someone says to you,</v>

1584
01:14:32.831 --> 01:14:35.110
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know I'm going to donate to charity,</v>

1585
01:14:35.111 --> 01:14:36.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question I think is,</v>

1586
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.960
<v Speaker 3>do you think that this person is sincere</v>
<v Speaker 3>and honest in their engagement with you?</v>

1587
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:47.110
<v Speaker 3>Not what would I get out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not what would they get out of it,</v>

1588
01:14:47.111 --> 01:14:49.780
<v Speaker 3>not even what would it do to further the</v>
<v Speaker 3>discourse,</v>

1589
01:14:49.781 --> 01:14:50.614
<v Speaker 3>but is this a sincere person who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's willing to sit down and talk with </v>

1590
01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:56.170
<v Speaker 3>me and look at the evidence and are </v>
<v Speaker 3>their beliefs to feasible?</v>

1591
01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:57.041
<v Speaker 3>Are they willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1592
01:14:57.041 --> 01:14:57.550
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1593
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:58.630
<v Speaker 3>dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came in here.</v>

1594
01:14:58.631 --> 01:15:00.310
<v Speaker 3>I thought this had a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1595
01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.010
<v Speaker 3>but equally important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to ask that of yourself.</v>

1596
01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if,</v>

1597
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:09.760
<v Speaker 3>if that is absent from that discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a farce.</v>

1598
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.180
<v Speaker 3>So why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should.</v>

1599
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.390
<v Speaker 3>That should never listen to someone on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>

1600
01:15:13.410 --> 01:15:15.520
<v Speaker 3>You going to have this global fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 3>like have your own show.</v>

1601
01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should never listen to you.</v>

1602
01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:20.920
<v Speaker 3>You're not held hostage to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrationality of others.</v>

1603
01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

1604
01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:25.570
<v Speaker 3>That's a good ending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a good ending.</v>

1605
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:28.540
<v Speaker 3>We could have done so much more here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pretty much,</v>

1606
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:29.374
<v Speaker 3>I could have just mixed these up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know that I really looked </v>

1607
01:15:30.731 --> 01:15:31.564
<v Speaker 3>at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could have just thrown them all </v>

1608
01:15:31.991 --> 01:15:33.500
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dying to know it's on there.</v>

1609
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.843
<v Speaker 3>You can have those.</v>

1610
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:38.290
<v Speaker 3>we will absolutely do this again and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then we'll.</v>

1611
01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.840
<v Speaker 3>And I won't bring any of those cards and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just see,</v>

1612
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.000
<v Speaker 3>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the beauty of this is that this,</v>

1613
01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.193
<v Speaker 3>this is big and this is what a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have wanted to talk about and I </v>

1614
01:15:48.491 --> 01:15:49.324
<v Speaker 3>liked the fact that I'm able to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it with people that are dealing </v>

1615
01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.570
<v Speaker 3>with it in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at the academic level and the and the</v>

1616
01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.413
<v Speaker 3>religious level or belief level and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are dealing at the political </v>

1617
01:15:58.091 --> 01:15:59.650
<v Speaker 3>level and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've been a catalyst.</v>

1618
01:15:59.651 --> 01:16:00.484
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've brought people together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've talked about an issue that's </v>

1619
01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:03.124
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More and more people are becoming aware </v>

1620
01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:06.970
<v Speaker 3>of that and you've kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

1621
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:07.823
<v Speaker 3>you've become a figure in which people </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to and they look to and they respect </v>

1622
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.733
<v Speaker 3>for these sorts of conversations to help</v>
<v Speaker 3>them navigate these difficult terrain </v>

1623
01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:17.290
<v Speaker 3>because these are not easy issues.</v>

1624
01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Particularly not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When again,</v>

1625
01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:25.951
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the arguments that people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the progressive regressive have,</v>

1626
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.220
<v Speaker 3>they really should be taken earnestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1627
01:16:30.221 --> 01:16:31.054
<v Speaker 3>treating people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not treating people differently in the </v>

1628
01:16:32.411 --> 01:16:34.690
<v Speaker 3>basis of skin color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are really important things</v>

1629
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.380
<v Speaker 3>and we need to be sensitive to how we </v>
<v Speaker 3>behave.</v>

1630
01:16:38.381 --> 01:16:41.620
<v Speaker 3>We need to be more kind and more just </v>
<v Speaker 3>and more compassionate.</v>

1631
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:46.950
<v Speaker 3>The way to do that is not through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>regressives.</v>

1632
01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:49.203
<v Speaker 3>the way to do that is by being honest </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sincere with ourselves and having </v>

1633
01:16:52.661 --> 01:16:55.240
<v Speaker 3>these sorts of discourses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having these kinds of dialogues.</v>

1634
01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.100
<v Speaker 3>I want to thank peter because he in for </v>
<v Speaker 3>joining me.</v>

1635
01:16:57.101 --> 01:16:57.934
<v Speaker 3>You can check out his work at peter </v>
<v Speaker 3>boghossian dotcom and buy a manual for </v>

1636
01:17:00.851 --> 01:17:02.890
<v Speaker 3>creating atheists wherever books are </v>
<v Speaker 3>sold.</v>

1637
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for watching and we will do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>again next week.</v>
