00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>We're continuing our partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn liberty today and joining me as an</v>

2
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>author and associate professor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Philosophy at the College of William and</v>

00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Freeman.</v>

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do philosophy for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

7
00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good.</v>

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>You are prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel the jacket shirt combo.</v>

9
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>It's very philosophy said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me the rubin.</v>

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.273
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk philosophy because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I try to do on </v>

11
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>this show is I talk about philosophies </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than people ideas more than people.</v>

12
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:37.884
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me we live in a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we don't do a lot of philosophy </v>

13
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>and idea stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>and I guess that's maybe why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why people are watching this.</v>

15
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>So let's do a little philosophy one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

16
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.283
<v Speaker 1>one with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me just some of the basics of what </v>

17
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>people should understand about </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

18
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

19
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great question.</v>

20
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 2>How's that for an open ended question to</v>
<v Speaker 2>start a.</v>

21
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something might take the hour,</v>

22
00:00:58.931 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

23
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.363
<v Speaker 2>at the fundamental level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy is about challenging </v>

25
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.673
<v Speaker 2>assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one thing that makes philosophy </v>

26
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:08.224
<v Speaker 2>different from other sorts of academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines is that you can't really </v>

27
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:14.170
<v Speaker 2>take anything for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're,</v>

28
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing philosophy,</v>

29
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 2>you have to justify why killing people </v>
<v Speaker 2>is wrong,</v>

30
00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a why feeding the hungry is good and all</v>

31
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 2>of these things that we take for granted</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the level of everyday life philosophy</v>

32
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 2>calls into question and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really important.</v>

33
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.023
<v Speaker 2>And so the kinds of philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions that I'm most interested in </v>

34
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.510
<v Speaker 2>are ones having to do with moral right </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wrong justice,</v>

35
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:38.344
<v Speaker 2>injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral importance of economic </v>

36
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:41.980
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of things,</v>

37
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also the,</v>

38
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:44.710
<v Speaker 2>the ethics of public policy.</v>

39
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.543
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that non philosophical </v>

40
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:49.714
<v Speaker 2>disciplines can do is make predictions </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what a given policy is likely to </v>

41
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:54.754
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll opening the borders lead to </v>

42
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 2>higher unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher gdp,</v>

43
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

44
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 2>but all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't really tell us what the right</v>

45
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:04.420
<v Speaker 2>thing to do is say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

46
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:05.254
<v Speaker 2>Suppose it turns out that opening </v>
<v Speaker 2>borders will slightly increase domestic </v>

47
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.173
<v Speaker 2>unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also will mean that a certain </v>

48
00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 2>workers and the developing world will </v>
<v Speaker 2>see their incomes rise by 300 percent.</v>

49
00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this leaves open the question,</v>

50
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 2>what should we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a trade off that we should make?</v>

51
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what philosophy tries </v>
<v Speaker 2>to answer is what should we do,</v>

52
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.860
<v Speaker 2>all things considered.</v>

53
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in a little bit we're going to get to</v>

54
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>some of your moral philosophies that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about,</v>

55
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>an economic philosophies and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

56
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:34.104
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration and a bunch of other things </v>

57
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>in just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But first I'm curious,</v>

58
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>what got you interested in philosophy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place?</v>

59
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

60
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.580
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was doing philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I realized I was doing philosophy</v>

61
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:47.414
<v Speaker 2>because arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say good natured arguing was the </v>

62
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.960
<v Speaker 2>family tradition in my household.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ever since I was a little kid,</v>

63
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

64
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 2>my parents and my sister and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would argue about religion and,</v>

65
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 2>and these sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and wrong,</v>

66
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 2>the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I got a little bit older,</v>

67
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I started reading things in philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and economics,</v>

68
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 2>columns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>articles and things like that.</v>

69
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.713
<v Speaker 2>And I realized that there was this kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of formal discipline called philosophy </v>

70
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.514
<v Speaker 2>where you could argue about right and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and justice and injustice and if </v>

71
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.460
<v Speaker 2>you were very lucky you could get a job </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this.</v>

72
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 2>If I get paid to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of jobs of jobs.</v>

73
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Not paid very much either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's Kinda like saying,</v>

74
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.814
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get paid to eat ice cream for a </v>

75
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>

76
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

77
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty good gig if I can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

78
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.890
<v Speaker 2>And so that was Kinda the start of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trajectory into philosophy.</v>

79
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

80
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because I came from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar family in that regard where</v>

81
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:39.574
<v Speaker 2>we argued about everything from </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics and religion and all those </v>

82
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:44.074
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess perhaps if this is what led </v>

83
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 2>you here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda what led me here as well.</v>

84
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 2>But we're missing that these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think like that must infuriate</v>

85
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:52.624
<v Speaker 2>you as someone that cares about ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you watch the news and watch all </v>

86
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:56.434
<v Speaker 2>these people that are aren't arguing </v>
<v Speaker 2>from like a principled position or </v>

87
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 2>something like philosophically thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>out position,</v>

88
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 2>but just from like a party place or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>partisan place must drive you nuts.</v>

89
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does because,</v>

90
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care about ideas.</v>

91
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 2>I care fundamentally about good </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments.</v>

92
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.613
<v Speaker 2>So this is something that I hope happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my students in my classes is they </v>

93
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.264
<v Speaker 2>come in with a set of preconceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have their partisan political </v>

94
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody does.</v>

95
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:21.424
<v Speaker 2>I have my partisan political beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hope we can try as hard as we can </v>

96
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:25.594
<v Speaker 2>to just focus on the arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think critically and maybe change our </v>

97
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 2>minds even if it means admitting that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were wrong or uh,</v>

98
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding out that we have different </v>

99
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 2>political or religious beliefs from our </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

100
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 2>we should really just follow wherever </v>
<v Speaker 2>the arguments lead us.</v>

101
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you actually like it when you find </v>
<v Speaker 2>out you were wrong on something?</v>

102
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Because when I've had the moments on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this show and the,</v>

103
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:45.844
<v Speaker 2>and the most famous one is when I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>larry elder in here and he just kind of </v>

104
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.190
<v Speaker 2>beat me senseless with facts and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

105
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 2>and we've since become friends and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was on just recently and I loved the guy</v>

106
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.833
<v Speaker 2>that it was scary in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sitting there in the moment of </v>

107
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 2>being beaten is not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but afterwards when you go,</v>

108
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's about.</v>

109
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 2>It's actually pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

110
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 2>So I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said in the moment,</v>

111
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:07.834
<v Speaker 2>I don't like being threatened by it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I got a couple of things I'm </v>

112
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:13.380
<v Speaker 2>going to expect nothing less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

113
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but longterm,</v>

114
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shows growth.</v>

115
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.833
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing is that what are we </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of when it comes to changing our </v>

116
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 2>minds and admitting when we're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the harm in that?</v>

117
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 2>And I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the process of arguing it's,</v>

118
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a form of recreation or something like a</v>

119
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.780
<v Speaker 2>form of exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

120
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.653
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Edmund Burke who said </v>

121
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:33.754
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who challenged my adversary </v>

122
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:37.230
<v Speaker 2>is actually my best friend or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

123
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:38.064
<v Speaker 2>So the person that is willing to argue </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you in good faith and genuinely </v>

124
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.424
<v Speaker 2>cares about getting at what's true </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than what maybe confirms their </v>

125
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:47.960
<v Speaker 2>prior political beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

126
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the person that I want to hang </v>

127
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.460
<v Speaker 2>out with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to talk with one of my</v>

128
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 2>best friends growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

129
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.033
<v Speaker 2>his name's are Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was all into Greek philosophy and </v>

130
00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>all that and he was my intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>sparring</v>

131
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>partner for them from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from literally from 12 years old til,</v>

132
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>well past college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even now.</v>

133
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:04.394
<v Speaker 1>And we ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually agree more now than ever </v>

134
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.334
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of weird because we both </v>

135
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 1>had sort of reverse a philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>journeys or political journeys.</v>

136
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:13.364
<v Speaker 1>But that's actually what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me a little bit about some of </v>

137
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>the philosophers that have affected you.</v>

138
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 2>So one of my favorites is probably John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Stuart Mill.</v>

139
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 2>So he was a classical liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He so his,</v>

140
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:25.664
<v Speaker 2>what's known as a utilitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a moral theory that </v>

141
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:28.604
<v Speaker 2>essentially says the right thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the thing that has the best </v>

142
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:32.054
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that produces the most </v>

143
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 2>happiness for everybody who's affected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that view,</v>

144
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 2>attractive and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and moral philosophy.</v>

145
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 2>But he was also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a classical liberal politically,</v>

146
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.013
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a big defender of free speech </v>

147
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.893
<v Speaker 2>free discussion in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His book on Liberty is probably the </v>

148
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 2>single greatest defense of freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

149
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I traveled with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm on tour right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I travel with it.</v>

151
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a thin book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone should have it.</v>

152
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

153
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what.</v>

154
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned classical liberalism.</v>

155
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows my feelings on this.</v>

156
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.374
<v Speaker 1>Do you see any meaningful distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between classical liberalism and </v>

157
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism at this point?</v>

158
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.233
<v Speaker 2>I think that libertarianism is probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit narrower than classical </v>

159
00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:15.334
<v Speaker 2>liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

160
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.253
<v Speaker 2>but this is a matter of debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a very firm opinion on </v>

161
00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:20.140
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I think of a libertarian,</v>

162
00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I think of somebody who says the state </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do the following.</v>

163
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Three things have a court system have </v>
<v Speaker 2>police force,</v>

164
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe enforced contracts,</v>

165
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.100
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more,</v>

166
00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:33.934
<v Speaker 2>maybe some kind of very small social </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum Milton Friedman negative income </v>

167
00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:38.554
<v Speaker 2>tax type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I think classical liberals are </v>

168
00:07:40.781 --> 00:07:41.614
<v Speaker 2>more friendly to a more active state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would also say that I'm happy to </v>

169
00:07:45.401 --> 00:07:48.670
<v Speaker 2>say that libertarians are part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberal family.</v>

170
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because I had done boudreaux </v>

171
00:07:51.881 --> 00:07:56.881
<v Speaker 1>and here a couple of weeks ago talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and I fall on that path where</v>

172
00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 1>the more I go down the libertarian roots</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked.</v>

173
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.593
<v Speaker 1>I liked that line of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still think there's some utility of </v>

174
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.340
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the more that you have these</v>

175
00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:07.350
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

176
00:08:07.351 --> 00:08:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding it harder and harder to </v>
<v Speaker 1>defend anything related to the state,</v>

177
00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:11.634
<v Speaker 1>which is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Guess I'm taking a philosophically </v>

178
00:08:13.831 --> 00:08:16.290
<v Speaker 1>fair approach to this because I'm taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>in new information.</v>

179
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

180
00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

181
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.113
<v Speaker 2>I'm the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that the best arguments for </v>

182
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:26.920
<v Speaker 2>something like classical liberalism or </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism is just the pervasiveness</v>

183
00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:29.020
<v Speaker 2>of government failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

184
00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:31.950
<v Speaker 2>you look at where actual government </v>
<v Speaker 2>money goes,</v>

185
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.450
<v Speaker 2>not just not in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in practice where it goes,</v>

186
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:35.523
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sorts of groups are advantaged and </v>

187
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:40.510
<v Speaker 2>disadvantaged by the state?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the government just doesn't</v>

188
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.493
<v Speaker 2>work very well and so the same reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>why we don't want the government </v>

189
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:46.180
<v Speaker 2>producing food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

190
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.690
<v Speaker 2>are also reasons why we might not want </v>
<v Speaker 2>the government in the business of say,</v>

191
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.563
<v Speaker 2>running school.</v>

192
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.493
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think it will be fair to say </v>

193
00:08:51.911 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>that if it ran well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this thing was a slim trim operation</v>

194
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.903
<v Speaker 2>and it was financially sensible and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had people of good moral character in </v>

195
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:00.924
<v Speaker 2>the government in the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you'd actually have no reason to </v>

196
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:03.444
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly a libertarian and me perhaps </v>

197
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 2>even a classical liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might actually be more,</v>

198
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 2>have some sort of big government </v>
<v Speaker 2>democrat or something like that.</v>

199
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at least from my perspective,</v>

200
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:15.420
<v Speaker 2>so as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of mill and utilitarianism.</v>

201
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:18.360
<v Speaker 2>The idea that the right thing is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that produces the best results.</v>

202
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 2>And so I think in a world in which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state was run by angels,</v>

203
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 2>very wise people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very benevolent people,</v>

204
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 2>and it produced good results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be happy to accept a,</v>

205
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 2>a big activist government or regulatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>and redistributive state,</v>

206
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think that are very powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons for thinking that that's not the</v>

207
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 2>world that we live in.</v>

208
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.193
<v Speaker 2>So I think that some of my audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they hear you talk about mill and </v>

209
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:40.434
<v Speaker 2>what's best for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to view that through some </v>

210
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 2>sort of lens of collectivism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is going to set some bells off.</v>

211
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.390
<v Speaker 2>So can you unpack that a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

212
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

213
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 2>so for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what it's worth,</v>

214
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 2>my view is that a system that produces </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most happiness,</v>

215
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:56.604
<v Speaker 2>the most flourishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most prosperity is something like a </v>

216
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 2>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimal state,</v>

217
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:00.924
<v Speaker 2>perhaps with a small social minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you look historically at </v>

218
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:06.294
<v Speaker 2>collectivist regimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the Soviet Union or North Korea or </v>

219
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.983
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these don't have a good track record of </v>

220
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:12.564
<v Speaker 2>making people happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the societies that </v>

221
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 2>actually make people happy compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the alternative,</v>

222
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.150
<v Speaker 2>they tend to be liberty limited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Government free market,</v>

223
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.780
<v Speaker 2>a civil libertarian ish kind of states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

224
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 2>So what other philosophers that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>affected you?</v>

225
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.830
<v Speaker 2>You're one for one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

226
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 2>John Stuart Mill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right up the top.</v>

227
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.270
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you somebody who you might not</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

228
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:34.470
<v Speaker 2>although he might not be familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

229
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Peter Singer who's a contemporary </v>
<v Speaker 2>utilitarian and a lot of people.</v>

230
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of classical liberals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians aren't big fans of his,</v>

231
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:48.450
<v Speaker 2>although I think they need not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not be fans of his.</v>

232
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 2>So he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's famous for a number of things.</v>

233
00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 2>He has a number of very controversial </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions on a lot of things,</v>

234
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.703
<v Speaker 2>but one of his more famous thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments involves you will imagining </v>

235
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:00.354
<v Speaker 2>that you're a walking somewhere and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>pass a small child who is drowning in a </v>

236
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:08.070
<v Speaker 2>shallow pond and you can save this child</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a very low cost to you.</v>

237
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

238
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.863
<v Speaker 2>all that's required is that you step </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the pond to get your shoes muddy </v>

239
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 2>and pulled the child out.</v>

240
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 2>But this means you'll have to spend 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks on new shoes.</v>

241
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.573
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly the sacrifice of $100 worth of </v>

242
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 2>shoes is worth saving this child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this suggests that we have strong</v>

243
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:28.360
<v Speaker 2>obligations to make personal sacrifices </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the betterment of the world's poor.</v>

244
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.850
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

245
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 2>as at the level of moral principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

246
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.443
<v Speaker 2>But I think a lot of libertarians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberals worry that what this </v>

247
00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:40.710
<v Speaker 2>is going to mean is we ought to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>large welfare states.</v>

248
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 2>We ought to have billions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>channeled into foreign aid and so on.</v>

249
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:47.370
<v Speaker 2>And I can understand why they make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>leap.</v>

250
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.320
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think that follows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially again,</v>

251
00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:50.154
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the track record of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not the government does a </v>

252
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 2>good job of helping the poor and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it generally doesn't.</v>

253
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

254
00:11:55.801 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 2>and I definitely want to get to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts on that.</v>

255
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 2>So do you view that sort of is like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like a micro macro argument that</v>

256
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 2>at a micro level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

257
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:03.364
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm sure if either one of us were </v>

258
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:05.824
<v Speaker 2>walking down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't care that much about our </v>

259
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 2>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enabled to save somebody,</v>

260
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:09.574
<v Speaker 2>but at a societal level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd probably get swept out of your </v>

261
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:12.634
<v Speaker 2>economic arguments as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more that you keep giving over to </v>

262
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:15.424
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more that it keeps taking in </v>

263
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 2>essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals in their private lives,</v>

264
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they do a good job of saying,</v>

265
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.243
<v Speaker 2>researching which private charities do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good job of alleviating poverty in the </v>

266
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 2>developing world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there are some,</v>

267
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.123
<v Speaker 2>then we would have in some sense in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of societal obligation to help </v>

268
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:39.140
<v Speaker 2>just in the sense that most people of </v>
<v Speaker 2>means have this obligation to say donate</v>

269
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:42.880
<v Speaker 2>some of their paycheck to the against </v>
<v Speaker 2>malaria foundation for example.</v>

270
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.983
<v Speaker 2>But I think that doesn't justify saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>we want the state in the business of </v>

271
00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:49.980
<v Speaker 2>redistributing income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

272
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.063
<v Speaker 2>on a global level if only because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just doesn't do a very good job of it </v>

273
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 2>and oftentimes makes poverty even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

274
00:12:56.981 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 2>so you are a blogger at bleeding heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian.</v>

275
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.013
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this site before and check it </v>

276
00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:03.710
<v Speaker 2>out again before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

277
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 2>before you got here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I thought the phrase bleeding heart,</v>

278
00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:07.414
<v Speaker 2>libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of sounds like what a </v>

279
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:10.580
<v Speaker 2>classical liberal is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

280
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 2>We got a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little more heart in essence,</v>

281
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:16.930
<v Speaker 2>where we were okay with a little more </v>
<v Speaker 2>state to hopefully make sure that people</v>

282
00:13:16.931 --> 00:13:17.764
<v Speaker 2>who need it the most are okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of people will see </v>

283
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:21.550
<v Speaker 2>those terms at odds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bleeding,</v>

284
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian.</v>

285
00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

286
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.510
<v Speaker 2>and that's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great point too.</v>

287
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 2>In light of the conversation about Peter</v>
<v Speaker 2>Singer,</v>

288
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:28.294
<v Speaker 2>because I do think that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think a lot of classical liberals </v>

289
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:31.324
<v Speaker 2>agree that we have this strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation to uphold political </v>

290
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:38.320
<v Speaker 2>institutions that work particularly well</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the poor.</v>

291
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.840
<v Speaker 2>And this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the term a bleeding heart,</v>

292
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 2>libertarians is new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just something that popped up</v>

293
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:44.494
<v Speaker 2>in the last five or six years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go all the way back to Adam </v>

294
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has this,</v>

295
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 2>this argument about the division of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Labor and free trade.</v>

296
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.470
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 2>you sitting at your desk trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>pins all by yourself.</v>

298
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could do two or three in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

299
00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.230
<v Speaker 2>You have a division of labor where one </v>
<v Speaker 2>person straightening up the wire,</v>

300
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 2>the other person's putting the pin on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the on the wire and so forth,</v>

301
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.390
<v Speaker 2>makes us massively more productive than </v>
<v Speaker 2>we otherwise could be,</v>

302
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 2>and then through free trade are </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's welfare is increased,</v>

303
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.943
<v Speaker 2>but he stresses that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly good for the poor because </v>

304
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:19.330
<v Speaker 2>he says a society in which we're very </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive and we have this abundance of</v>

305
00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:20.164
<v Speaker 2>material goods is a society in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of goods are going to be a </v>

306
00:14:22.961 --> 00:14:24.910
<v Speaker 2>lot cheaper and this is in fact what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

307
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so a society in which the real price</v>

308
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.653
<v Speaker 2>of not just necessities but also things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we might consider luxuries like </v>

309
00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:32.644
<v Speaker 2>smartphones or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a society that makes those abundant and </v>

310
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:37.000
<v Speaker 2>cheap is a society that's very good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the poor.</v>

311
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.983
<v Speaker 2>So I think a bleeding heart libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>or classical perspective is hundreds of </v>

312
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:41.704
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you'd probably w we haven't </v>

313
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 2>done a good job of marketing ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps.</v>

314
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you actually define what good </v>

315
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.300
<v Speaker 2>is that too tough for them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

316
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.251
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

317
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big question.</v>

318
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.583
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the evasive answer is it depends </v>

319
00:14:57.051 --> 00:15:00.030
<v Speaker 2>on which philosopher you're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

320
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.913
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so some philosophers think that so mill </v>

321
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:06.230
<v Speaker 2>has this view that the code consists of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure,</v>

322
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.093
<v Speaker 2>but it's a sophisticated view where some</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasures are of higher quality than </v>

323
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:11.144
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I don't know you have pleasure as </v>

324
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:15.434
<v Speaker 2>a result of shooting up heroin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's equal in intensity and duration </v>

325
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:20.780
<v Speaker 2>to the pleasure that you get from </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading Shakespeare.</v>

326
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.823
<v Speaker 2>There's something qualitatively better </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Shakespeare's and then the </v>

327
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:25.634
<v Speaker 2>heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's his view is that it's a </v>

328
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:29.460
<v Speaker 2>life of pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where you have these high,</v>

329
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.970
<v Speaker 2>higher and lower pleasures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>

330
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:33.160
<v Speaker 2>other utilitarians think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

331
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 2>pleasure is created equal.</v>

332
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Other people have a maybe more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated views were a bunch of stuff,</v>

333
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 2>makes a life good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's pleasure.</v>

334
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.173
<v Speaker 2>It's knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's living the morally virtuous life </v>

335
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:47.264
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a debate that we've been </v>

336
00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:53.951
<v Speaker 2>having for $200 or 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 years with no end in sight.</v>

337
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where you stand on that,</v>

338
00:15:56.301 --> 00:15:58.780
<v Speaker 2>but you want to elaborate on that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more.</v>

339
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think that the,</v>

340
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.343
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a good question because you're </v>

341
00:16:02.301 --> 00:16:04.050
<v Speaker 2>here as long as I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

342
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 2>what is good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

343
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Speaker 2>so I think the good for a particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>person is probably,</v>

344
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.033
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a philosopher would call the </v>

345
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:13.520
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction of your informed </v>
<v Speaker 2>preferences.</v>

346
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.593
<v Speaker 2>So essentially getting what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know what it is that you're </v>

347
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:19.490
<v Speaker 2>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

348
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.563
<v Speaker 2>you might want the liquid that is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their glass right now because you have </v>

349
00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 2>the belief that it's water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you have the fall,</v>

350
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 2>if that belief is false because it turns</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to be vodka or something like that,</v>

351
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.280
<v Speaker 2>you might have a desire for what's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

352
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.790
<v Speaker 2>but the desire is in some sense informed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by this false belief.</v>

353
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 2>But if you had perfectly true beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the world and then you desired say</v>

354
00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:40.400
<v Speaker 2>that cup of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

355
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:41.840
<v Speaker 2>well that's good for you to get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

356
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:43.330
<v Speaker 2>You're getting what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

357
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.760
<v Speaker 2>So you basically believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>selfishness is good.</v>

358
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think that a lot of people,</v>

359
00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I think most people in fact have </v>
<v Speaker 2>preferences,</v>

360
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.970
<v Speaker 2>rational preferences for the welfare of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

361
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.570
<v Speaker 2>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

362
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.720
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you make a selfish argument for that</v>

363
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.610
<v Speaker 2>because the way I've always sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

364
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:05.930
<v Speaker 2>or at least the way I use these words </v>
<v Speaker 2>now is by doing what is good for me.</v>

365
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.930
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean I want to ransack the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire world.</v>

366
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to do good so that it's good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>my community.</v>

367
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I want to take care of my own house so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that my neighbor,</v>

368
00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:16.394
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it will be like I'm next door </v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone with a nice house and we're </v>

369
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.550
<v Speaker 2>going to take care of their eyes.</v>

370
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.533
<v Speaker 2>So I've used selfishly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's a little more of ran </v>

371
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 2>thing where I've used selfishness </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually as a virtue.</v>

372
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the difference would be in </v>

373
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.213
<v Speaker 2>say a case where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a walking and see the child </v>

374
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:33.650
<v Speaker 2>drowning on the shallow pond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question would be,</v>

375
00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:34.484
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the reason why you're saving </v>

376
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:36.464
<v Speaker 2>this child and ruining their boots?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a good answer to that as well </v>

377
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:41.270
<v Speaker 2>because they care about the child's </v>
<v Speaker 2>welfare.</v>

378
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then sometimes it's true that that's</v>

379
00:17:43.251 --> 00:17:45.920
<v Speaker 2>a preference that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's your preference.</v>

380
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:49.800
<v Speaker 2>And so you could call it a sort of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>guided or self preference,</v>

381
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.933
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't call it a selfish </v>
<v Speaker 2>preference in the sense that you expect </v>

382
00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:55.224
<v Speaker 2>in some sense a this child's welfare to </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly translate into benefits for </v>

383
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:00.421
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

384
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:01.254
<v Speaker 2>But you would feel good after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess like you wouldn't if you'd be a </v>

385
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:05.490
<v Speaker 2>pretty twisted person if you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

386
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:06.820
<v Speaker 2>walking by like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what,</v>

387
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.780
<v Speaker 2>how's that gonna make me feel after a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

388
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.420
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do what's right.</v>

389
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 2>But I know what's right can often lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>to all sorts of bad things.</v>

390
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.310
<v Speaker 2>But I think you could make a selfish </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument for that.</v>

391
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Like you know that if you walk by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>child that you could easily help and you</v>

392
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:21.930
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to feel shitty after if you</v>

393
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:25.020
<v Speaker 2>have any shred of conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

394
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.220
<v Speaker 2>So I hope right on sociopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope have that,</v>

395
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:32.530
<v Speaker 2>have that sort of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>disposition and as far as sort of once.</v>

396
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.373
<v Speaker 2>So I think also what morality is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned with is not just the good of </v>

397
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 2>the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sort of the good of all.</v>

398
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.423
<v Speaker 2>So I think for what the morally right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to do is figuring out the </v>

399
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:42.354
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the kind of million </v>

400
00:18:43.381 --> 00:18:44.214
<v Speaker 2>utilitarian view that the right thing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is basically that which produces the </v>

401
00:18:47.551 --> 00:18:50.460
<v Speaker 2>most good for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just an individual person.</v>

402
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.600
<v Speaker 2>So it could be in some cases that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

403
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.150
<v Speaker 2>a person's individual good comes apart </v>
<v Speaker 2>from what's morally good.</v>

404
00:18:57.151 --> 00:19:00.780
<v Speaker 2>So you could imagine somebody who just </v>
<v Speaker 2>has no desire to help other people.</v>

405
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.733
<v Speaker 2>I would still say they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something morally wrong if they fail to </v>

406
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:04.164
<v Speaker 2>help other people because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking that person's welfare into </v>

407
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:07.170
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

408
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.003
<v Speaker 2>So where do you think morals come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has been an ongoing discussion on </v>

409
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.750
<v Speaker 2>this show between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

410
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.970
<v Speaker 2>talking to Jordan Peterson and bench and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris and Michael Shermer,</v>

411
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Prager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and many others.</v>

412
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:20.160
<v Speaker 2>And there's sort of a religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

413
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a secular argument for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

414
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm somewhere in the middle.</v>

415
00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:25.824
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a really rich spot to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what people think about </v>

416
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:28.980
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

417
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

418
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Speaker 2>that's a hard question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

419
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I have a satisfying answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

420
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:34.803
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe in terms of the religious </v>

421
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:38.550
<v Speaker 2>question there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this very old argument from Plato,</v>

422
00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:41.100
<v Speaker 2>the EUTHYPHRO dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if that's ever popped up in</v>

423
00:19:41.101 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is basically,</v>

424
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

425
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.083
<v Speaker 2>does God will something because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pious independently of God's will or is </v>

426
00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:52.410
<v Speaker 2>it pious because God wills it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Plato's view was,</v>

427
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.423
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

428
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.673
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't quite make sense to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pious just because God wills it </v>

429
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.100
<v Speaker 2>because you could imagine as a thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment that God willing all sorts of</v>

430
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Speaker 2>terrible family just as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a thought experiment that,</v>

431
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:05.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if God wills us to torture it doesn't </v>

432
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:10.980
<v Speaker 2>seem like that would make torture good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

433
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:11.933
<v Speaker 2>and so it seems more plausible to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is sort of an independent </v>

434
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:19.020
<v Speaker 2>standard of goodness even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you are a theist,</v>

435
00:20:19.021 --> 00:20:19.850
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

436
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:20.683
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe in God and you believe God </v>

437
00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:23.460
<v Speaker 2>has this intimate connection to </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality.</v>

438
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I think even on views like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it make sense to say that goodness is in</v>

439
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 2>some sense independent of the will of </v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

440
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.810
<v Speaker 2>And so in terms of what more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's again,</v>

441
00:20:33.811 --> 00:20:38.220
<v Speaker 2>sort of an evasive answer as to what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a where morality comes from.</v>

442
00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm inclined to say it.</v>

443
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.453
<v Speaker 2>I mean it comes from sort of what's good</v>
<v Speaker 2>for human beings and maybe other and </v>

444
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.203
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what sorts of things satisfy or </v>

445
00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 2>interest to our preferences causes </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure and pain,</v>

446
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.673
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of things.</v>

447
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.633
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that subjective though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the different cultures obviously </v>

448
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 1>have different beliefs and different </v>
<v Speaker 1>moralities and all sorts of things?</v>

449
00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.373
<v Speaker 2>I would say it is not subjective in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that a different different </v>

450
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:05.764
<v Speaker 2>cultures having different moral beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>would show that nobody's wrong in those </v>

451
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:09.904
<v Speaker 2>debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it might be very difficult to </v>

452
00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:11.434
<v Speaker 2>determine who is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think the mere fact that </v>

453
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:16.990
<v Speaker 2>different cultures have moral standards </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows that it's subjective.</v>

454
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.840
<v Speaker 2>So by analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

455
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Speaker 2>you could imagine different cultures </v>
<v Speaker 2>having different beliefs about astrology</v>

456
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:25.450
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some cultures think that astrology is</v>

457
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.280
<v Speaker 2>legitimate enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other ones don't.</v>

458
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:28.503
<v Speaker 2>They disagree about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's safe to say that there </v>

459
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:33.670
<v Speaker 2>is in some sense and objectively correct</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer about that.</v>

460
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.653
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing with other sorts of </v>

461
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 2>scientific disputes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

462
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.980
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that that objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

463
00:21:38.981 --> 00:21:42.970
<v Speaker 1>does that have to come from God per se?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or can it come from,</v>

464
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

465
00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:45.820
<v Speaker 1>the discussion that we've had a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>around here that a lot of people in this</v>

466
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 1>space talk about basically is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does objective morality either come from</v>

467
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:54.310
<v Speaker 1>God and religion or does it come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened enlightenment and values?</v>

468
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.383
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other arguments that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only through religion that we got </v>

469
00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.210
<v Speaker 1>to enlightenment values in the.</v>

470
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's tough.</v>

471
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.870
<v Speaker 2>My hunch is that something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment values,</v>

472
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>

473
00:22:08.521 --> 00:22:11.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm somewhere in the agnostic space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

474
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.720
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

475
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.200
<v Speaker 2>and so I think that sort of philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

476
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.051
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

477
00:22:16.051 --> 00:22:19.230
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard not to be an agnostic.</v>

478
00:22:19.231 --> 00:22:19.471
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

479
00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm agnostic,</v>

480
00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:21.834
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also Jewish and so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all part of the kind of </v>

481
00:22:24.691 --> 00:22:26.670
<v Speaker 2>questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of certainty and so forth.</v>

482
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.733
<v Speaker 2>So I think that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's enough reason to think that we </v>

483
00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:32.994
<v Speaker 2>have objective morality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're not certain about the </v>

484
00:22:34.681 --> 00:22:36.440
<v Speaker 2>existence of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

485
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:37.763
<v Speaker 2>that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't worry that morality is </v>

486
00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:42.990
<v Speaker 2>going to collapse if people become </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist and agnostic.</v>

487
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.853
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when I've had this discussion </v>

488
00:22:44.551 --> 00:22:46.290
<v Speaker 1>usually with conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:47.250
<v Speaker 1>they love to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

490
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.620
<v Speaker 1>God gave us morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

491
00:22:49.621 --> 00:22:50.454
<v Speaker 1>Your rights come from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me it's like I think you have </v>

492
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.820
<v Speaker 1>whether they're God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God given rights or it's your right,</v>

493
00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.450
<v Speaker 1>freedom is your right as a human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>or as optimist prime said,</v>

494
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.210
<v Speaker 1>freedom is the right of all sentient </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

495
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:03.871
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

496
00:23:03.871 --> 00:23:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I think you are born free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that's a,</v>

497
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.220
<v Speaker 1>that's a humanistic approach or your </v>
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend.</v>

498
00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:11.310
<v Speaker 1>The government can take away your </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom but he doesn't give it to you.</v>

499
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:12.443
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's just a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting place to go for all these </v>

500
00:23:14.581 --> 00:23:15.510
<v Speaker 1>political discussions.</v>

501
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.033
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I think that there are right </v>

502
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:19.084
<v Speaker 2>and wrong ways to treat other human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings that are just true independently </v>

503
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:22.984
<v Speaker 2>of whether or not the state happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect them and as soon as the kind of </v>

504
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:28.690
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So John Locke's I'd look in the state of</v>

505
00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:29.524
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be wrong to kill you or assault </v>

506
00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:33.064
<v Speaker 2>you or steal your property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just the wrong way to treat </v>

507
00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:36.124
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really have anything to do </v>

508
00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:37.834
<v Speaker 2>with the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he might want the state to come in </v>

509
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:42.250
<v Speaker 2>and protect those rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforce those rights and so on.</v>

510
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.233
<v Speaker 2>But the rates themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standard of the right and wrong way </v>

511
00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 2>to treat other people does not itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>come from the state or.</v>

512
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:48.993
<v Speaker 2>So before we get into some of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific arguments that you make on </v>

513
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:55.250
<v Speaker 2>economics and a bunch budget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you think are our founders got so</v>

514
00:23:55.251 --> 00:23:56.360
<v Speaker 2>much of this stuff right?</v>

515
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 2>If I'm going on the assumption you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe they did,</v>

516
00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.773
<v Speaker 2>but I mean every time I go to DC and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the monuments and I read all of </v>

517
00:24:02.991 --> 00:24:05.660
<v Speaker 2>this stuff and I just was in philly </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>

518
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:06.494
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned to you and I have now a copy</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that little copy Republican senator </v>

519
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:12.370
<v Speaker 2>of the declaration and the Declaration </v>
<v Speaker 2>of independence.</v>

520
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 2>The alarm at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this thing,</v>

521
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.720
<v Speaker 2>it would set off the TSA alarms at the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

522
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 2>this one's just standard simple paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

523
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 2>It's probably will set off some alarm </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

524
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if I go to San Francisco or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

525
00:24:24.981 --> 00:24:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a constitution would set off an</v>
<v Speaker 2>alarm.</v>

526
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:27.674
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

527
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume you think that they got a much </v>

528
00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:33.650
<v Speaker 2>of this stuff correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you think they did it?</v>

529
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think that,</v>

530
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that some of it,</v>

531
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:38.684
<v Speaker 2>and this is a bit outside of my area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that a lot of them were </v>

532
00:24:40.641 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 2>influenced by the smart philosophers.</v>

533
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.940
<v Speaker 2>People like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the law,</v>

534
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.810
<v Speaker 2>the influence of someone like lock on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>

535
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:48.644
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty evident the influence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like David Hume on people like </v>

536
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Madison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

537
00:24:54.501 --> 00:24:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that maybe that's a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversy in history,</v>

538
00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:58.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's some evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggest that.</v>

539
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 2>So I think that they were students of </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

540
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:03.620
<v Speaker 2>students of philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>students of economics,</v>

541
00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 2>and this helped them get a lot right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

542
00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:06.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I think there were mistakes </v>

543
00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 2>and the way that they applied it and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

544
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 2>the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

545
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 2>like Jefferson's a omission of mentions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of slavery and things like that.</v>

546
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:17.510
<v Speaker 2>But I think in terms of like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals,</v>

547
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:22.930
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that was informed by really </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart philosophers and economists.</v>

548
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

549
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.500
<v Speaker 2>they were all philosophers in their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>right and they were inconsistent as,</v>

550
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 2>as people in their own time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I'm so fascinated with that</v>

551
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:33.140
<v Speaker 2>period of history.</v>

552
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:33.973
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's talk about some of the </v>

553
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:37.490
<v Speaker 2>specifics here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to go to one that I think we</v>

554
00:25:37.491 --> 00:25:39.020
<v Speaker 2>disagree on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want you to,</v>

555
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I want you to make the most compelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>case that you can,</v>

556
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this open border stuff.</v>

557
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.353
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not,</v>

558
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.850
<v Speaker 2>you're not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an open borders guy.</v>

559
00:25:46.851 --> 00:25:47.684
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a crazy borders person or </v>

560
00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

561
00:25:52.071 --> 00:25:52.904
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there should be no </v>

562
00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:55.310
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are a nation of immigrants.</v>

563
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:56.623
<v Speaker 2>That's what's made this melting pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the greatest nation in the </v>

564
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:00.730
<v Speaker 2>history of the world that's given more </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom to more people than,</v>

565
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.080
<v Speaker 2>than anyone ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

566
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.710
<v Speaker 2>but the open border situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially now in 2018,</v>

567
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.610
<v Speaker 2>2018 strikes me as particularly tenuous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but take it away.</v>

568
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.053
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one thing to keep in mind is </v>

569
00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:14.084
<v Speaker 2>what exactly a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an advocate of open borders is arguing </v>

570
00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:18.080
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

571
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.410
<v Speaker 2>So I think most so open borders is maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of a misnomer.</v>

572
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.490
<v Speaker 2>It's more light borders are porous </v>
<v Speaker 2>borders or something like that.</v>

573
00:26:25.491 --> 00:26:26.324
<v Speaker 2>Where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea wouldn't be that there's </v>

574
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.980
<v Speaker 2>perhaps no checkpoints are no </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictions on immigration.</v>

575
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:31.814
<v Speaker 2>Just very few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think most open border folks would </v>

576
00:26:33.701 --> 00:26:36.710
<v Speaker 2>be happy saying that if you are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted,</v>

577
00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:37.544
<v Speaker 2>violent criminal that might exclude you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from immigrating if you have some </v>

578
00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:43.620
<v Speaker 2>particularly deadly contagious disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

579
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sort of ordinary,</v>

580
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 2>peaceful migrants should be able to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the United States.</v>

581
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.150
<v Speaker 2>As far as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument goes,</v>

582
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I think they're really two strands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is just that the,</v>

583
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 2>the economic benefits of immigration are</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge.</v>

584
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.343
<v Speaker 2>So the most optimistic estimates say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we could potentially double world </v>

585
00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.283
<v Speaker 2>of GDP by opening borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've done a pretty good job of </v>

586
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 2>opening up trade.</v>

587
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.280
<v Speaker 2>We've done a much worse job opening up </v>
<v Speaker 2>borders,</v>

588
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.263
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of the productivity gains </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would be incredible better than </v>

589
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:13.310
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could do a.</v>

590
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.313
<v Speaker 2>and this goes back to what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing earlier with our obligations </v>

591
00:27:16.861 --> 00:27:17.694
<v Speaker 2>to the global poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Foreign aid doesn't have a good track </v>

592
00:27:19.381 --> 00:27:20.214
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Military intervention doesn't have a </v>

593
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:21.924
<v Speaker 2>good track record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but allowing people to move from places </v>

594
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:25.883
<v Speaker 2>with lower wages to higher wages is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>far the best antipoverty tool that we </v>

595
00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:30.384
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we were going to get into the </v>

596
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:32.363
<v Speaker 2>nitty gritty number that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you actually have to do then to </v>

597
00:27:34.591 --> 00:27:36.630
<v Speaker 2>secure the borders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

598
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Because that's really what this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

599
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:40.830
<v Speaker 2>So even if you make every economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument that I'm like,</v>

600
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't riddled my way out of that,</v>

601
00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm on board that you still have</v>

602
00:27:45.781 --> 00:27:48.840
<v Speaker 2>to do something to make sure that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing those things,</v>

603
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:51.090
<v Speaker 2>making sure that murderers are coming in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>

604
00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:51.923
<v Speaker 2>And we don't seem very good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think maybe that's the leap that </v>

605
00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:58.980
<v Speaker 2>gets me to where I can't make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>secondary part that you're talking about</v>

606
00:27:58.981 --> 00:27:59.731
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

607
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:01.780
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not sure about the policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

608
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.680
<v Speaker 2>something like the old Ellis island </v>
<v Speaker 2>system seems pretty good.</v>

609
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:07.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a ton of immigration,</v>

610
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>

611
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:13.590
<v Speaker 2>but there still was some kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>checking mechanism.</v>

612
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.950
<v Speaker 2>So as far so I doubt that that involves </v>
<v Speaker 2>building a wall,</v>

613
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.083
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having some kind of centralized </v>

614
00:28:20.821 --> 00:28:21.654
<v Speaker 2>location where immigrants can come and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get documents and things like that </v>

615
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 2>seems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems pretty reasonable.</v>

616
00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.253
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's probably the most detail I </v>

617
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:28.554
<v Speaker 2>could give you on policy ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when you go over these borders </v>

618
00:28:31.771 --> 00:28:32.604
<v Speaker 2>then your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would want these people to be </v>

619
00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:36.150
<v Speaker 2>governed by the laws of the place that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were in,</v>

620
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

621
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

622
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

623
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.970
<v Speaker 2>so I would be happy to write a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an allow ordinary,</v>

624
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 2>peaceful migrants to come in and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply for US citizenship.</v>

625
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:46.404
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

626
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it pretty easy to do that.</v>

627
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.213
<v Speaker 2>Is this though a tough one for a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't trust the government that </v>

628
00:28:52.351 --> 00:28:53.184
<v Speaker 2>much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what's ringing with me </v>

629
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:55.740
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I've heard this argument,</v>

630
00:28:55.741 --> 00:28:56.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright wait,</v>

631
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.803
<v Speaker 2>if you don't trust the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then why do you think the </v>

632
00:28:59.281 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 2>government would be able to vet people </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly?</v>

633
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:02.663
<v Speaker 2>Especially because we now see what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in Europe where they've vetted </v>

634
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 2>people very poorly and have had very </v>
<v Speaker 2>poorest borders.</v>

635
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.320
<v Speaker 2>So this might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

636
00:29:10.321 --> 00:29:11.760
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think though,</v>

637
00:29:11.761 --> 00:29:12.594
<v Speaker 2>if you're a skeptic of the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so presumably you're a free trade </v>

638
00:29:15.001 --> 00:29:16.650
<v Speaker 2>advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like jed across borders.</v>

639
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.733
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be happy with governments </v>
<v Speaker 2>micromanaging trade across borders </v>

640
00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>because you're a skeptic about how well </v>
<v Speaker 2>the government works as am I,</v>

641
00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:26.790
<v Speaker 2>and for the same sorts of reasons.</v>

642
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.623
<v Speaker 2>I'm skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think if you're worried about the </v>

643
00:29:29.011 --> 00:29:32.070
<v Speaker 2>government working well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all the more reason to get it out</v>

644
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 2>of the immigration regulation business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it might,</v>

645
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I think you're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does a bad job of a lot of stuff.</v>

646
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

647
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.900
<v Speaker 2>so the standard here is not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfection,</v>

648
00:29:43.901 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 2>but just what's the best alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavily regulated immigration or lightly</v>

649
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:51.520
<v Speaker 2>immigrated regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think all things equal lightly,</v>

650
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 2>lightly regulated immigration will </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably be better.</v>

651
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:55.623
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you another argument too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this again is maybe a more </v>

652
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 2>libertarian classical liberal argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>for immigration,</v>

653
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.280
<v Speaker 2>but it just seems like people have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to,</v>

654
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.390
<v Speaker 2>to move across borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

655
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.200
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

656
00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno a this table for example,</v>

657
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 2>we're divided by some kind of border and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

658
00:30:15.431 --> 00:30:16.264
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to come over to my side and </v>

659
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.893
<v Speaker 2>rent my house from me or work in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>business or join my religious </v>

660
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:23.470
<v Speaker 2>congregation.</v>

661
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.150
<v Speaker 2>And you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

662
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I do want to do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we both agree on this.</v>

663
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:29.050
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we agree on the terms.</v>

664
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.710
<v Speaker 2>And then the state sort of intervenes as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a third party in this,</v>

665
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:34.143
<v Speaker 2>what this philosopher Robert nozick </v>
<v Speaker 2>would call a capitalist act between </v>

666
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:39.790
<v Speaker 2>consenting adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like they wouldn't be violating</v>

667
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:43.570
<v Speaker 2>our rights to associate with one another</v>
<v Speaker 2>on free terms.</v>

668
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:44.404
<v Speaker 2>And so I think there's a reason to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a border controls violate people's </v>

669
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.113
<v Speaker 2>natural rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there also some inherent problem </v>

670
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:52.204
<v Speaker 2>though that let's say most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western society is the freest society's </v>

671
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.513
<v Speaker 2>got onboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This will then they would end up being </v>

672
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:03.580
<v Speaker 2>flooded with people where maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics don't work out.</v>

673
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Because if we just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you think about it,</v>

674
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.320
<v Speaker 2>like if tomorrow we were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

675
00:31:08.321 --> 00:31:09.154
<v Speaker 2>everybody can come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just as long as you're not a </v>

676
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:13.390
<v Speaker 2>murderer or be a drug dealer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're good to go.</v>

677
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:14.523
<v Speaker 2>That there must be so mechanistic theory</v>
<v Speaker 2>here where we're going to lead in a </v>

678
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:17.824
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of people at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics are gonna work out and then </v>

679
00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:19.894
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get to some odd tipping </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where because freedom is pretty </v>

680
00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:24.370
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are gonna want in on it.</v>

681
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there are a couple of things </v>

682
00:31:26.171 --> 00:31:27.970
<v Speaker 2>to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one is just if we.</v>

683
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I think that problem to some extent </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be self correcting.</v>

684
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:34.090
<v Speaker 2>So if you think that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure to migrate is economics.</v>

685
00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:36.910
<v Speaker 2>So people are moving from low wage </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries to higher wage countries.</v>

686
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Those you have more and more people </v>
<v Speaker 2>enter the high wage,</v>

687
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.623
<v Speaker 2>high wage countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This would increase the total number of </v>

688
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:45.100
<v Speaker 2>workers which would probably start </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping down their wages.</v>

689
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.160
<v Speaker 2>And so you would probably see less </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation to move.</v>

690
00:31:48.161 --> 00:31:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a,</v>

691
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.620
<v Speaker 2>as a concession to this word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would say is we can do it slowly.</v>

692
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.633
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're really worried about these </v>

693
00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Speaker 2>affects of dramatically increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration overnight,</v>

694
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.713
<v Speaker 2>what we could do is just say increase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the limits on immigration by 10 </v>

695
00:32:06.311 --> 00:32:07.870
<v Speaker 2>percent every year or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

696
00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.820
<v Speaker 2>and take it slowly and see where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes.</v>

697
00:32:09.821 --> 00:32:10.654
<v Speaker 2>But it wouldn't have to push the button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Open the borders overnight if we have </v>

698
00:32:13.361 --> 00:32:14.194
<v Speaker 2>this worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is philosophically </v>

699
00:32:16.091 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the soundest way to deal with the people</v>

700
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:20.290
<v Speaker 2>that are already here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

701
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:20.951
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

702
00:32:20.951 --> 00:32:21.784
<v Speaker 2>so I am an advocate of the view that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have an obligation to obey unjust </v>

703
00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:28.570
<v Speaker 2>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that our immigration laws</v>

704
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:30.790
<v Speaker 2>are unjust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think people who came here,</v>

705
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even against current immigration law,</v>

706
00:32:33.731 --> 00:32:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I think they should just amnesty full </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizenship.</v>

707
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be my approach to that,</v>

708
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.753
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

709
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not quite there,</v>

710
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's all good.</v>

711
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not a fan of the drug war?</v>

712
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:48.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

713
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.653
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So suppose we have somebody who is in </v>

714
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:54.320
<v Speaker 2>jail for selling marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this,</v>

715
00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then suppose that.</v>

716
00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're breaking was a citizen of the</v>

717
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 2>United States citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who broke say current immigration,</v>

718
00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 2>not immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>current drug laws.</v>

719
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.713
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that they violated some </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral obligation that they had a not to </v>

720
00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.010
<v Speaker 2>break us drug or do you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what good is it bad law?</v>

721
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:14.390
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

722
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 2>partly I think it would depend on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific offense.</v>

723
00:33:16.521 --> 00:33:17.354
<v Speaker 2>So we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whether they were using drugs or </v>

724
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 2>selling drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would see a distinction there.</v>

725
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:20.894
<v Speaker 2>So if there's someone that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are people that are in jail </v>

726
00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:26.910
<v Speaker 2>for using drugs right now for using pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those,</v>

727
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.793
<v Speaker 2>those laws are unjust and I would want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do everything I could to reverse </v>

728
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:33.950
<v Speaker 2>those laws and reversed the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prison system,</v>

729
00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:35.090
<v Speaker 2>the justice system and all that.</v>

730
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.430
<v Speaker 2>As far as the dealers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

731
00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.273
<v Speaker 2>you can't until until we fix these laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>and figuring out what actually is fair </v>

732
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:45.590
<v Speaker 2>and change some classifications on </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and a bunch of other things.</v>

733
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.020
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's tough.</v>

734
00:33:48.021 --> 00:33:50.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can free drug dealers </v>
<v Speaker 2>per se.</v>

735
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:52.003
<v Speaker 2>Even though you're a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think they did something that </v>

736
00:33:53.061 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 2>should be against the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that are doing the drugs,</v>

737
00:33:55.881 --> 00:33:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I think you have a right to do with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body as you see fit.</v>

738
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:00.380
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

739
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.213
<v Speaker 2>if you break a law you have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would change the laws is what I'm </v>

740
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:04.604
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you break a law then you have to </v>

741
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.460
<v Speaker 2>suffer the consequences of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So does that all work out?</v>

742
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:11.901
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

743
00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Forgive me for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

744
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:17.070
<v Speaker 2>So suppose you have a drug user who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>convicted of this offense and they're,</v>

745
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.913
<v Speaker 2>they're in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but suppose they can escape from prison </v>

746
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.193
<v Speaker 2>harmlessly.</v>

747
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:22.243
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think they would be doing </v>

748
00:34:23.151 --> 00:34:25.160
<v Speaker 2>something morally wrong by escaping from</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison?</v>

749
00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.790
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a good little,</v>

750
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing students,</v>

751
00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:30.590
<v Speaker 2>so students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

752
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.820
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what it's about,</v>

753
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:32.181
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

754
00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:34.760
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say someone was smoking weed at</v>

755
00:34:34.761 --> 00:34:36.740
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cops bust in there,</v>

756
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:37.574
<v Speaker 2>thrown in jail for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a year or two and they're going to </v>

757
00:34:40.581 --> 00:34:44.750
<v Speaker 2>pull the shawshank and get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I think they're morally.</v>

758
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.613
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I think they're morally right for </v>

759
00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:48.290
<v Speaker 2>doing it or can that be morally </v>
<v Speaker 2>justified?</v>

760
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:49.991
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

761
00:34:49.991 --> 00:34:50.824
<v Speaker 2>So what are we morally criticize them if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pull the shawshank where they </v>

762
00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:55.950
<v Speaker 2>escaped to the wall or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

763
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.640
<v Speaker 2>and they don't harm anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

764
00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.430
<v Speaker 2>they just leave because they say I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>convicted of something that ought not be</v>

765
00:35:01.431 --> 00:35:02.264
<v Speaker 2>a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't owe any morally moral </v>

766
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:06.830
<v Speaker 2>allegiance to that law and so I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to escape.</v>

767
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Would you hear about this story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you say?</v>

768
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd be rooting for that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be rooting for that.</v>

769
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:12.523
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of my perspective on </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration that I think that it's an </v>

770
00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:16.544
<v Speaker 2>unjust law and justice people are under </v>
<v Speaker 2>an obligation to obey the state with </v>

771
00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 2>respect to the drug war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

772
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:21.913
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people are under an </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation to be the state with respect </v>

773
00:35:23.751 --> 00:35:24.500
<v Speaker 2>to immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

774
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.333
<v Speaker 2>So I guess our sort of disconnecting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just the unjustness of </v>

775
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.580
<v Speaker 2>immigration laws versus drug laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

776
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:31.653
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think that the law itself is </v>

777
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:36.500
<v Speaker 2>not unjust than my argument won't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of grip on you.</v>

778
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying our immigration laws are </v>

779
00:35:39.151 --> 00:35:42.180
<v Speaker 2>just by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that especially now,</v>

780
00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.213
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also just because of terrorism and </v>

781
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:48.020
<v Speaker 2>people move and just when you see what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on with Europe and,</v>

782
00:35:48.021 --> 00:35:48.854
<v Speaker 2>and because it hasn't just been a people</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get over for humanitarian </v>

783
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:54.654
<v Speaker 2>purposes there we know that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of migrants and all sorts of other </v>

784
00:35:57.391 --> 00:36:00.870
<v Speaker 2>people and then assimilation problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then welfare state problems.</v>

785
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:01.703
<v Speaker 2>Like it just seems like it's become this</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive thing that most of Europe would </v>

786
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:08.520
<v Speaker 2>probably do it very differently if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could look back eight years ago.</v>

787
00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

788
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:11.430
<v Speaker 2>So as far as the terrorism point goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

789
00:36:11.431 --> 00:36:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I think if somebody is a one to </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist or a suspected terrorist,</v>

790
00:36:14.531 --> 00:36:16.620
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfectly legitimate reason not</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

791
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.000
<v Speaker 2>not to allow them in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm less concerned about the,</v>

792
00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 2>the assimilation concern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the welfare state concern.</v>

793
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.890
<v Speaker 2>So as far as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assimilation where he goes,</v>

794
00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:28.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the evidence I've seen suggests</v>

795
00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:29.724
<v Speaker 2>that the political values of immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially second generation </v>

796
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:36.090
<v Speaker 2>American immigrants is almost identical </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the political,</v>

797
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:40.080
<v Speaker 2>a political values held by a native born</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>

798
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.333
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as far as the welfare state concern </v>

799
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:44.130
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

800
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.023
<v Speaker 2>I would say we have lots of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedoms that can potentially increase </v>

801
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:49.890
<v Speaker 2>the cost of the welfare state.</v>

802
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.900
<v Speaker 2>And we're okay with people exercising </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

803
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:53.520
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

804
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

805
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 2>we allow people to choose their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>profession,</v>

806
00:36:56.551 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States.</v>

807
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.000
<v Speaker 2>And so suppose you have a student who </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

808
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.210
<v Speaker 2>here's what I want to do with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to become a philosopher.</v>

809
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:03.650
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

810
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.630
<v Speaker 2>that's a dicey career choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of money in it.</v>

811
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:07.763
<v Speaker 2>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'll end up on unemployment and </v>

812
00:37:09.271 --> 00:37:10.104
<v Speaker 2>this will in fact increase the cost of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the welfare state because now you have </v>

813
00:37:12.601 --> 00:37:13.434
<v Speaker 2>this person on unemployment because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>chose to become a philosopher with our </v>

814
00:37:15.931 --> 00:37:17.400
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We say,</v>

815
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

816
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.040
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we let them do that.</v>

817
00:37:20.041 --> 00:37:23.250
<v Speaker 2>We let them to exercise that freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to choose that occupation,</v>

818
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.300
<v Speaker 2>even knowing that this might increase </v>
<v Speaker 2>the costs of the welfare state.</v>

819
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.343
<v Speaker 2>And so I think you can make an analogous</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument about immigration if you think </v>

820
00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:32.700
<v Speaker 2>it's a right and important human </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom,</v>

821
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:33.421
<v Speaker 2>then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

822
00:37:33.421 --> 00:37:36.630
<v Speaker 2>this is sort of a price of respecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights and respecting freedom.</v>

823
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.240
<v Speaker 2>They sometimes can impose costs on third</v>
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>

824
00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.190
<v Speaker 2>So if all these people come here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what,</v>

825
00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.093
<v Speaker 2>what duty does the state have to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that they don't just get here and </v>

826
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:47.243
<v Speaker 2>can't do anything and then then more </v>
<v Speaker 2>crime comes and drugs and the rest of </v>

827
00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:51.684
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

828
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Their responsibility for the state at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>

829
00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:54.324
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state to immigrants is different </v>

830
00:37:56.521 --> 00:37:59.790
<v Speaker 2>from their responsibility to citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think part.</v>

831
00:37:59.791 --> 00:38:00.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

832
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:01.883
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's also a question of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we would do in the ideal world versus </v>

833
00:38:04.231 --> 00:38:07.760
<v Speaker 2>the real world to say in the ideal world</v>
<v Speaker 2>of somebody like Milton Friedman,</v>

834
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:08.603
<v Speaker 2>the welfare state is much smaller and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have something like the </v>

835
00:38:10.591 --> 00:38:13.170
<v Speaker 2>negative income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't the world we live in.</v>

836
00:38:13.171 --> 00:38:16.680
<v Speaker 2>We have over a trillion dollars of </v>
<v Speaker 2>redistributive spending every year.</v>

837
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

838
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.890
<v Speaker 2>so there are two separate issues.</v>

839
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:20.723
<v Speaker 2>So one is this imperial claim about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether immigrants tend to consume more </v>

840
00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:25.314
<v Speaker 2>in government services than they pay in </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes and it seems like the fiscal </v>

841
00:38:28.171 --> 00:38:29.004
<v Speaker 2>effect is pretty moderate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some estimates say they do in fact </v>

842
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.180
<v Speaker 2>raise fiscal costs a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Others?</v>

843
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:36.183
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact actually there's a net benefit </v>

844
00:38:37.361 --> 00:38:38.194
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of a lot of new immigrants</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't consuming a lot of government </v>

845
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 2>services and so forth and they're paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>sales tax and things like this,</v>

846
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 2>but I think that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a concession.</v>

847
00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 2>If you really have to worry about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>welfare state,</v>

848
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 2>we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe this is not my view,</v>

849
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:54.930
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

850
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:57.670
<v Speaker 2>if this is what it took for me to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>you over to my side,</v>

851
00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you this concession.</v>

852
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:00.603
<v Speaker 2>We could say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a five year waiting period </v>

853
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:08.170
<v Speaker 2>before you have access to unemployment </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits and whatnot.</v>

854
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.060
<v Speaker 2>I would take that over border closure if</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were the only two options.</v>

855
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.230
<v Speaker 2>It's tough being intellectually honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

856
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.093
<v Speaker 2>Because you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to conceive things every now </v>

857
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:17.554
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you just don't see people doing </v>

858
00:39:19.241 --> 00:39:21.420
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like doubling.</v>

859
00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:22.283
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just a ploy to get you and your </v>

860
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:25.480
<v Speaker 2>viewers to Lord on my side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

861
00:39:25.481 --> 00:39:26.314
<v Speaker 2>I don't care so much about the honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get people on the open borders </v>

862
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:28.931
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

863
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:33.430
<v Speaker 2>so you've argued that inequality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>income is in the real issue,</v>

864
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 2>but poverty is the real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

865
00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Let's get into the weeds on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

866
00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:39.700
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes you'll hear,</v>

867
00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 2>this is sometimes philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but oftentimes politicians,</v>

868
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:47.760
<v Speaker 2>they'll make statements like two percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a American earners have 40 percent of</v>

869
00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.830
<v Speaker 2>the country's wealth or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

870
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.840
<v Speaker 2>And from here we're supposed to infer </v>
<v Speaker 2>that some injustice has occurred because</v>

871
00:39:55.841 --> 00:39:57.430
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this large inequality.</v>

872
00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.440
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

873
00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean there might be an injustice </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

874
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:02.543
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can't tell a strictly on the </v>

875
00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:04.504
<v Speaker 2>basis of the inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a philosopher named Robert </v>

876
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.073
<v Speaker 2>Nozick who famously said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what matters isn't so much the income </v>

877
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:13.270
<v Speaker 2>distribution that we end up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how we got there.</v>

878
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:14.283
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody has a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth but they got it through theft or </v>

879
00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:21.550
<v Speaker 2>the God had through lobbying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government for special privileges,</v>

880
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:22.623
<v Speaker 2>this is very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that we shouldn't </v>

881
00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:24.850
<v Speaker 2>encourage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

882
00:40:24.851 --> 00:40:25.684
<v Speaker 2>if we have somebody who has a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth because they invented the iphone </v>

883
00:40:28.661 --> 00:40:29.494
<v Speaker 2>and there are tens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not hundreds of millions of people </v>

884
00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:33.520
<v Speaker 2>who want to buy this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's totally fine.</v>

885
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:37.420
<v Speaker 2>So we can't just look at the pie and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's carved up and say whether it's just</v>

886
00:40:37.421 --> 00:40:38.254
<v Speaker 2>or unjust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to see that people make their </v>

887
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:44.230
<v Speaker 2>money by making other people better off </v>
<v Speaker 2>by giving them things that they wanted.</v>

888
00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Or did they take it through fraudulent </v>
<v Speaker 2>means?</v>

889
00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:47.614
<v Speaker 2>Coercive means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the talk about </v>

890
00:40:49.601 --> 00:40:54.190
<v Speaker 2>inequality oftentimes confuses a quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>with poverty.</v>

891
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.323
<v Speaker 2>So is what we're really concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 2>equalizing income or are we concerned </v>

892
00:40:58.721 --> 00:40:59.554
<v Speaker 2>about making the poor better off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's the latter that we </v>

893
00:41:01.721 --> 00:41:05.140
<v Speaker 2>really should care about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do we go ahead and do that?</v>

894
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.633
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so opening borders I think is the first </v>

895
00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:10.090
<v Speaker 2>step in terms of alleviating global </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>

896
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.751
<v Speaker 2>or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

897
00:41:10.751 --> 00:41:12.940
<v Speaker 2>global poverty I think is the best thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can do.</v>

898
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.103
<v Speaker 2>I think domestically there are a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>government policies that really do harm </v>

899
00:41:18.521 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the most disadvantaged groups.</v>

900
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.910
<v Speaker 2>So I think opening up school choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be a great idea.</v>

901
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:25.893
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the drug war would be a great </v>

902
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:27.574
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think ending occupational licensing </v>

903
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.450
<v Speaker 2>would be a very good idea.</v>

904
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.283
<v Speaker 2>So enabling people to work in certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>industries or start their own business </v>

905
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.160
<v Speaker 2>with a lot less red tape is a very good </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

906
00:41:38.161 --> 00:41:40.740
<v Speaker 2>And wouldn't barbers be stabbing people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that says,</v>

907
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.340
<v Speaker 2>well this is what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some states where you have to,</v>

908
00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.580
<v Speaker 2>you have to get licensed to shampoo </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

909
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.160
<v Speaker 2>But I shampoo my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

910
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.193
<v Speaker 2>I'm pulling my hair every morning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this and I probably shouldn't say </v>

911
00:41:53.151 --> 00:41:53.984
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

912
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 2>do I do with myself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I combed my hair without a license.</v>

913
00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 2>And so far the government hasn't come </v>
<v Speaker 2>after me and I haven't poked my eye on.</v>

914
00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's your,</v>

915
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:06.320
<v Speaker 2>what's your best argument then when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that don't buy into this and say,</v>

916
00:42:06.321 --> 00:42:07.154
<v Speaker 2>well we need these regulations because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have people that don't </v>

917
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:14.270
<v Speaker 2>know how to dye hair are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>scalding people's heads and you know,</v>

918
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:18.230
<v Speaker 2>Mr Burns is going to be dumping nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>waste into the Springfield river and all</v>

919
00:42:18.231 --> 00:42:19.010
<v Speaker 2>of those things.</v>

920
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.843
<v Speaker 2>What's the best argument against them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one argument is just that I don't </v>

921
00:42:21.741 --> 00:42:24.300
<v Speaker 2>think regulation works very well and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think so.</v>

922
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 2>I think the way that the public views </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation is probably misguided.</v>

923
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.160
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think the regulators are bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

924
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:32.143
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you examine the ways that</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations are formed and operate in </v>

925
00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:38.330
<v Speaker 2>the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's oftentimes to protect the,</v>

926
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.940
<v Speaker 2>the interest of the industries that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're regulating.</v>

927
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.160
<v Speaker 2>So this is what's known as regulatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>capture,</v>

928
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.203
<v Speaker 2>where regulators aren't always looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>out for the public interest or actually </v>

929
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.060
<v Speaker 2>looking out for the interests of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that industry.</v>

930
00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.490
<v Speaker 2>So financial regulation is a case of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

931
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.000
<v Speaker 2>You have lobbyists who might be friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people in the financial sector,</v>

932
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 2>they want to work in the financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>sector later or vice versa.</v>

933
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:02.320
<v Speaker 2>And so they're often very friendly to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the very people that they're regulating.</v>

934
00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as far as you know,</v>

935
00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:05.114
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worry about scolding people and so </v>

936
00:43:06.561 --> 00:43:07.900
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

937
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I think that competition itself is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of regulation.</v>

938
00:43:11.331 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 2>So in the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of school choice,</v>

939
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:14.143
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have very bad charter schools </v>

940
00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:18.030
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

941
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.410
<v Speaker 2>the standard here is not perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The standard is what's the alternative.</v>

942
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.330
<v Speaker 2>So we have public schools that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

943
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:28.280
<v Speaker 2>but charter schools have this advantage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of enabling people to choose.</v>

944
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.530
<v Speaker 2>So if you go to a charter school that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>failing,</v>

945
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.870
<v Speaker 2>you can pull your kids out and put them </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else.</v>

946
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:37.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's a kind of regulation in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that it provides incentives to the</v>

947
00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:37.874
<v Speaker 2>providers to supply good service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like we should rely on </v>

948
00:43:40.701 --> 00:43:45.701
<v Speaker 2>self regulation or not regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even self regulation in a sense.</v>

949
00:43:47.121 --> 00:43:48.860
<v Speaker 2>So this is something that comes up when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

950
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:49.723
<v Speaker 2>when I argue with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is they think that I have this view of </v>

951
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.770
<v Speaker 2>private business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

952
00:43:54.771 --> 00:43:55.604
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as being sort of benevolent where </v>

953
00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.550
<v Speaker 2>they'll just take care of themselves.</v>

954
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.383
<v Speaker 2>I have a sense of the public interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe to some extent that's </v>

955
00:44:01.281 --> 00:44:02.114
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's more the kind of Smithian </v>

956
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:07.700
<v Speaker 2>insight where if you have providers who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are competing for my business,</v>

957
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.630
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to care about my welfare</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly or the welfare of my family,</v>

958
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:12.583
<v Speaker 2>but they might just want my money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that itself is an incentive for them to </v>

959
00:44:15.231 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 2>provide good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe service.</v>

960
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense it's competition for </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>

961
00:44:19.731 --> 00:44:22.420
<v Speaker 2>competition for customers that acts as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the regulations.</v>

962
00:44:22.421 --> 00:44:25.650
<v Speaker 2>So I think the market as a whole is self</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulating,</v>

963
00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.553
<v Speaker 2>self correcting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're also a universal basic income </v>

964
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:30.790
<v Speaker 2>supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

965
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a idea that comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>economists on the left.</v>

966
00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:37.903
<v Speaker 2>I've heard some interesting sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian arguments from it from </v>

967
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:43.050
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is your take on?</v>

968
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.190
<v Speaker 2>So this goes back to the idea that it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>important to take care of people who are</v>

969
00:44:47.191 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 2>in poverty or who might've fallen on </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard luck and it needs some help getting</v>

970
00:44:51.211 --> 00:44:52.044
<v Speaker 2>back on their feet.</v>

971
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:53.203
<v Speaker 2>I might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My short pitch for the universal basic </v>

972
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:57.060
<v Speaker 2>income would just be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suppose you could take,</v>

973
00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.040
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

974
00:44:59.041 --> 00:44:59.874
<v Speaker 2>over a trillion dollars of </v>
<v Speaker 2>redistributive spending that the United </v>

975
00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.820
<v Speaker 2>States government does a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>

976
00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.200
<v Speaker 2>medicare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicaid,</v>

977
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.640
<v Speaker 2>unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things.</v>

978
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Suppose we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

979
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:10.794
<v Speaker 2>you can remove all that and just get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of cash payout if you fall </v>

980
00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:16.674
<v Speaker 2>below a certain level of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is kind of the Milton Friedman </v>

981
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:19.434
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a where you get sort of more and more </v>

982
00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:23.220
<v Speaker 2>money the further below the poverty line</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

983
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.113
<v Speaker 2>So you can see the whole apparatus of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the welfare state with its bureaucracy </v>

984
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:30.180
<v Speaker 2>and inefficiency and just replace that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a universal basic income.</v>

985
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:31.043
<v Speaker 2>I make that trade every day of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that would </v>

986
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.150
<v Speaker 2>disincentivize people to actually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are right above that marker?</v>

987
00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know where you put that Marcus?</v>

988
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.083
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the specifics of where I </v>

989
00:45:43.261 --> 00:45:45.210
<v Speaker 2>would put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that we,</v>

990
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the way that a friedman structured </v>

991
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.863
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the negative income tax is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would still get more total </v>

992
00:45:53.161 --> 00:45:53.994
<v Speaker 2>income by working and making more money </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you would see some decrease in the </v>

993
00:45:57.181 --> 00:45:58.980
<v Speaker 2>cash grants that you get from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

994
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.473
<v Speaker 2>but it wouldn't be so massive as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disincentivize so they would be trend </v>

995
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.500
<v Speaker 2>but they wouldn't be trimmed so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have no incentive to,</v>

996
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:07.383
<v Speaker 2>to go to where do you see that as?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like some sort of inconsistency </v>

997
00:46:10.951 --> 00:46:11.784
<v Speaker 2>with the way that you generally view </v>
<v Speaker 2>government because you're obviously not </v>

998
00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:15.384
<v Speaker 2>a big government guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet this is something that's really </v>

999
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:18.803
<v Speaker 2>like I would view this as something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like government should have no </v>

1000
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.660
<v Speaker 2>place in giving that much to people.</v>

1001
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.493
<v Speaker 2>Like it's kind of shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd love to figure out better ways </v>

1002
00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:30.300
<v Speaker 2>to help people who need it the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1003
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:31.163
<v Speaker 2>but the idea of giving more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know that there's evidence </v>

1004
00:46:33.661 --> 00:46:35.310
<v Speaker 2>that it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:46:35.311 --> 00:46:36.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1006
00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:37.163
<v Speaker 2>so I think though that if that objection</v>
<v Speaker 2>is successful will also be successful </v>

1007
00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:40.434
<v Speaker 2>about a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against something like private charity </v>

1008
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.413
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there always is this worry </v>

1009
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.233
<v Speaker 2>that when you give some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>assistance that this will have negative </v>

1010
00:46:49.561 --> 00:46:52.050
<v Speaker 2>effects on people's incentives to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

1011
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:53.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably true to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>extent,</v>

1012
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.310
<v Speaker 2>but that might just be a cost that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to live with.</v>

1013
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:57.323
<v Speaker 2>So I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're doing some sort of </v>

1014
00:46:58.501 --> 00:46:59.334
<v Speaker 2>private charity that might lessen at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>margin people's willingness to go to </v>

1015
00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:03.444
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that trade off is worth it </v>

1016
00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 2>if it means say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1017
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:11.540
<v Speaker 2>we have people who aren't starving who </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't very sick without help,</v>

1018
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.800
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1019
00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 2>a concession that I will make because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think by and large,</v>

1020
00:47:16.051 --> 00:47:20.850
<v Speaker 2>private charity will work much better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than sort of state bureaucratic charity,</v>

1021
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1022
00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:25.050
<v Speaker 2>or transfer programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some philosophical level.</v>

1023
00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that also make people feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>better?</v>

1024
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that like right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>government just does</v>

1025
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.410
<v Speaker 1>things and it either does them </v>
<v Speaker 1>inefficiently or not,</v>

1026
00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:35.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know where your money's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going and you kind of just are like,</v>

1027
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:36.880
<v Speaker 1>you can just easily be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1028
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:37.714
<v Speaker 1>I'm for poor people because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's doing it where when you </v>

1029
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:41.734
<v Speaker 1>actually go ahead and do things and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead and volunteer and go ahead and </v>

1030
00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:45.244
<v Speaker 1>give charity and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just philosophically for your own </v>

1031
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:49.594
<v Speaker 1>goodness and happiness and things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about that that's probably </v>

1032
00:47:51.821 --> 00:47:52.810
<v Speaker 1>much more rewarding.</v>

1033
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1034
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:57.370
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy and low cost to just cast</v>

1035
00:47:57.371 --> 00:48:01.300
<v Speaker 2>a vote for some policy or politician </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens to align with your values.</v>

1036
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:02.260
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1037
00:48:02.261 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 2>the price of that is very low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right.</v>

1038
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Actually say doing some research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out what causes you support a,</v>

1039
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 2>putting money into those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1040
00:48:10.811 --> 00:48:11.644
<v Speaker 2>I think that's much more gratifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should get more and moral </v>

1041
00:48:13.181 --> 00:48:16.510
<v Speaker 2>credit for doing that than just voting </v>
<v Speaker 2>for policies that you'd like to.</v>

1042
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Is that sort of thing?</v>

1043
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Basic disconnect between Democrats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans in this point.</v>

1044
00:48:20.261 --> 00:48:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Like I view it as sort of Democrats are </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like,</v>

1045
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.283
<v Speaker 1>we'll just do everything for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to say all the nice things </v>

1046
00:48:25.271 --> 00:48:27.800
<v Speaker 1>and do it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Republicans are just like,</v>

1047
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:28.610
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>

1048
00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:29.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ended up doing it anyway because </v>

1049
00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:31.300
<v Speaker 1>they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they're empowered,</v>

1050
00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 1>they're always spending the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1051
00:48:32.891 --> 00:48:35.530
<v Speaker 1>but they seem like the evil guys because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to do it.</v>

1052
00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Then they do it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it really comes down to.</v>

1053
00:48:38.351 --> 00:48:39.184
<v Speaker 1>It's like one set of people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying we're gonna do all the nice </v>

1054
00:48:40.631 --> 00:48:41.464
<v Speaker 1>things and then doing them even when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>results are a nice and another set who </v>

1055
00:48:44.201 --> 00:48:45.034
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't say they want to do the nice </v>

1056
00:48:46.121 --> 00:48:46.954
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they end up doing it and the </v>

1057
00:48:47.281 --> 00:48:47.570
<v Speaker 1>result results</v>

1058
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:48.800
<v Speaker 2>still aren't great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1059
00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:49.880
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not sure.</v>

1060
00:48:49.881 --> 00:48:50.714
<v Speaker 2>Although I do remember this book I </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a little old by now called who </v>

1061
00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:56.890
<v Speaker 2>really cares by Arthur Brooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever come across?</v>

1062
00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:59.120
<v Speaker 2>So he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think now he's the president,</v>

1063
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:00.183
<v Speaker 2>have a right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he did find that there were </v>

1064
00:49:02.931 --> 00:49:06.410
<v Speaker 2>differences in charitable giving between</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats and Republicans are,</v>

1065
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it was along party lines</v>
<v Speaker 2>or ideological lines more broadly,</v>

1066
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:11.203
<v Speaker 2>and he did find evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives tend to give more </v>

1067
00:49:14.481 --> 00:49:17.360
<v Speaker 2>privately than Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1068
00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:19.490
<v Speaker 2>there might be a variety of explanations</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

1069
00:49:19.491 --> 00:49:20.324
<v Speaker 2>So one explanation might just be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives tend to be more skeptical </v>

1070
00:49:23.121 --> 00:49:26.510
<v Speaker 2>of the efficacy of these large scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracies.</v>

1071
00:49:26.511 --> 00:49:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Like how well do they actually work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's maybe also this,</v>

1072
00:49:29.591 --> 00:49:30.424
<v Speaker 2>this idea that it's the role of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like the family or the church </v>

1073
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:34.783
<v Speaker 2>or civil society to take care of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are in poverty rather than the </v>

1074
00:49:37.521 --> 00:49:37.850
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>

1075
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:38.683
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe that's why you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives given more charitable </v>

1076
00:49:41.241 --> 00:49:44.260
<v Speaker 2>dollars than people on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1077
00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:45.163
<v Speaker 2>So I want to finish up with a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a scientific experiment that you've </v>

1078
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.390
<v Speaker 2>written about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1079
00:49:50.391 --> 00:49:51.224
<v Speaker 2>I got a couple here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see how sharp you are on the </v>

1080
00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:54.981
<v Speaker 2>previous work you've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1081
00:49:54.981 --> 00:49:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Talk to me about the Stanford prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment credit.</v>

1082
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1083
00:49:59.180 --> 00:49:59.871
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1084
00:49:59.871 --> 00:50:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gone back.</v>

1085
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was a,</v>

1086
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:03.763
<v Speaker 2>this was research around here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't just sit down with people and </v>

1087
00:50:06.051 --> 00:50:06.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you know,</v>

1088
00:50:06.951 --> 00:50:07.784
<v Speaker 2>my work better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was an experiment that was </v>

1089
00:50:11.001 --> 00:50:11.860
<v Speaker 2>conducted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1090
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:15.380
<v Speaker 2>I want to say in the early seventies by </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Stanford psychologist,</v>

1091
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:20.650
<v Speaker 2>and he recruited a more or less ordinary</v>
<v Speaker 2>young men to serve in this experiment.</v>

1092
00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:22.153
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the subjects were cast as </v>

1093
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:25.933
<v Speaker 2>prisoners in this fake prison and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects were cast as the prison guards </v>

1094
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:31.160
<v Speaker 2>in this experiment.</v>

1095
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:35.470
<v Speaker 2>And so they were enforcing the prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and feeding the prisoners and uh,</v>

1096
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:38.060
<v Speaker 2>having them go to sleep at specified </v>
<v Speaker 2>times and so forth.</v>

1097
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.193
<v Speaker 2>And to make a long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he found was that the power given </v>

1098
00:50:43.731 --> 00:50:44.564
<v Speaker 2>to the students who were the prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>guards did have this corrupt and effect </v>

1099
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:48.943
<v Speaker 2>to this idea that power corrupts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute power corrupts absolutely seem </v>

1100
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:55.430
<v Speaker 2>to be supported by his experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very quickly,</v>

1101
00:50:55.431 --> 00:50:59.010
<v Speaker 2>I think in a matter of days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you found were the guards who are,</v>

1102
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.073
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're drawing from the same demographic </v>

1103
00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:01.964
<v Speaker 2>pool as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the prisoners were abusing the </v>

1104
00:51:03.621 --> 00:51:05.660
<v Speaker 2>prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were mocking them,</v>

1105
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:06.883
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had to cut it short because </v>

1106
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:09.373
<v Speaker 2>essentially the wheels came off of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment and the prisoners got so </v>

1107
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:14.180
<v Speaker 2>abuse or the prison guards got so </v>
<v Speaker 2>abusive.</v>

1108
00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:16.940
<v Speaker 2>And so this I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confirms this idea that,</v>

1109
00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to be a bad person to </v>

1110
00:51:20.541 --> 00:51:23.630
<v Speaker 2>allow power to have this corrupting </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect on their behavior.</v>

1111
00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 2>There must be plenty of other studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>proving that,</v>

1112
00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:27.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even through just the prison system.</v>

1113
00:51:27.831 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I feel like every prison movie I've</v>

1114
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:31.100
<v Speaker 2>ever watched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orange is the new black.</v>

1115
00:51:31.101 --> 00:51:31.934
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that are in charge of the </v>

1116
00:51:32.511 --> 00:51:34.800
<v Speaker 2>prisons usually are pretty bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1117
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

1118
00:51:36.021 --> 00:51:38.210
<v Speaker 2>they could be perfectly ordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's also the,</v>

1119
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:40.740
<v Speaker 2>the milgram experiments where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are kind of the,</v>

1120
00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:41.903
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic case of this where you just </v>

1121
00:51:43.101 --> 00:51:46.910
<v Speaker 2>have people who are in essence willing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to torture,</v>

1122
00:51:46.911 --> 00:51:47.744
<v Speaker 2>give electric shocks to complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers because somebody in authority </v>

1123
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.313
<v Speaker 2>told them to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the subjects figure out ways to </v>

1124
00:51:53.841 --> 00:51:57.620
<v Speaker 2>rationalize why these electric shocks </v>
<v Speaker 2>are justified,</v>

1125
00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person should have behaved </v>

1126
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.090
<v Speaker 2>differently and they wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten the shocks.</v>

1127
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 2>And what's really frightened about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it does show that ordinary people,</v>

1128
00:52:05.751 --> 00:52:06.590
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1129
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:07.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I could easily see our behavior </v>

1130
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:11.720
<v Speaker 2>corrupted given the right sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution.</v>

1131
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:15.230
<v Speaker 2>What do you do as a human knowing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do to,</v>

1132
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:16.083
<v Speaker 2>to insulate yourself while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one thing I think is to be very </v>

1133
00:52:18.591 --> 00:52:19.424
<v Speaker 2>skeptical of these sorts of institutions</v>
<v Speaker 2>which give people lots of power over </v>

1134
00:52:23.511 --> 00:52:24.344
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the big picture </v>

1135
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.900
<v Speaker 2>lessons from these sorts of experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Experiments is just be wary of,</v>

1136
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:32.660
<v Speaker 2>of giving people power on an individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

1137
00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Knowing about it I think helps a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

1138
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.010
<v Speaker 2>but even more than just knowing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1139
00:52:37.011 --> 00:52:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm practicing it so when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you're in a position,</v>

1140
00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.013
<v Speaker 2>say to do something wrong because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel the social pressure to do it on a </v>

1141
00:52:46.521 --> 00:52:47.354
<v Speaker 2>small level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just try to resist that impulse and </v>

1142
00:52:49.581 --> 00:52:50.414
<v Speaker 2>actually do the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think it's the sort of thing </v>

1143
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:56.120
<v Speaker 2>that you can condition yourself to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>overnight to resist malevolent authority</v>

1144
00:52:56.121 --> 00:52:58.040
<v Speaker 2>or resist becoming a malevolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority,</v>

1145
00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.113
<v Speaker 2>but you could take small steps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Kinda it's like practicing an </v>

1146
00:53:01.801 --> 00:53:02.634
<v Speaker 2>athletic skill or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't try dunking a basketball the </v>

1147
00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:05.564
<v Speaker 2>first time you pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you take these small incremental </v>

1148
00:53:07.701 --> 00:53:08.534
<v Speaker 2>steps and you'll get better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully built character traits and </v>

1149
00:53:12.141 --> 00:53:15.320
<v Speaker 2>then maybe resistant when the situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes more dire.</v>

1150
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:18.740
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because that's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reminds me of the way that we see virtue</v>

1151
00:53:18.741 --> 00:53:20.900
<v Speaker 2>signaling happening on social media </v>
<v Speaker 2>these days.</v>

1152
00:53:20.901 --> 00:53:24.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not that we're all deciding we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>this power and we can shock somebody,</v>

1153
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you find someone</v>

1154
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 1>halfway across the world who says </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you slightly disagree with.</v>

1155
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Even though you've never heard of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1156
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.800
<v Speaker 1>You start seeing the mob go at them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing you know,</v>

1157
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:38.130
<v Speaker 1>you ratchet up more and then someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else ratcheted up more and more and it's</v>

1158
00:53:38.131 --> 00:53:40.560
<v Speaker 1>all done in the name of being good </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

1159
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 1>The way you're trying to shame and </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed his person.</v>

1160
00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:43.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in there,</v>

1161
00:53:43.421 --> 00:53:44.254
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something kind of </v>

1162
00:53:44.411 --> 00:53:48.340
<v Speaker 2>psychologically gratifying about being </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of a moralizing mob.</v>

1163
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:50.980
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's an impulse that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be resisted.</v>

1164
00:53:50.981 --> 00:53:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's virtue signaling.</v>

1165
00:53:52.121 --> 00:53:54.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not actually exactly.</v>

1166
00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Actual virtue would be saying something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1167
00:53:56.411 --> 00:53:57.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1168
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody here is wrong about </v>

1169
00:53:59.411 --> 00:54:02.980
<v Speaker 2>what the right thing to do is here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's usually a pretty lonely guy.</v>

1170
00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:04.300
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1171
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:05.170
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one more.</v>

1172
00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The asch conformity experiment.</v>

1173
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:08.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's along the same line as the </v>

1174
00:54:09.791 --> 00:54:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Stanford prison experiment and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>milgram experiments in this,</v>

1175
00:54:13.151 --> 00:54:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I think this was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the originals.</v>

1176
00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:20.460
<v Speaker 2>It was in the 19 fifties and subjects </v>
<v Speaker 2>were given,</v>

1177
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:22.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a board which had lines of different </v>

1178
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:27.460
<v Speaker 2>lengths on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there was one that was very long</v>

1179
00:54:27.461 --> 00:54:29.140
<v Speaker 2>when it was moderately long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was short,</v>

1180
00:54:29.141 --> 00:54:30.320
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1181
00:54:30.321 --> 00:54:31.154
<v Speaker 2>and then they were given another line </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were told was the same length </v>

1182
00:54:35.141 --> 00:54:37.660
<v Speaker 2>is one of the lines on the other board </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was very obvious.</v>

1183
00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:39.430
<v Speaker 2>So it was like this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1184
00:54:39.431 --> 00:54:40.264
<v Speaker 2>a very long line over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a very long line over </v>

1185
00:54:42.281 --> 00:54:43.114
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were clearly the same length but </v>

1186
00:54:44.021 --> 00:54:46.660
<v Speaker 2>they were surrounded by other lines of </v>
<v Speaker 2>various line.</v>

1187
00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:49.030
<v Speaker 2>But it was just as very easy test until </v>
<v Speaker 2>they asked subjects.</v>

1188
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:50.103
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which line over here is the same length </v>

1189
00:54:51.701 --> 00:54:52.534
<v Speaker 2>as this line over here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody knew what the correct </v>

1190
00:54:54.911 --> 00:54:58.620
<v Speaker 2>answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the twist of the experiment was a.</v>

1191
00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.553
<v Speaker 2>The experimenter would bring in </v>
<v Speaker 2>confederates who would lie and give the </v>

1192
00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:05.350
<v Speaker 2>obviously false answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they would say,</v>

1193
00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:07.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact it turns out that the short line</v>

1194
00:55:07.631 --> 00:55:10.360
<v Speaker 2>over here is the same length as this </v>
<v Speaker 2>long line over here.</v>

1195
00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:15.100
<v Speaker 2>And what they wanted to test was whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>the genuine subject would conform to the</v>

1196
00:55:15.101 --> 00:55:17.620
<v Speaker 2>mistaken group judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they need to be clearly wrong,</v>

1197
00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.390
<v Speaker 2>or would they stick to their guns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1198
00:55:19.391 --> 00:55:21.160
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody in this room is wrong.</v>

1199
00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:22.750
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1200
00:55:22.751 --> 00:55:24.760
<v Speaker 2>this line here and everybody else made a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>

1201
00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:30.090
<v Speaker 2>And the depressing result is that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people would not just conform once,</v>

1202
00:55:30.641 --> 00:55:34.720
<v Speaker 2>but would conform over and over again to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the judgment that they knew was wrong.</v>

1203
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.793
<v Speaker 2>And even people who sometimes broke from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the group would have at least a couple </v>

1204
00:55:38.771 --> 00:55:40.960
<v Speaker 2>of answers where they conform to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>group answer.</v>

1205
00:55:40.961 --> 00:55:42.040
<v Speaker 2>So is that just</v>

1206
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:47.250
<v Speaker 1>sort of basic built in DNA that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain people are going to stand up for</v>

1207
00:55:47.251 --> 00:55:50.130
<v Speaker 1>what they believe in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's right and what's true and most of</v>

1208
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:51.440
<v Speaker 1>us aren't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is that,</v>

1209
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:56.050
<v Speaker 2>can you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you really like Steven pinker?</v>

1210
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.633
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I believe pinker would say </v>

1211
00:55:59.021 --> 00:56:00.450
<v Speaker 2>something about a blank slate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1212
00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.690
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not sure.</v>

1213
00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might.</v>

1214
00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:04.540
<v Speaker 2>He might say it's something close to our</v>
<v Speaker 2>DNA.</v>

1215
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting when you read testimony</v>

1216
00:56:07.541 --> 00:56:08.374
<v Speaker 2>from people in the milgram experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were some people who just refused </v>

1217
00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:12.323
<v Speaker 2>to deliver these shocks to people even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though there was a lot of pressure on </v>

1218
00:56:14.441 --> 00:56:19.441
<v Speaker 2>them and it seems like some of them had </v>
<v Speaker 2>life experiences that really discouraged</v>

1219
00:56:20.651 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 2>them from a obeying the authority and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't shock me,</v>

1220
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.113
<v Speaker 2>no pun intended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was something like that going </v>

1221
00:56:26.441 --> 00:56:27.274
<v Speaker 2>on in these conformity experiments where</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe people have seen the malevolent </v>

1222
00:56:30.341 --> 00:56:34.180
<v Speaker 2>effects of blind conformity in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated them to do it.</v>

1223
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:35.321
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1224
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:37.540
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not sure whether it's nature or </v>
<v Speaker 2>nurture.</v>

1225
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably above my pay grade.</v>

1226
00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:41.500
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you mentioned pinker,</v>

1227
00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:43.260
<v Speaker 1>this I think will be a good way to wrap </v>
<v Speaker 1>this all up.</v>

1228
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Are you hopeful as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a philosopher,</v>

1229
00:56:46.271 --> 00:56:49.810
<v Speaker 1>are you hopeful for free thought?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1230
00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:50.663
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that care about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations that we're having are </v>

1231
00:56:53.771 --> 00:56:54.604
<v Speaker 1>really worried and I find that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are most closely associated </v>

1232
00:56:57.431 --> 00:56:59.200
<v Speaker 1>with that I have these conversations </v>
<v Speaker 1>with most,</v>

1233
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I would say most of us are sort of world</v>
<v Speaker 1>weary optimists.</v>

1234
00:57:02.531 --> 00:57:05.410
<v Speaker 1>That's how I would describe myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I wasn't hopeful,</v>

1235
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the Hell I could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this everyday,</v>

1236
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm hopeful that we can make things</v>

1237
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:10.624
<v Speaker 1>better and yet at the same time there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt we have an uphill battle and </v>

1238
00:57:13.871 --> 00:57:14.704
<v Speaker 1>that there's so much history all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and all the forces that we're not </v>

1239
00:57:19.751 --> 00:57:21.430
<v Speaker 1>into seem to be on the march all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1240
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:22.840
<v Speaker 1>But are you hopeful?</v>

1241
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I like that term world where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimists,</v>

1242
00:57:25.171 --> 00:57:26.004
<v Speaker 2>I think that probably describes me </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty well and part of the reason I'm </v>

1243
00:57:28.381 --> 00:57:29.214
<v Speaker 2>optimistic is because oftentimes when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think when you're interacting with </v>

1244
00:57:33.901 --> 00:57:34.734
<v Speaker 2>people on a one on one level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to have a civil </v>

1245
00:57:38.281 --> 00:57:40.650
<v Speaker 2>productive discussion about </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial topics.</v>

1246
00:57:40.651 --> 00:57:41.484
<v Speaker 2>Then when it's like these huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just gave this talk I think </v>

1247
00:57:44.941 --> 00:57:45.774
<v Speaker 2>recently at a college and you got my </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother give me an hour of </v>

1248
00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.870
<v Speaker 2>philosophically not at University of New</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hampshire.</v>

1249
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1250
00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:57:55.081 --> 00:57:55.914
<v Speaker 2>And so I think in those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so talking about like virtue signaling </v>

1252
00:57:57.601 --> 00:57:58.434
<v Speaker 2>and a mob mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those sorts of settings are </v>

1253
00:58:00.751 --> 00:58:01.584
<v Speaker 2>conducive to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think oftentimes when you're just </v>

1254
00:58:04.261 --> 00:58:05.094
<v Speaker 2>talking with a person over a beer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have completely different </v>

1255
00:58:08.341 --> 00:58:11.310
<v Speaker 2>politics than they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of a,</v>

1256
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:14.520
<v Speaker 2>a nonthreatening sort of friendly </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

1257
00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:15.683
<v Speaker 2>I think people's guards go down a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more and those sorts of situations </v>

1258
00:58:19.141 --> 00:58:23.460
<v Speaker 2>and you can actually have a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>about controversial topics in good faith</v>

1259
00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.950
<v Speaker 2>and so that I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think people want that.</v>

1260
00:58:25.951 --> 00:58:26.784
<v Speaker 2>I think people want to have these kinds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of discussions and arguments and it </v>

1261
00:58:31.201 --> 00:58:35.970
<v Speaker 2>might be the people who are a least </v>
<v Speaker 2>friendly to that sort of thing,</v>

1262
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.970
<v Speaker 2>get the most visibility or get the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>publicity,</v>

1263
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:42.150
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you took an average </v>
<v Speaker 2>person off the street and said,</v>

1264
00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:42.984
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's grab a beer and talk about </v>

1265
00:58:43.531 --> 00:58:44.364
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be nearly as bad as you </v>

1266
00:58:47.101 --> 00:58:48.990
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it in front of 50,000</v>

1267
00:58:48.991 --> 00:58:49.440
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1268
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.273
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I said the thing about </v>

1269
00:58:51.091 --> 00:58:53.370
<v Speaker 1>the 80 percent before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think in summation,</v>

1270
00:58:53.371 --> 00:58:57.030
<v Speaker 1>you believe that beer is the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical equalizer.</v>

1271
00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Bourbon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really at,</v>

1272
00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:02.600
<v Speaker 2>not beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got this great thing over here.</v>

1273
00:59:02.601 --> 00:59:05.000
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Bourbon is Bourbon whiskey that.</v>

1274
00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:07.970
<v Speaker 2>On that note we should wrap this up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see what we can do with the Bourbon.</v>

1275
00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:11.720
