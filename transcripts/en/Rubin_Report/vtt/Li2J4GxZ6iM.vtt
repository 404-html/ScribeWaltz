1
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>All right people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are live on the youtube.</v>

2
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I've got the lobster and I've got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

3
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like some sort of seventies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that,</v>

4
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>could that be a rock band or is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

5
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>it could be some kind of violent flick </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a mafia movie or violent band.</v>

6
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Violent rock man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've wanted to get you guys together.</v>

8
00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:15.670
<v Speaker 1>You two have never been seen on camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

9
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true as far as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

10
00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I did appear in front of Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

11
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 1>we never intersected onstage at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masonic.</v>

12
00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:28.990
<v Speaker 1>When you decided I should have opened a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you paid your mean harmonica,</v>

13
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Harmonica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solo.</v>

14
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Out of all the Zany moments that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>had in the last two months,</v>

15
00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 1>would you say that bringing Eric </v>
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein,</v>

16
00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:39.811
<v Speaker 1>mathematician out onstage at the masonic</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play the harmonica and have 3000 </v>

17
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:40.660
<v Speaker 1>people give him a standing ovation?</v>

18
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Would that be at the top?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>

19
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It worked really well too because he </v>

20
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>turned out he actually could play the </v>
<v Speaker 1>harmonica,</v>

21
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.260
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try it in front of 3000 people.</v>

22
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 1>It was a first for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done.</v>

23
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't play it in front of a smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd before that,</v>

24
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:57.250
<v Speaker 1>so that was a bit of a bio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty sweet.</v>

25
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so good night.</v>

26
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

27
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I want to cover 100 percent new stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the next two hours.</v>

28
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:07.291
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of stuff obviously that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been hitting on on tour and some </v>

29
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>things that we've been sort of catching </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on as this has all been going on,</v>

30
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:14.221
<v Speaker 1>so I thought the place to start I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be something that I've been </v>

31
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:17.210
<v Speaker 1>starting a lot of the shows with when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>go out there and I do a little intro and</v>

32
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:19.390
<v Speaker 1>to get everybody going and warm it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Jordan.</v>

33
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we're starting to win and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I've been saying when there's a </v>

34
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.870
<v Speaker 1>feeling in the crowd of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

35
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe all of this madness that we've all</v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about for all these years.</v>

36
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe enough people have woken up now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is something shifting,</v>

37
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>so I've brought that up a bunch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've sort of picked up on it on a </v>

38
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.871
<v Speaker 1>couple of the shows and talked about why</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning isn't necessarily the way we </v>

39
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:45.250
<v Speaker 1>should view this or what winning </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

40
00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:47.810
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that would be a good place </v>
<v Speaker 1>to kick us off here.</v>

41
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.040
<v Speaker 1>It's more what winning actually is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>contended with in the current situation </v>

43
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.690
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the United States,</v>

44
00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>but also the rest of the Western</v>

45
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.780
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a political divide.</v>

46
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Americans have been voting 50 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican,</v>

47
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Fifty Percent Democrat for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lecture,</v>

48
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.080
<v Speaker 2>pretty much split right down the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there there can't be any final </v>

49
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 2>victory by one side over the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>because everyone has to live together.</v>

50
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.090
<v Speaker 2>So the victory is how can we continue to</v>
<v Speaker 2>live together peacefully and </v>

51
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.370
<v Speaker 2>productively and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

52
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have to figure out the pathway </v>

53
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>forward to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I think there's another kind of</v>

54
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 2>victory that it's deeper than that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on the horizon,</v>

55
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:37.681
<v Speaker 2>which is that I think the narrative that</v>
<v Speaker 2>underlies our culture as a whole has to </v>

56
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 2>shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started to think about this when I</v>

57
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 2>was working for a UN committee about </v>
<v Speaker 2>five years ago.</v>

58
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 2>I worked on a committee on </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainability for the secretary general</v>

59
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.500
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a chance with the people that I </v>

60
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 2>was working for and with in Canada to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rewrite the underlying narrative because</v>

61
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 2>it was very pessimistic.</v>

62
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.990
<v Speaker 2>It was real cold war narrative north </v>
<v Speaker 2>against south and capitalists against </v>

63
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Socialists and doom and gloom on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>horizon.</v>

64
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 2>And it seemed to me to be outdated </v>
<v Speaker 2>really by about 40 years.</v>

65
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160
<v Speaker 2>And I started to read a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic development and ecology </v>

66
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.121
<v Speaker 2>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And mostly what I found was that things </v>

67
00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:18.151
<v Speaker 2>are getting better globally so fast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>on so many different dimensions that </v>

68
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 2>it's almost inconceivable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet no one seems to know that.</v>

69
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.640
<v Speaker 2>And in the aftermath of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been about six books published </v>

70
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.521
<v Speaker 2>in the last five years that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>pinker's book and lightened it right </v>

71
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:29.521
<v Speaker 2>over here somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

72
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

73
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.650
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by no means that's by no means the </v>

74
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.801
<v Speaker 2>only book detailing now a revolution in </v>
<v Speaker 2>living standard progress and,</v>

75
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 2>and ecological progress for that matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world.</v>

76
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's two victories to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>held here to be had here.</v>

77
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:49.381
<v Speaker 2>One is to pull us everyone out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pessimistic apocalyptic Cold War </v>

78
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:56.191
<v Speaker 2>narrative that enveloped us for four or </v>
<v Speaker 2>five decades and to notice that the </v>

79
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 2>future could actually be bright if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were careful.</v>

80
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:02.671
<v Speaker 2>And the second is to make sure that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political dialogue in the West doesn't </v>

81
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 2>polarize to the degree that we start </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things that are fatally stupid.</v>

82
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's talk about the second part </v>

83
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 2>first</v>

84
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.100
<v Speaker 3>because I think that's where we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>really been focusing on the political </v>

85
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.620
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's interesting to note there's a 50</v>

86
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:19.440
<v Speaker 3>slash 50 divides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's a reason.</v>

87
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.570
<v Speaker 3>I guess I have a strongly different take</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe it's the same.</v>

88
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 3>We'll have to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

89
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.870
<v Speaker 3>the 50 slash 50 mark is going to more or</v>
<v Speaker 3>less hold as long as these two parties </v>

90
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:37.140
<v Speaker 3>can calculate a what's the maximum they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

91
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w with the minimum they have to give up </v>

92
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.230
<v Speaker 3>to win an election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>

93
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.580
<v Speaker 3>the key issue is what is the 50 slash 50</v>
<v Speaker 3>composition look like?</v>

94
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:49.581
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately what it keeps looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>like is the two parties becoming more </v>

95
00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:54.291
<v Speaker 3>and more a nightmarish in my mind and </v>
<v Speaker 3>less trustworthy.</v>

96
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:56.730
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 50 slash 50 continues to hold.</v>

97
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.080
<v Speaker 3>But what it represents as a tension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tension increases is getting much </v>

98
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.080
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>

99
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 3>So the key issue is that those of us who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are sort of center,</v>

100
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't love the left right </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum,</v>

101
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:13.421
<v Speaker 3>but let's just use it as shorthand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the center left and the center right </v>

102
00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:16.721
<v Speaker 3>have to see each other as our natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>allies and the center left has to Clean </v>

103
00:06:16.721 --> 00:06:21.460
<v Speaker 3>House and get rid of the night he left </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the center right has to get rid of </v>

104
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 3>the far right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the optimistic scenario.</v>

105
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 3>I think winning is incredibly important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

106
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:30.461
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting way of </v>

107
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:30.461
<v Speaker 3>conceptualizing it and let me go a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit further.</v>

108
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we have to stop being </v>

109
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 3>apologetic about winning and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>winning means.</v>

110
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Winning means that the advanced guard of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the a radical center,</v>

111
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to make this a safe and habitable </v>

112
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 3>space again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in order to do that,</v>

113
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason I,</v>

114
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:53.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to focus mostly most of my negative </v>

115
00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:56.561
<v Speaker 3>energy on the left is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's my responsibility to clean </v>

116
00:06:56.561 --> 00:07:00.791
<v Speaker 3>house on the radical bad progressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement that is almost certainly going </v>

117
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 3>to fuel the far right.</v>

118
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not efficient for me to go after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the far right because,</v>

119
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course I'm going to be anti Nazi </v>

120
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.510
<v Speaker 3>skinhead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

121
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.360
<v Speaker 3>But what we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about that a lot too </v>

122
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.360
<v Speaker 3>because when we do the events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

123
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.291
<v Speaker 3>you will all these hit pieces that come </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and we'll talk a little bit about </v>

124
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:20.291
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

125
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 3>when they say that your audience is all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these angry white men,</v>

126
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this nonsense,</v>

127
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 3>which every night it is proven to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>false,</v>

128
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

129
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you address that every night talking </v>

130
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:31.840
<v Speaker 3>about the bad identity politics of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

131
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 3>but it's not something that well </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullied.</v>

132
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 3>The thing that's strange and then that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ties into what you're saying as well,</v>

133
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:40.210
<v Speaker 3>is that it isn't obvious to me who the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous right are,</v>

134
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's obvious to me who the dangerous </v>

135
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Lakhdar because they occupied the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities but not just the </v>

136
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.160
<v Speaker 3>universities.</v>

137
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.160
<v Speaker 3>This is an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

138
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 3>this is so mispunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>

139
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.990
<v Speaker 3>that we have to really break the frame </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

140
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 3>and reweave it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

141
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the journalists keep saying,</v>

142
00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:01.931
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are focusing on a tiny problem </v>

143
00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:03.350
<v Speaker 3>afflicting a few universities that </v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly nobody's ever heard of.</v>

144
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.130
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

145
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.270
<v Speaker 3>the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it deflects the problem from </v>

146
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.091
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number one problem isn't the </v>

147
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:13.091
<v Speaker 3>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's journalism.</v>

148
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is that the journalists </v>
<v Speaker 3>are saying,</v>

149
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:16.630
<v Speaker 3>you guys are complaining about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

150
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 3>the small story in the university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

151
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

152
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:25.210
<v Speaker 3>you're getting it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're complaining about the number one </v>

153
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.851
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the sensemaking a apparatus </v>

154
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 3>having gone haywire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you think about these journalists</v>

155
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:34.901
<v Speaker 3>that we're now dealing with as like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hermit crabs that have crawled into the </v>

156
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 3>shells that we used to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

157
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:40.781
<v Speaker 3>So whether it's CNN or NPR or national </v>
<v Speaker 3>review or whatever these structures are,</v>

158
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 3>it's a different group of hermit crab </v>
<v Speaker 3>shells are the same.</v>

159
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.020
<v Speaker 3>And the great danger is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize the font at the top of the La </v>

160
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>The New York Times,</v>

161
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.790
<v Speaker 3>you think you're getting the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>product,</v>

162
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:54.590
<v Speaker 3>but the product has become radically </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

163
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was a problem</v>

164
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.230
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>

165
00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there wasn't.</v>

166
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

167
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:04.701
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue is that when we criticize </v>

168
00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:06.450
<v Speaker 2>journalists now they think we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing journalism far from it.</v>

169
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:11.000
<v Speaker 2>We are praying for journalists and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea is,</v>

170
00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:16.001
<v Speaker 2>is that we are fighting this thing where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got their fingers so clearly on </v>

171
00:09:16.001 --> 00:09:19.050
<v Speaker 2>the scale that everything is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>tipped and what you're getting is a more</v>

172
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:21.120
<v Speaker 2>distorted reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some point at which,</v>

173
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 2>and we have to talk about what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

174
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to pronounce it best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IATROGENIC medicine,</v>

175
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 2>the idea that doctors are creating a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>created a huge amount of the harm done </v>

176
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 2>found in hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

177
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe stairs are the fourth leading </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause of death,</v>

178
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we have to talk not about yet </v>

179
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:42.830
<v Speaker 2>regenix which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

180
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:42.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

181
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 2>that which originates from the healers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but journal genics,</v>

182
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 2>which is what is the harm done to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth by journalists.</v>

183
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.260
<v Speaker 2>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have a,</v>

184
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a technological slapped on that to some </v>

185
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.951
<v Speaker 2>degree because one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is happening because I've watched </v>

186
00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 2>large organizations degenerate because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've worked as a consultant for a lot of</v>

187
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:05.181
<v Speaker 2>years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting to see how fast </v>

188
00:10:05.181 --> 00:10:08.950
<v Speaker 2>a large organization that you think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>semipermanent can disintegrate.</v>

189
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 2>It can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

190
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:15.471
<v Speaker 2>certainly within the span of a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and sometimes a lot faster than </v>

191
00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:15.471
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

192
00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think one of the things that seems</v>

193
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:21.471
<v Speaker 2>to be happening to me is that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>television dies under the weight of </v>

194
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:25.340
<v Speaker 2>youtube primarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say online video and perhaps </v>

195
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 2>also podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the remaining journalists,</v>

196
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 2>the hermit crabs who occupied the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>shells,</v>

197
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:31.590
<v Speaker 2>which is a good way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

198
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.320
<v Speaker 2>gets increasingly desperate for </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

199
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.620
<v Speaker 2>And so there are pushed by economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure in some sense and situational </v>

200
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 2>pressure to exaggerate the danger.</v>

201
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a clickbait phenomena </v>

202
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.471
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me to be akin to what's </v>

203
00:10:48.471 --> 00:10:48.471
<v Speaker 2>happened with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with reports on the crime rate.</v>

204
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

205
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.080
<v Speaker 2>over the last 25 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the five major indices of violent crime </v>

206
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 2>have declined by 50 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is absolutely in,</v>

207
00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 2>in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Staggering decrease.</v>

208
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 2>But the rate of reporting of violent </v>
<v Speaker 2>crime has gone up substantially.</v>

209
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:07.410
<v Speaker 2>And so people think that things are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous now than they were,</v>

210
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 2>even though they're safer now than they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been since the early sixties.</v>

211
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.260
<v Speaker 2>And they were safe for them than they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been in history.</v>

212
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:18.590
<v Speaker 2>So I think one of the things in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's interesting to think about the </v>

213
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.011
<v Speaker 2>technological forces driving this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because youtube and podcast do pose a </v>

214
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.860
<v Speaker 2>fatal threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say certainly to to to </v>

215
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.981
<v Speaker 2>television and so it makes sense to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as the journalists become less </v>

216
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:34.710
<v Speaker 2>professional and less in demand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their messages Ha has,</v>

217
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.760
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

218
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 2>is chasing a diminishing audience that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get noisier and noisier</v>

219
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:45.141
<v Speaker 2>about what's going on and the trick for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else who's being immersed in </v>

220
00:11:45.141 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 2>that is to stay sane and sensible while </v>
<v Speaker 2>the death throes play themselves out.</v>

221
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 2>So wouldn't you naturally think though </v>
<v Speaker 2>that more of them would start seeing </v>

222
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what we</v>

223
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.470
<v Speaker 3>now see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so clearly I meant more of them would be</v>

224
00:11:56.471 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 3>jumping ship or is that old shells so </v>
<v Speaker 3>tainted or corroded?</v>

225
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 3>That getting out of that thing is almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>impossible.</v>

226
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with systems of selective </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>

227
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:09.781
<v Speaker 3>So Jordan raises an excellent point that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dying throws of an institution tend </v>

228
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:15.961
<v Speaker 3>to be its most violent because it's go </v>
<v Speaker 3>for broke mode and not worrying about </v>

229
00:12:15.961 --> 00:12:19.651
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worrying about maybe serve up </v>

230
00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:19.651
<v Speaker 3>buying another month or two or who knows</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

231
00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 3>but there's another issue of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that the formats are set.</v>

232
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so your news comes to you in a form that</v>

233
00:12:27.131 --> 00:12:30.310
<v Speaker 3>is more or less the same every day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know how to consume it.</v>

234
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.780
<v Speaker 3>So everybody listens to NPR,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a pre,</v>

235
00:12:32.781 --> 00:12:37.781
<v Speaker 3>grooved a template in their brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get the top stories at the </v>

236
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:42.211
<v Speaker 3>top of the hour and then they're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be this many pieces and there'll be </v>

237
00:12:42.211 --> 00:12:42.211
<v Speaker 3>like a feel good story.</v>

238
00:12:42.211 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 3>So you know exactly what you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

239
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.070
<v Speaker 3>Like here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know where we're going to.</v>

240
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.810
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Jordan and I are going to come to </v>
<v Speaker 3>blows open.</v>

241
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 3>You've got to change the drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other thing that,</v>

242
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:55.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

243
00:12:55.351 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 3>is it in the system of selective </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressures,</v>

244
00:12:57.191 --> 00:13:02.191
<v Speaker 3>as the business model fails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a fascinating phenomena which </v>

245
00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:03.120
<v Speaker 3>people who are willing to accept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

246
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.700
<v Speaker 3>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

247
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blends of payment.</v>

248
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.920
<v Speaker 3>So lower financial payment and security </v>
<v Speaker 3>job security,</v>

249
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.570
<v Speaker 3>but higher psychic payment stemming from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that they are crusading,</v>

250
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to start to dominate.</v>

251
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:23.851
<v Speaker 3>So you're seeing many more people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are willing to substitute activism and </v>

252
00:13:23.851 --> 00:13:27.760
<v Speaker 3>the sense that they are protecting us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a great story about the resistance,</v>

253
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:28.770
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

254
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:34.650
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually becomes more and more </v>

255
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.250
<v Speaker 3>necessary as the stability and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>viability of the system degenerate,</v>

256
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:36.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

257
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.050
<v Speaker 3>If you could offer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

258
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$200,000</v>

259
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:43.690
<v Speaker 3>salaries to a good reporters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

260
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:48.750
<v Speaker 3>in short order so that they could start </v>
<v Speaker 3>families and buy homes and have an </v>

261
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.291
<v Speaker 3>easier life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the things that you need to </v>

262
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:52.540
<v Speaker 3>do is you need to pay people more if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're unhappy with them.</v>

263
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.340
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I learned about that,</v>

264
00:13:54.341 --> 00:13:57.370
<v Speaker 3>about professors to actually sociology </v>
<v Speaker 3>professors had,</v>

265
00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:59.680
<v Speaker 3>their salary's tripled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be a lot less radically.</v>

266
00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:04.681
<v Speaker 3>I learned this from the New Orleans </v>
<v Speaker 3>police department where at some point </v>

267
00:14:04.681 --> 00:14:07.210
<v Speaker 3>they had a corruption where people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordering a mob style,</v>

268
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:12.211
<v Speaker 3>hits over police radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what happened was that the </v>

269
00:14:12.211 --> 00:14:15.690
<v Speaker 3>new police chief came in and he said the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first thing he did was raise salaries </v>

270
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.770
<v Speaker 3>and the idea being that you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>skin in the game thanks to the scene to </v>

271
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.640
<v Speaker 3>levees that phrases a proliferative </v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks the same wherever you are,</v>

272
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you need to give people something to</v>

273
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 3>defend.</v>

274
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 3>And so it's very important to pay the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that we are,</v>

275
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decrying all the time.</v>

276
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.510
<v Speaker 3>Say everybody who's listening should go </v>
<v Speaker 3>online and donate to quill.</v>

277
00:14:38.511 --> 00:14:43.180
<v Speaker 3>X patron page is doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying that we should,</v>

278
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:47.320
<v Speaker 3>we should try to figure out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>vox more money as well and we should try</v>

279
00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:52.321
<v Speaker 3>to figure out how to get slate and salon</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of these things so that you can </v>

280
00:14:52.321 --> 00:14:56.201
<v Speaker 3>afford to pay people in ways in which </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to take a large portion </v>

281
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:02.630
<v Speaker 3>of their payment as psychic </v>
<v Speaker 3>gratification from having Feld Imaginary</v>

282
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just to be clear there,</v>

283
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:08.591
<v Speaker 3>when you're saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not saying that the current </v>

284
00:15:08.591 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 3>people who have screwed this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>up deserve more money.</v>

285
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 3>You're going to find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can find,</v>

286
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:14.930
<v Speaker 3>I have a very strange position on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is in,</v>

287
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:15.660
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

288
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Peter Teal,</v>

289
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 3>and I talk about this all the time.</v>

290
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his model is that,</v>

291
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at some level when the economy isn't </v>

292
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.181
<v Speaker 3>working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people engage in this kind of </v>

293
00:15:28.181 --> 00:15:29.180
<v Speaker 3>nonsensical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fratricide,</v>

294
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:29.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

295
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 3>of a type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my point is slightly different,</v>

296
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 3>which is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this bad nature is always there,</v>

297
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:39.550
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a compromised immune </v>
<v Speaker 3>system when the,</v>

298
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:44.710
<v Speaker 3>when the economy starts to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start to become aware of all of the </v>

299
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 3>pathogens in the world because it can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight them off.</v>

300
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very much the issue that if you're </v>

301
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.301
<v Speaker 3>the guy with compromised immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the only one aware of all the </v>

302
00:15:55.301 --> 00:15:55.301
<v Speaker 3>pathogens in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

303
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:59.090
<v Speaker 3>and so at the moment our collective </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic community system is failing,</v>

304
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:04.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I actually am much more pessimistic </v>

305
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.761
<v Speaker 3>than you are Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see lots of reasons to be happy about </v>

306
00:16:06.761 --> 00:16:06.890
<v Speaker 3>the decrease in violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

307
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:11.891
<v Speaker 3>one of the problems with the accounting </v>
<v Speaker 3>in these theories is that the sword of </v>

308
00:16:11.891 --> 00:16:15.131
<v Speaker 3>Damocles that hangs over our heads is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has gotten quite large and the number of</v>

309
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.800
<v Speaker 3>threads holding it up or seem very few </v>
<v Speaker 3>in number and so you have to do the </v>

310
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.361
<v Speaker 3>potential energy accounting as well as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the realized violence and also </v>

311
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 3>understanding that the nature of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>income inequality and um,</v>

312
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.790
<v Speaker 3>differential access to financial markets</v>
<v Speaker 3>and technology is creating a lot of very</v>

313
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:41.981
<v Speaker 3>justifiable concern that the post World </v>
<v Speaker 3>War II stability it is constantly in </v>

314
00:16:43.551 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 3>jeopardy and we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I personally think we should think about</v>

315
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.180
<v Speaker 3>once every five years above ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear tests to remind ourselves of </v>

316
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.260
<v Speaker 3>what it is that we've pushed underground</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we haven't seen for years because we</v>

317
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:59.210
<v Speaker 3>are engaged in some kind of magical </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking that the world is fairly stable</v>

318
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 3>and that can turn on a dime.</v>

319
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.340
<v Speaker 3>So what kind of out do you think we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could for this crew of journalists that </v>

320
00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:09.620
<v Speaker 3>were talking about that we want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing more journalism.</v>

321
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:12.140
<v Speaker 3>We don't want them to be attacked or any</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those things.</v>

322
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the out?</v>

323
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:15.670
<v Speaker 3>So the I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can give.</v>

324
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 3>You could fund them in a way that gives </v>
<v Speaker 3>them a little more breathing room,</v>

325
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:20.480
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that I'm seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're on tour is p,</v>

326
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 3>everyone that comes up to me after says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

327
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:24.890
<v Speaker 3>you just gave us a little room to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

328
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.820
<v Speaker 3>so is there a way we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of beating these journalists,</v>

329
00:17:28.821 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 3>instead of getting the wind where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>crush them so that they are losers,</v>

330
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 3>what's the way that we can give them </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a little.</v>

331
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>

332
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:41.060
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of standard behavioral </v>

333
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:41.060
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some senses.</v>

334
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.580
<v Speaker 3>This is something that was established </v>
<v Speaker 3>by skinner a long while back even though</v>

335
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:48.581
<v Speaker 3>he used threaten punishment as ways of </v>
<v Speaker 3>altering the behavior of his </v>

336
00:17:48.581 --> 00:17:49.800
<v Speaker 3>experimental animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He also used reward</v>

337
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 2>but rewards a lot harder to use because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you have to do is you have to watch</v>

338
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.660
<v Speaker 2>very carefully and then when you see an </v>
<v Speaker 2>increment in the behavior that you want </v>

339
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 2>to want to promote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to reward it,</v>

340
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 2>but it requires a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tension and subtle attention.</v>

341
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:07.080
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly do,</v>

342
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:10.440
<v Speaker 2>and that I've been trying to do to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree with my twitter account is to,</v>

343
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.040
<v Speaker 2>is to distribute good news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good credible news and good journalism </v>

344
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:21.201
<v Speaker 2>when I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is partly why I started to get </v>

345
00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:21.201
<v Speaker 2>engaged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say with Colette,</v>

346
00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:22.470
<v Speaker 2>because I think they're doing a credible</v>
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>

347
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.920
<v Speaker 2>but one possibility is to distribute </v>
<v Speaker 2>those pieces that seem to be </v>

348
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:35.150
<v Speaker 2>increasingly reasonable and another is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to also leaped to the defense of people </v>

349
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.951
<v Speaker 2>when they're taken out as individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because one of the things that's </v>

350
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:45.261
<v Speaker 2>happening now is that when an individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>stands up and says something especially </v>

351
00:18:45.261 --> 00:18:49.341
<v Speaker 2>that annoys the radical left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they tend to get mobbed and </v>

352
00:18:49.341 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 2>taken out and that's a bad thing.</v>

353
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 2>It would be good if we could figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways of defending people against that.</v>

354
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:58.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brett has been defended to some degree </v>

355
00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.040
<v Speaker 2>by the emergence of this group of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

356
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.280
<v Speaker 2>that Eric has been describing as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual dark web.</v>

357
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.620
<v Speaker 2>And so there is some strength in numbers</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that might be usefully applied.</v>

358
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Can you just quickly talk about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just on the personal level,</v>

359
00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:15.471
<v Speaker 2>because I think one of the most moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I've heard on this show is </v>

360
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:15.471
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

361
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I had you on and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was with bread and you said </v>

362
00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.060
<v Speaker 2>that standing with him was really one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most validating things that you've </v>

363
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:27.171
<v Speaker 2>ever done in your life and it's such an </v>
<v Speaker 2>example of what you've been talking </v>

364
00:19:27.171 --> 00:19:29.580
<v Speaker 2>about on the tour that if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fix the world than fix yourself a little</v>

365
00:19:29.581 --> 00:19:34.581
<v Speaker 2>bit and then the more that you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might start effecting things around </v>

366
00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:34.581
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's by,</v>

367
00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:38.220
<v Speaker 2>by helping your brother in this case you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were sorta helping the world.</v>

368
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

369
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

370
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.990
<v Speaker 3>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the returns to me,</v>

371
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:53.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were high and has nothing to do with </v>

372
00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:53.880
<v Speaker 3>follower counts on twitter or anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

373
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

374
00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.560
<v Speaker 3>we should talk about positive models of </v>
<v Speaker 3>masculinity and I'm standing shoulder to</v>

375
00:20:04.251 --> 00:20:09.251
<v Speaker 3>shoulder with somebody in a fight is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>important part of what it means to be </v>

376
00:20:09.561 --> 00:20:14.561
<v Speaker 3>complete in a masculine sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that we are all incentivized</v>

377
00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:20.040
<v Speaker 3>by shows like survivor or the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>contest or whatever,</v>

378
00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:25.041
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they do the promos with the </v>

379
00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:26.030
<v Speaker 3>contestants on these shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not here to make friends.</v>

380
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

381
00:20:27.831 --> 00:20:31.690
<v Speaker 3>well what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's corporate America teaching us how</v>

382
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.430
<v Speaker 3>to stab everyone else in the back on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your way to the top,</v>

383
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.590
<v Speaker 3>which actually doesn't work very well by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>

384
00:20:36.591 --> 00:20:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Didn't work at all right or not for that</v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

385
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.180
<v Speaker 3>If you can't follow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't lead,</v>

386
00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.940
<v Speaker 3>can't make friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't make friends.</v>

387
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.190
<v Speaker 3>You're alone and vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

388
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.800
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe stolen had gotten to the is</v>

389
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 3>the best example of a really malignant </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who managed to kill everybody,</v>

390
00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:58.450
<v Speaker 3>including I think his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's very rare that anybody,</v>

391
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that really what,</v>

392
00:21:00.611 --> 00:21:05.611
<v Speaker 3>what these things are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you have to remember that </v>

393
00:21:05.611 --> 00:21:08.100
<v Speaker 3>fragging is a possibility that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lowest person in your organization can </v>

394
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.720
<v Speaker 3>take you down if they're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

395
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

396
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:15.450
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that what people need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand is that there is this lost </v>

397
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.740
<v Speaker 3>art of standing with somebody that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

398
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:20.460
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent agree with who says </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are like,</v>

399
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are definitely things you do on </v>

400
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.681
<v Speaker 3>stage that I'm not comfortable with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if somebody comes to attack you a </v>

401
00:21:27.681 --> 00:21:28.240
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

402
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.690
<v Speaker 3>I know that all of those points I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring up to you,</v>

403
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>face to face.</v>

404
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.080
<v Speaker 3>I assume it's true in reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this idea of standing with </v>

405
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:37.080
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

406
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.821
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been going down to libertarian </v>

407
00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:41.821
<v Speaker 3>path that I'm uncomfortable with often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somebody says,</v>

408
00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:43.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hash it out publicly and privately,</v>

409
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 3>publicly and privately and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's stuff I'll do privately with</v>

410
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:52.411
<v Speaker 3>you that I won't do publicly because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that it is important to learn how </v>

411
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:56.290
<v Speaker 3>to stand in units because otherwise you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just get picked off.</v>

412
00:21:56.291 --> 00:21:57.100
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

413
00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.500
<v Speaker 3>there's a topic that I want to bring up </v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit later,</v>

414
00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:03.520
<v Speaker 3>which is what do I think the Idw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since you've discussed it gets wrong.</v>

415
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.700
<v Speaker 3>And one thing I think we get wrong is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the tribalism that we keep seeing </v>

416
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:11.920
<v Speaker 3>is so toxic that we decided that we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti tribal.</v>

417
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not the right model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be adaptively tribal and </v>

418
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.610
<v Speaker 3>adaptively individualistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

419
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 3>These things matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Groups matter.</v>

420
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Groups have specialized knowledge very </v>
<v Speaker 3>often,</v>

421
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

422
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.070
<v Speaker 3>my group has certain stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your group has a different.</v>

423
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:28.800
<v Speaker 3>We engage in trade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

424
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.260
<v Speaker 3>it is important to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribalism can be adaptive and so it's </v>

425
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:39.331
<v Speaker 3>very troubling to me that the dumbest </v>
<v Speaker 3>voices on the other side are causing us </v>

426
00:22:40.601 --> 00:22:44.770
<v Speaker 3>to overreact too simplistically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So standing with my brother.</v>

427
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason that people say he's </v>

428
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.441
<v Speaker 3>like a brother to me because it means </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you will put yourself at great </v>

429
00:22:52.441 --> 00:22:52.441
<v Speaker 3>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

430
00:22:52.441 --> 00:22:56.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've taken a lot of slings and arrows </v>

431
00:22:56.851 --> 00:22:56.851
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Brett,</v>

432
00:22:56.851 --> 00:22:58.570
<v Speaker 3>and there's a pleasure in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say that it didn't lead</v>

433
00:22:58.571 --> 00:23:01.990
<v Speaker 3>to sleepless nights and that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>worry about friends that I've lost,</v>

434
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

435
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:08.341
<v Speaker 3>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good to know and people respond </v>

436
00:23:08.341 --> 00:23:10.210
<v Speaker 3>positively because it's in our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in our makeup to to say,</v>

437
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:11.890
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy didn't run from a fight.</v>

438
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.760
<v Speaker 3>So do we basically have to just model it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out for people in our behavior.</v>

439
00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:20.761
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the New York Times piece came out </v>

440
00:23:20.761 --> 00:23:21.740
<v Speaker 3>on you about three weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the enforced monogamy piece,</v>

441
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.530
<v Speaker 3>now that the author of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

442
00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:25.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even going to mention her name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you want to,</v>

443
00:23:25.371 --> 00:23:28.270
<v Speaker 3>you can go ahead and she sat in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>green room with us,</v>

444
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:31.900
<v Speaker 3>I think on the first night in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was all smiles and friendly.</v>

445
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:37.050
<v Speaker 3>You even said to me how much you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and you introduced me to her and we </v>

446
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:37.050
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

447
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:37.050
<v Speaker 3>we were chatting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

448
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.100
<v Speaker 3>she seemed perfectly pleasant and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lovely.</v>

449
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:44.101
<v Speaker 3>And then of course this piece comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it implies that you're for forced </v>

450
00:23:44.101 --> 00:23:44.140
<v Speaker 3>monogamy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is which money.</v>

451
00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Just explain that real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just do a,</v>

452
00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 3>do a one</v>

453
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 2>minute on what you were taught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The implication was,</v>

454
00:23:49.101 --> 00:23:49.650
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

455
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
<v Speaker 2>and to the degree that this has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say exaggerated in the aftermath </v>

456
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.770
<v Speaker 2>of the piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the implication was that I was promoting</v>

457
00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:59.440
<v Speaker 2>the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

458
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:04.540
<v Speaker 2>perfectly innocent women would be lined </v>
<v Speaker 2>up by the state and distributed en mass </v>

459
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.230
<v Speaker 2>to undeserving males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't be violent.</v>

460
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 2>We've only done that at one show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

461
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

462
00:24:08.631 --> 00:24:09.680
<v Speaker 2>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

463
00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it didn't,</v>

464
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:11.490
<v Speaker 2>it didn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

465
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.860
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

466
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

467
00:24:13.871 --> 00:24:18.871
<v Speaker 2>that was quite curious because that part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the conversation I had with the </v>

468
00:24:18.871 --> 00:24:22.211
<v Speaker 2>journalist lasted probably two minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of what was essentially a two day </v>

469
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:25.190
<v Speaker 2>interview and it was obviously something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that triggered her imagination,</v>

470
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

471
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.260
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that she saw that she could</v>
<v Speaker 2>use it for,</v>

472
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

473
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 2>for political purposes or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the piece,</v>

474
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.950
<v Speaker 2>but it was so palpably absurd because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

475
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.040
<v Speaker 2>and I would say amateurish in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well because the position that she </v>

476
00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.310
<v Speaker 2>accused me of holding a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

477
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hold so that that's the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

478
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.560
<v Speaker 2>B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one holds.</v>

479
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.780
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're going to try to pillory </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in a manner that's at least </v>

480
00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 2>vaguely believable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should accuse them of holding a view</v>

481
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 2>that at least some person has held at </v>
<v Speaker 2>some point and no one has ever held that</v>

482
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.990
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing that was quite </v>

483
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Speaker 2>off putting let's say is that she's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

484
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.940
<v Speaker 2>She knew perfectly well what I meant by </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforced monogamy by the term.</v>

485
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 2>It's an anthropological term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been used for a hundred years and </v>

486
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.051
<v Speaker 2>the idea that polygamous societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be the contrast say to </v>

487
00:25:20.051 --> 00:25:21.770
<v Speaker 2>monogamous society is the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are more violent,</v>

488
00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:24.030
<v Speaker 2>is no one disputes that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

489
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an anthropological,</v>

490
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:29.660
<v Speaker 2>sociological and psychological truism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also one that's been.</v>

491
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the left has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting polygamy,</v>

492
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

493
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.600
<v Speaker 2>so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

494
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.340
<v Speaker 2>well the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

495
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.090
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

496
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:42.080
<v Speaker 2>the article uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprised me to say the least,</v>

497
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.930
<v Speaker 2>but you made an interesting move</v>

498
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.090
<v Speaker 3>after that which ties this all together </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you did a little checking on the</v>

499
00:25:47.091 --> 00:25:49.670
<v Speaker 3>phrase in the Archives of the New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>Times.</v>

500
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:54.790
<v Speaker 3>And the whole point to me was if I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>take Jordan out of the equation and I </v>

501
00:25:55.731 --> 00:25:59.090
<v Speaker 3>could make it into the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling with itself.</v>

502
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty sure that the New York </v>

503
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.540
<v Speaker 3>Times would have some record of having </v>
<v Speaker 3>used the phrase enforced monogamy at </v>

504
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.260
<v Speaker 3>some point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I went to the search engine and I</v>

505
00:26:09.261 --> 00:26:12.050
<v Speaker 3>put in quote enforcement Origami close </v>
<v Speaker 3>quote.</v>

506
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.260
<v Speaker 3>And sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were two relatively recent </v>

507
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:17.260
<v Speaker 3>references within the last 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 years,</v>

508
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 3>both of them positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

509
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:24.970
<v Speaker 3>I believe coming out of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory in drosophila where it's a less </v>

510
00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:29.801
<v Speaker 3>common term and evolutionary theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it has leaked into the evolutionary </v>

511
00:26:29.801 --> 00:26:34.001
<v Speaker 3>literature and the other one coming from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan where you have polygamous </v>

512
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.660
<v Speaker 3>marriage and that leaves too many </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent young men with nothing to do.</v>

513
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 3>And that can be useful if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>conquesting other lands,</v>

514
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

515
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:43.300
<v Speaker 3>you have no wife here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a,</v>

516
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.320
<v Speaker 3>there's territory over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is exactly,</v>

517
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:51.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the New York Times was celebrating the </v>

518
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.830
<v Speaker 3>idea that in a culture that was at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage in its evolution,</v>

519
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:58.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enforcement origami was something that </v>

520
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.130
<v Speaker 3>went hand in hand with women's rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of course,</v>

521
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:03.140
<v Speaker 3>having the classic art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you having fewer violent men with no </v>

522
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 3>romantic prospects is in general good </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the safety of women.</v>

523
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.910
<v Speaker 3>And so the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is actually my point,</v>

524
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 3>but the point was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I take Jordan out of it and say the </v>

525
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.950
<v Speaker 3>New York Times is wrestling with itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not unfairly.</v>

526
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.010
<v Speaker 3>And this is the great danger is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that finger is on the scale.</v>

527
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:25.011
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is that that particular </v>

528
00:27:25.011 --> 00:27:25.011
<v Speaker 3>journalist first met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

529
00:27:25.011 --> 00:27:29.420
<v Speaker 3>was talking with Brett.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm well before talking with you and </v>

530
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.180
<v Speaker 3>then Brett set this journalist to me.</v>

531
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:35.510
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that we should not talk </v>

532
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.731
<v Speaker 3>about the name of the journalist and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalist is certainly using your name </v>

533
00:27:37.731 --> 00:27:38.490
<v Speaker 3>and the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's Nellie Bowles.</v>

534
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.170
<v Speaker 3>And I found her engaging and charming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very quick,</v>

535
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.200
<v Speaker 3>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that I didn't appreciate and </v>

536
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.590
<v Speaker 3>they got fairly far into my discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>with her and I was off the record,</v>

537
00:27:50.591 --> 00:27:52.110
<v Speaker 3>is she began with the gambit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

538
00:27:52.111 --> 00:27:54.570
<v Speaker 3>of course I'm going to be running your </v>
<v Speaker 3>tweet on James Damore,</v>

539
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.700
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

540
00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:01.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went viral and was widely </v>

541
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.310
<v Speaker 3>misinterpreted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

542
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:05.481
<v Speaker 3>in a deliberate fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which my tweet was responding to </v>

543
00:28:05.481 --> 00:28:05.481
<v Speaker 3>somebody saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

544
00:28:05.481 --> 00:28:08.550
<v Speaker 3>if human resources that somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Google tweeted,</v>

545
00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:10.740
<v Speaker 3>if human resources won't do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

546
00:28:10.741 --> 00:28:15.741
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have trouble on their </v>

547
00:28:15.741 --> 00:28:15.741
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

548
00:28:15.741 --> 00:28:18.771
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're telling people to run to human </v>

549
00:28:18.771 --> 00:28:18.771
<v Speaker 3>resources because James Demore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

550
00:28:18.771 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 3>is looking at big five psychometrics for</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality and asking the question,</v>

551
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:27.711
<v Speaker 3>how do we increase the accessibility of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Google to female coders and whether you </v>

552
00:28:28.261 --> 00:28:29.850
<v Speaker 3>agree with his technique or not.</v>

553
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that was clearly his point.</v>

554
00:28:32.281 --> 00:28:37.281
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is I'm going to bring up </v>
<v Speaker 3>this tweet that has been widely </v>

555
00:28:37.281 --> 00:28:38.520
<v Speaker 3>mischaracterized of yours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric,</v>

556
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.880
<v Speaker 3>and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what became clear was she had the idea </v>

557
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.771
<v Speaker 3>that you wanted to find the men's rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>activist community and you know,</v>

558
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 3>she said something about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

559
00:28:51.421 --> 00:28:55.350
<v Speaker 3>your Mra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't even know what that meant.</v>

560
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:56.880
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>NRA,</v>

561
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.480
<v Speaker 3>National Rifle Association.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

562
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:01.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men's rights activists.</v>

563
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.040
<v Speaker 3>I said what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we had this.</v>

564
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Well that was just you being </v>
<v Speaker 3>disingenuous because of course,</v>

565
00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:09.100
<v Speaker 3>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men's rights activists are right.</v>

566
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.770
<v Speaker 3>But the point would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

567
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:15.810
<v Speaker 3>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you believe in human rights.</v>

568
00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:17.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

569
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:22.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men are human so you believe in men's </v>

570
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.190
<v Speaker 3>rights and you believe that one should </v>
<v Speaker 3>be active,</v>

571
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

572
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:27.550
<v Speaker 3>at some level it's a reserved term for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are very often kind of </v>

573
00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:32.120
<v Speaker 3>veering a spectrum of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about bad aspects of family law </v>

574
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.430
<v Speaker 3>versus people who are downright </v>
<v Speaker 3>misogynist.</v>

575
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.180
<v Speaker 3>And I was just aghast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>

576
00:29:39.181 --> 00:29:43.570
<v Speaker 3>why are you trying to shoehorn me into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this preexisting thing?</v>

577
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.090
<v Speaker 3>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The motivation for the,</v>

578
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.720
<v Speaker 3>for the shoe horning and well this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the big issue coming,</v>

579
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to track all the threads.</v>

580
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:56.611
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just get back to what we don't </v>

581
00:29:56.611 --> 00:29:58.660
<v Speaker 3>understand is that they've invested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this cognitive Lego,</v>

582
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they've,</v>

583
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:05.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>equity or toxic masculinity or white </v>

584
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.970
<v Speaker 3>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever these things are.</v>

585
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.420
<v Speaker 3>And so everything in high dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 3>space gets shoved into this completely </v>

586
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:17.680
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate kind of cognitive lego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which furthermore,</v>

587
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.910
<v Speaker 3>the format of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I recently got asked to do a bit on</v>

588
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:23.590
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a show on television,</v>

589
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:26.380
<v Speaker 3>on an established network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

590
00:30:26.381 --> 00:30:27.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're really blowing it out.</v>

591
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:28.330
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

592
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.200
<v Speaker 3>we've got the message that this new form</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a long form interview,</v>

593
00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the wave of the future.</v>

594
00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:34.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

595
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 3>how much am I going to get?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might go from five to eight minutes,</v>

596
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:43.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is I want to say hello in five </v>

597
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.080
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the point,</v>

598
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.941
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I have access to three hours </v>

599
00:30:47.941 --> 00:30:47.941
<v Speaker 3>when I want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

600
00:30:47.941 --> 00:30:47.941
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

601
00:30:47.941 --> 00:30:47.941
<v Speaker 3>that's insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

602
00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:53.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like they can't move that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's partly why the formats </v>

603
00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.370
<v Speaker 3>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also,</v>

604
00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the reasons that we think</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're stupid or than we are.</v>

605
00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I like listening to a lot of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including our audience is that,</v>

606
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because tv,</v>

607
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:07.080
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I have noticed about </v>
<v Speaker 3>television in general is that it's </v>

608
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.100
<v Speaker 3>predicated on the presumption that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience is stupid,</v>

609
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:14.490
<v Speaker 3>but if you have to force everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>through a channel whose maximum </v>

610
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:16.820
<v Speaker 3>dimension is six minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then everyone's going to look was.</v>

611
00:31:16.821 --> 00:31:21.520
<v Speaker 3>The stupid thing is if you think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened where television went from</v>

612
00:31:21.521 --> 00:31:26.521
<v Speaker 3>being the dumb medium to the incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart medium when you went from TV </v>

613
00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:32.710
<v Speaker 3>dramas have a half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe an hour in length to many,</v>

614
00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:37.711
<v Speaker 3>many shows over a season and developing </v>
<v Speaker 3>characters at a level that a film can't </v>

615
00:31:37.711 --> 00:31:39.990
<v Speaker 3>touch literature approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

616
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

617
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.320
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that in the sopranos or </v>
<v Speaker 3>mad men or game of thrones,</v>

618
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:49.590
<v Speaker 3>people are following incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult enrich plots and you have to </v>

619
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:54.451
<v Speaker 3>go back to this old adage which nobody </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever lost a dime a underestimating the </v>

620
00:31:54.451 --> 00:31:55.570
<v Speaker 3>intelligence of the American people.</v>

621
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's only true if you don't understand</v>

622
00:31:58.091 --> 00:32:01.090
<v Speaker 3>opportunity cost because people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been losing dimes,</v>

623
00:32:01.091 --> 00:32:06.091
<v Speaker 3>but millions by not understanding that </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone who can follow game of thrones,</v>

624
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is it that this thing that we're </v>

625
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:12.120
<v Speaker 3>about to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea why.</v>

626
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:12.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just having a conversation.</v>

627
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.920
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be over 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>views of this thing.</v>

628
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 3>I think very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

629
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I got one video on my channel of any </v>
<v Speaker 3>substance,</v>

630
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.990
<v Speaker 3>one video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got nearly 60,000</v>

631
00:32:22.991 --> 00:32:27.991
<v Speaker 3>views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are hungry for this thing that </v>

632
00:32:27.991 --> 00:32:31.041
<v Speaker 3>they're being starved for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they don't understand in the </v>

633
00:32:31.041 --> 00:32:34.501
<v Speaker 3>regular media is is that their format is</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing them and I know this is </v>

634
00:32:34.501 --> 00:32:39.271
<v Speaker 3>something we really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really have to pay attention to it </v>

635
00:32:39.271 --> 00:32:40.700
<v Speaker 3>because a tremendous amount of what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on is the consequence.</v>

636
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said that a complex reality is being</v>

637
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:45.030
<v Speaker 2>shoveled into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

638
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.860
<v Speaker 2>a tiny dimensional space and so there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some ideological reasons for that,</v>

639
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.570
<v Speaker 2>but I think some of that is being fed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the channels of the media because it's a</v>

640
00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:58.571
<v Speaker 2>lot easier to take a complex situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and shovel it into a </v>

641
00:32:58.571 --> 00:33:02.150
<v Speaker 2>preexisting April interpretive space </v>
<v Speaker 2>because everyone already understands it.</v>

642
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.600
<v Speaker 2>So if you've only got a few minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's a bunch of things that you </v>

643
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.830
<v Speaker 2>don't have to explain because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just telling the same old story.</v>

644
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Because what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

645
00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 2>what we also don't grasp</v>

646
00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.510
<v Speaker 3>is that we don't file flight plans like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're having me on the show.</v>

647
00:33:16.511 --> 00:33:18.010
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm going to say.</v>

648
00:33:18.011 --> 00:33:19.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what my positions are on </v>
<v Speaker 3>immigration.</v>

649
00:33:19.901 --> 00:33:21.490
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what my physicians are an</v>
<v Speaker 3>abortion.</v>

650
00:33:21.491 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 3>We've never gotten to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

651
00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.510
<v Speaker 3>and I was actually thinking that about </v>
<v Speaker 3>both of you.</v>

652
00:33:25.511 --> 00:33:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we've ever discussed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't get it,</v>

653
00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.270
<v Speaker 3>but what the way the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

654
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:36.300
<v Speaker 3>this commentary at works and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>waking up to the idea that the slayer </v>

655
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.870
<v Speaker 3>even exists because they didn't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it too much,</v>

656
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:43.350
<v Speaker 3>is that mostly these people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent takes that is they are </v>

657
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:46.980
<v Speaker 3>counted upon to take complicated reality</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

658
00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.450
<v Speaker 3>give us the Tom Friedman point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give us the,</v>

659
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 3>give us the Paul Krugman point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

660
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.670
<v Speaker 3>give us the Ezra Klein view and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

661
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is there a sort of regular,</v>

662
00:33:58.001 --> 00:34:00.870
<v Speaker 3>consistent view on these things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

663
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.880
<v Speaker 3>I've watched Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched you change your mind in </v>

664
00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.221
<v Speaker 3>real time as somebody makes a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument and it's a little bit painful </v>

665
00:34:08.221 --> 00:34:08.221
<v Speaker 3>because somebody was listening to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they say,</v>

666
00:34:08.221 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I have faith in your argument?</v>

667
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:12.250
<v Speaker 3>And that might answer is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith in any of this stuff?</v>

668
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.620
<v Speaker 3>All of this stuff can reverse it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Won't you have more faith?</v>

669
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:19.830
<v Speaker 3>If somebody can reverse themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm thinking about this thing about </v>

670
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:20.900
<v Speaker 3>the the cake baking a cake for a gay.</v>

671
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

672
00:34:21.851 --> 00:34:26.851
<v Speaker 2>Well look what happened when we'll get </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to nellie bowles because I want to </v>

673
00:34:26.851 --> 00:34:27.280
<v Speaker 2>return to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

674
00:34:27.281 --> 00:34:30.460
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting to watch in Vancouver,</v>

675
00:34:30.461 --> 00:34:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I just had two discussions with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris and the.</v>

676
00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:38.910
<v Speaker 2>The discussion was set up from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>promotional perspective by a promoter </v>

677
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.710
<v Speaker 2>who was doing his job as a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat situation,</v>

678
00:34:41.711 --> 00:34:42.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was going to be a victory.</v>

679
00:34:42.881 --> 00:34:46.450
<v Speaker 2>It would be sam or me in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the final analysis versus it actually</v>

680
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.740
<v Speaker 2>versus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

681
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.800
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what happened was that Sam and I </v>

682
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.610
<v Speaker 2>actually had a discussion where we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to lay out our points to </v>

683
00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:57.490
<v Speaker 2>understand each other's points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we set this up.</v>

684
00:34:57.491 --> 00:35:01.510
<v Speaker 2>It was one of Brett's ideas actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your brother a moderated.</v>

685
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:07.200
<v Speaker 2>When the second discussion opened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he had us do was summarize each </v>

686
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:07.200
<v Speaker 2>other's arguments.</v>

687
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.820
<v Speaker 2>So I put forth Sam's arguments in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongest possible terms.</v>

688
00:35:09.821 --> 00:35:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Steel man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did the same and that worked.</v>

689
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:16.890
<v Speaker 2>That worked just fine by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was so interesting was the </v>

690
00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:20.791
<v Speaker 2>audience would have settled for a debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>that culminated in the victory of one of</v>

691
00:35:21.251 --> 00:35:26.251
<v Speaker 2>us over the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But instead what happened was they got </v>

692
00:35:26.251 --> 00:35:29.941
<v Speaker 2>engaged in a discussion that we had both</v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to push both of our </v>

693
00:35:29.941 --> 00:35:32.680
<v Speaker 2>capabilities of thinking farther along </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

694
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:38.110
<v Speaker 2>and we weren't sure if that would work </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we weren't sure if we could </v>

695
00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.471
<v Speaker 2>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it turned out that we could partly </v>

696
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:42.681
<v Speaker 2>thanks to breads help and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original format was we were going to </v>

697
00:35:42.681 --> 00:35:46.551
<v Speaker 2>talk for an hour for the first one and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're going to open it up to q and </v>

698
00:35:46.551 --> 00:35:49.521
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the discussion got very intense and </v>

699
00:35:49.521 --> 00:35:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I likened it to approximate level of a </v>

700
00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:52.660
<v Speaker 2>pretty good phd defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

701
00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:53.550
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

702
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 2>if you have a good student who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's defending and you know,</v>

703
00:35:57.091 --> 00:36:02.091
<v Speaker 2>they know the literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can really go after them because it </v>

704
00:36:02.091 --> 00:36:02.091
<v Speaker 2>gives them a chance to show their </v>
<v Speaker 2>mastery.</v>

705
00:36:02.091 --> 00:36:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it can be a real positive thing for </v>

706
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was like a dual phd defense,</v>

707
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 2>D U,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a l and D u e l at the same time,</v>

708
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.440
<v Speaker 2>but the audience was right there with us</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then at the end of the hour,</v>

709
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Brett asked them should we switch to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>q and a or should we continue the </v>

710
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.530
<v Speaker 2>discussion because we're in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of something.</v>

711
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:23.361
<v Speaker 2>And overwhelmingly the sentiment was </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue the discussion and so we did </v>

712
00:36:23.361 --> 00:36:28.191
<v Speaker 2>model the process of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say respectful dialogue </v>

713
00:36:28.191 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 2>because first of all that's a cliche and</v>
<v Speaker 2>second of all,</v>

714
00:36:29.551 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't what this was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we were doing was actually engaging</v>

715
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:37.260
<v Speaker 2>in the process of trying to make both of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us smarter than we were.</v>

716
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:42.150
<v Speaker 2>And and people are are in for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there,</v>

717
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:47.180
<v Speaker 2>they're onboard for that and they would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would prefer that to the cheap </v>

718
00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:47.180
<v Speaker 2>victory by all appearances.</v>

719
00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.950
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think that says then if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the audience that was there and </v>

720
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:56.151
<v Speaker 2>from what I can see with our audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they care more about an unlocking </v>

721
00:36:57.631 --> 00:37:00.270
<v Speaker 2>some truths than they do about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>victory.</v>

722
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 2>When we live in a time where everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to dunk on everybody constantly,</v>

723
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I keep seeing the phrase pop up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get you a dunk.</v>

724
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Dinah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't.</v>

725
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.590
<v Speaker 2>That's nobody wants it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they keep shuttling,</v>

726
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:12.050
<v Speaker 2>loves he wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

727
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:17.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better than being bored and it's </v>

728
00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:17.090
<v Speaker 2>better than stacy's and it's better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitulation,</v>

729
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as good as what could be if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got what was optimal.</v>

730
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.970
<v Speaker 2>When I see this with my own videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people keep chopping them up and say,</v>

731
00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson demolishes,</v>

732
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.850
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's click bait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was also one of the things that</v>

733
00:37:29.851 --> 00:37:33.750
<v Speaker 2>made me think about the degeneracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>degeneration of journalism per se,</v>

734
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:38.751
<v Speaker 2>and to Bait clickbait mean that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerging spontaneously on youtube as a </v>

735
00:37:38.751 --> 00:37:40.260
<v Speaker 2>method for attracting attention and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

736
00:37:40.261 --> 00:37:41.790
<v Speaker 2>as they get more desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as their,</v>

737
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:45.270
<v Speaker 2>as their modality dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not surprising that they,</v>

738
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>that they turn to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>oversimplifications for the reasons you </v>

739
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:54.501
<v Speaker 2>outlined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to attract attention real </v>

740
00:37:54.501 --> 00:37:54.501
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

741
00:37:54.501 --> 00:37:54.501
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible that it worked for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile,</v>

742
00:37:54.501 --> 00:37:58.140
<v Speaker 2>that that sort of exposure and clickbait</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense made sense?</v>

743
00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Sort of at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

744
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:03.760
<v Speaker 2>because we were all so stuck in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

745
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:07.080
<v Speaker 2>in the old structures that we needed </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to really wake us up,</v>

746
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:12.320
<v Speaker 2>but now we're sort of past that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think so that we don't think </v>

747
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:12.320
<v Speaker 2>we're past it enough that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work anymore.</v>

748
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.330
<v Speaker 2>If you want to avoid having me as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guest in the future,</v>

749
00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:20.331
<v Speaker 2>here's one of the standard moves that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>may stop talking about what's good and </v>

750
00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:23.361
<v Speaker 2>bad and started putting the phrase </v>
<v Speaker 2>adaptive and maladaptive in front of </v>

751
00:38:23.361 --> 00:38:24.750
<v Speaker 2>different modalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We like adaptive dumb dunking.</v>

752
00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.540
<v Speaker 2>I've got this problem with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Noah Smith.</v>

753
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:29.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what his problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

754
00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:33.480
<v Speaker 2>he's an economist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's engaging.</v>

755
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 2>He's a relatively</v>

756
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.980
<v Speaker 3>charming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has got a position on immigration </v>

757
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 3>where he just loves immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>

758
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:46.050
<v Speaker 3>You can't have too much immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Immigration is just the best thing in </v>

759
00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:48.601
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it has some problems in some </v>

760
00:38:48.601 --> 00:38:50.701
<v Speaker 3>sector,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in general it's a free lunch and </v>

761
00:38:50.701 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 3>I've done work on this to try to show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

762
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:56.821
<v Speaker 3>It's a much more complicated situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and behind the scenes it's being abused </v>

763
00:38:56.821 --> 00:39:01.530
<v Speaker 3>as has nothing to do with immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Americans transferring wealth into </v>

764
00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 3>their own pockets from other Americans </v>
<v Speaker 3>using immigrants.</v>

765
00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 3>We can get into this later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried,</v>

766
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:09.880
<v Speaker 3>I've had lunch with the guy I've shown </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my papers,</v>

767
00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:14.881
<v Speaker 3>my research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He absolutely does not want a </v>

768
00:39:14.881 --> 00:39:16.540
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does he want?</v>

769
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants to have an idea that </v>

770
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.470
<v Speaker 3>immigration is a pure good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that know the National Academy of </v>

771
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Sciences has found that if we get this </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit from it and it has to do with </v>

772
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.290
<v Speaker 3>one rights which don't show up in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

773
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.540
<v Speaker 3>in a maximum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an economics framework.</v>

774
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.900
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with something involving </v>
<v Speaker 3>the securitization of rights so that </v>

775
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.460
<v Speaker 3>people don't have their rights taken as </v>
<v Speaker 3>if by eminent domain.</v>

776
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knows all this stuff and he just </v>

777
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:48.500
<v Speaker 3>chooses to continue down this path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that Sam has seen this with Reza,</v>

778
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Reza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aslan,</v>

779
00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with Glenn Greenwald,</v>

780
00:39:53.021 --> 00:39:55.960
<v Speaker 3>who in some ways I always thought of as </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty positive.</v>

781
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.490
<v Speaker 3>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

782
00:39:57.491 --> 00:40:02.491
<v Speaker 3>he gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets a bug in his head and you get </v>

783
00:40:02.491 --> 00:40:06.391
<v Speaker 3>these incredibly negative people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to come into a discussion and</v>

784
00:40:07.151 --> 00:40:12.151
<v Speaker 3>it's important to reserve the dunking on</v>
<v Speaker 3>modality for when people are really not </v>

785
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:16.480
<v Speaker 3>acting as good actors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

786
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:21.970
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of what I did with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided to take a lawsuit out against </v>

787
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Wilfrid laurier two weeks ago and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

788
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

789
00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:28.831
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to reserve my twitter </v>
<v Speaker 3>defense that say or attack because it's </v>

790
00:40:28.931 --> 00:40:31.300
<v Speaker 3>not always easy to distinguish between </v>
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>

791
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

792
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I've learned to leave people alone when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they make untoward comments,</v>

793
00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:42.930
<v Speaker 3>unless they are journalists of some </v>
<v Speaker 3>repute or professors of some repute,</v>

794
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:49.330
<v Speaker 3>in which case I think I have a moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>obligation not to remain silent.</v>

795
00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.020
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not so easy to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you should defend yourself and when</v>

796
00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:58.021
<v Speaker 3>you should shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well first before is the wrong time to </v>

797
00:40:58.021 --> 00:40:58.240
<v Speaker 3>do and prefer that we don't defend </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves because it's,</v>

798
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.370
<v Speaker 3>as you always have this problem with </v>
<v Speaker 3>special pleading,</v>

799
00:41:00.371 --> 00:41:02.530
<v Speaker 3>are you defending yourself because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in the ideas?</v>

800
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:07.740
<v Speaker 3>Are you defending yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's a possible threat to your </v>

801
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:07.740
<v Speaker 3>own reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

802
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.660
<v Speaker 3>So that's one of the reasons I came to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your assistance on the enforcement </v>

803
00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:12.400
<v Speaker 3>origami thing because I didn't want you </v>
<v Speaker 3>having to make that point.</v>

804
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:17.790
<v Speaker 3>And if at some point in the future I get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into trouble and you think that I have </v>

805
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:18.280
<v Speaker 3>married my position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps you'll return the favor.</v>

806
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.050
<v Speaker 3>We can figure out the game theory later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

807
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:25.280
<v Speaker 3>that's what culture actually does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But doesn't that also just feed the </v>

808
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.171
<v Speaker 3>beast in a certain way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you defend a professor goes after </v>

809
00:41:28.171 --> 00:41:28.171
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who has,</v>

810
00:41:28.171 --> 00:41:28.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

811
00:41:28.171 --> 00:41:30.370
<v Speaker 3>no notoriety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just wants to get in on the game.</v>

812
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Well now you've defended yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now next thing you know,</v>

813
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.990
<v Speaker 3>voxer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buzzfeed is writing about the professor.</v>

814
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Jordan Peterson.</v>

815
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a danger for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

816
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:45.670
<v Speaker 3>I am also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am not a huge fan of the dunk on </v>

817
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.641
<v Speaker 3>mentality as a opening gambit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am slow to anger in these situations.</v>

818
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I tend to give people three benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the doubt,</v>

819
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.020
<v Speaker 3>which is what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

820
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

821
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:58.961
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had as recline and his wife over for </v>

822
00:41:58.961 --> 00:42:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Shabbat dinner with Gad said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

823
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the Sam Harris thing,</v>

824
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 3>and I wanted to understand as position </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Ezra had,</v>

825
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:11.110
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vox had done a piece where I talked </v>

826
00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:13.721
<v Speaker 3>about the need to blend hyper capitalism</v>
<v Speaker 3>with hyper socialism in the future </v>

827
00:42:13.721 --> 00:42:14.330
<v Speaker 3>because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and throw up,</v>

828
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:16.610
<v Speaker 3>I think about this thing of anthropic </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism.</v>

829
00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:21.610
<v Speaker 3>The capitalism that worked in the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 3>and 20th centuries may have been an </v>

830
00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:25.331
<v Speaker 3>accident for where the parameters were </v>
<v Speaker 3>set on in our market so that it could </v>

831
00:42:25.331 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 3>function as well as it did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

832
00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Ezra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

833
00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:31.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get into all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal details of the interaction,</v>

834
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:36.340
<v Speaker 3>but it was fascinating talking to Ezra </v>
<v Speaker 3>and his wife as to how they see the </v>

835
00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:40.421
<v Speaker 3>world and getting a behind the scenes </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at what generates vox.</v>

836
00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:46.770
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's very important to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be charitable in understanding other </v>

837
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:49.340
<v Speaker 3>people and understanding their </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivations.</v>

838
00:42:49.341 --> 00:42:51.800
<v Speaker 3>But there is a point when you hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>something three,</v>

839
00:42:51.801 --> 00:42:55.490
<v Speaker 3>four or five times the person's </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidenced comprehension.</v>

840
00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:00.700
<v Speaker 3>And then they go into this mode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you talked about this with Kathy </v>

841
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Newman where you had one kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction with her before and then </v>

842
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:04.210
<v Speaker 3>suddenly somebody three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

843
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:04.210
<v Speaker 3>one go.</v>

844
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.410
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what you're really saying,</v>

845
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.920
<v Speaker 3>where did that personality come out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has to do in part with the masks </v>

846
00:43:12.111 --> 00:43:14.390
<v Speaker 3>that we all put on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that one of the things is,</v>

847
00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:16.970
<v Speaker 3>I know you guys both personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

848
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:22.090
<v Speaker 3>this mirrors it how we talk in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different context.</v>

849
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.250
<v Speaker 3>But when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

850
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.520
<v Speaker 3>when vox is the weeds discussed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual dark web,</v>

851
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was incredibly confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very interestingly,</v>

852
00:43:32.331 --> 00:43:37.331
<v Speaker 3>after the Barry Weiss article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost no one from the standard media </v>

853
00:43:37.331 --> 00:43:39.560
<v Speaker 3>called me up to clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of learn more because barry was the</v>

854
00:43:39.561 --> 00:43:44.561
<v Speaker 3>owner of this thing and so it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumed that barry had named it that </v>

855
00:43:44.561 --> 00:43:47.760
<v Speaker 3>this was barry's beat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so barry was the goto person as if </v>

856
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.820
<v Speaker 3>we were all owned by the particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>member of the commentary.</v>

857
00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:52.430
<v Speaker 3>That who decided to actually blow this </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and make it large?</v>

858
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:57.590
<v Speaker 3>We have to become more charitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that in part,</v>

859
00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:02.890
<v Speaker 3>part of the problem that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>having with the sort of madness in the </v>

860
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.370
<v Speaker 3>progressives is that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unlike the Charlottesville,</v>

861
00:44:04.371 --> 00:44:09.371
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the progressives are in the </v>

862
00:44:09.371 --> 00:44:12.071
<v Speaker 3>establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the Tiki torch holders are like </v>

863
00:44:12.071 --> 00:44:13.880
<v Speaker 3>often their mother's garage and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

864
00:44:13.881 --> 00:44:18.881
<v Speaker 3>big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the reasons were animated </v>

865
00:44:18.881 --> 00:44:18.881
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

866
00:44:18.881 --> 00:44:21.200
<v Speaker 3>you remember that line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's coming from inside the house.</v>

867
00:44:21.201 --> 00:44:23.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's coming from inside the house.</v>

868
00:44:23.181 --> 00:44:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

869
00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:31.060
<v Speaker 3>I do see a lot of points that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have that they're just terribly </v>

870
00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.050
<v Speaker 3>missing stantiating the problem of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressives in my,</v>

871
00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:35.010
<v Speaker 3>in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might have.</v>

872
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Speaker 3>My family has been progressive since the</v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties,</v>

873
00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.530
<v Speaker 3>is that they're terrible at what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

874
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.690
<v Speaker 3>They're just not good progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like really malignant form.</v>

875
00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you an example.</v>

876
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.640
<v Speaker 3>English is odd in that it is inflicted </v>
<v Speaker 3>for gender only in the third person </v>

877
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:56.400
<v Speaker 3>singular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Turkish for example,</v>

878
00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.650
<v Speaker 3>it's not inflected for gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one pronoun.</v>

879
00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Kishi it.</v>

880
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.840
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have this problem in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkish.</v>

881
00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were referring to a character </v>

882
00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:09.320
<v Speaker 3>in the story who is not present,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

883
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:14.690
<v Speaker 3>we had this problem for a in English </v>
<v Speaker 3>form inflicted influxion for marital </v>

884
00:45:15.091 --> 00:45:20.091
<v Speaker 3>status,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was true for females and not </v>

885
00:45:20.091 --> 00:45:20.091
<v Speaker 3>males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Was Mr.</v>

886
00:45:20.091 --> 00:45:21.840
<v Speaker 3>but miss and Mrs gave you more </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

887
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:27.230
<v Speaker 3>So there was a one time backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incompatible change that got made with </v>

888
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.000
<v Speaker 3>ms and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

889
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.970
<v Speaker 3>it's still rankles because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound great,</v>

890
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.720
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was a good idea and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make,</v>

891
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.820
<v Speaker 3>to give women the equality that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>deserved and shouldn't have to ask for.</v>

892
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to actually do the pronoun</v>

893
00:45:40.741 --> 00:45:45.741
<v Speaker 3>thing for English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you start with trans or would you </v>

894
00:45:45.741 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 3>start with intersects now?</v>

895
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:51.170
<v Speaker 3>If you started with intersects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone is intellectually sympathetic </v>

896
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:55.580
<v Speaker 3>with Intersex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people whose gender or sex is </v>

897
00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.170
<v Speaker 3>ambiguous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

898
00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Because of the way in which development </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of takes female and turns it into </v>

899
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.640
<v Speaker 3>mail if the SROI protein is present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

900
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:05.630
<v Speaker 3>everyone who understands this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to be clear,</v>

901
00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:08.520
<v Speaker 3>not everyone who hears about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everyone who has in general,</v>

902
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:13.550
<v Speaker 3>no matter how conservative somebody is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I tell them there's a person born </v>

903
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.570
<v Speaker 3>with ambiguous genitalia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

904
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.180
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got an Sroi protein,</v>

905
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.260
<v Speaker 3>a on an x chromosome or they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>malfunctioning one on a why,</v>

906
00:46:22.261 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 3>so that they appear to be the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenotype for their genotype.</v>

907
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.030
<v Speaker 3>There's compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The person was born in Seoul,</v>

908
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:34.040
<v Speaker 3>was born without the expected assignment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no question about </v>

909
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.210
<v Speaker 3>development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And should we be steering.</v>

910
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.940
<v Speaker 3>You should be more male.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be more masculine,</v>

911
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.270
<v Speaker 3>more feminine in order to avoid the sky </v>
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>

912
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A temptations for people who feel that </v>

913
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:49.800
<v Speaker 3>they are one thing well evidencing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are something else in the physical.</v>

914
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would make the change based on </v>

915
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.011
<v Speaker 3>intersects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd make a onetime backwards </v>

916
00:46:58.011 --> 00:47:00.351
<v Speaker 3>incompatible change to the language with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a approach pronoun like Turkish has.</v>

917
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.240
<v Speaker 3>And then trans would have what it wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>without this craziness of everybody gets</v>

918
00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:10.260
<v Speaker 3>to design their own personal pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a disaster.</v>

919
00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Like in a computer science course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would never allow people,</v>

920
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:18.290
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd give them a choice so that the </v>

921
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.290
<v Speaker 3>coding can go through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can't have their own pronouns.</v>

922
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's how you do it.</v>

923
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.220
<v Speaker 3>And if you wanted it to win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how you push it through.</v>

924
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Now what they want is something else </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to say something like Trans </v>

925
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Women are no less women than women who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are born biologically female.</v>

926
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not true,</v>

927
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

928
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.980
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the case that every single </v>

929
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.951
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every traditional culture of which I'm </v>

930
00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:47.200
<v Speaker 3>aware there is gender ambiguity in South</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sulawesi.</v>

931
00:47:47.201 --> 00:47:49.990
<v Speaker 3>You have a priestly class from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In India,</v>

932
00:47:49.991 --> 00:47:51.820
<v Speaker 3>you have the hidden cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

933
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:54.570
<v Speaker 3>Turkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>national treasure,</v>

934
00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 3>a Zeki Muren was more feminine than </v>
<v Speaker 3>Liberace.</v>

935
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:03.450
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just came from Italy where the Uffizi </v>

936
00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:06.570
<v Speaker 3>Gallery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an entire room called the </v>

937
00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:06.570
<v Speaker 3>hermaphrodite room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dedicated to a beautiful statue,</v>

938
00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

939
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ostensibly female,</v>

940
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:14.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recumbent a model with a male genitalia </v>

941
00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:14.840
<v Speaker 3>that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

942
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:20.820
<v Speaker 3>not the Shah of Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ayatollah in Iran came out with a </v>

943
00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 3>proclamation that it was okay to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>gender reassignment surgery.</v>

944
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.800
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like traditional cultures </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know about this,</v>

945
00:48:26.801 --> 00:48:28.480
<v Speaker 3>it's not like we haven't made </v>
<v Speaker 3>accommodation,</v>

946
00:48:28.481 --> 00:48:33.481
<v Speaker 3>it's always been an issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the [inaudible] and in </v>

947
00:48:33.481 --> 00:48:33.481
<v Speaker 3>Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

948
00:48:33.481 --> 00:48:38.280
<v Speaker 3>which are among the best spoken in most </v>
<v Speaker 3>educated people that you meet as a </v>

949
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:38.280
<v Speaker 3>traveler.</v>

950
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 3>The issue is that we somehow wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a wedge issue out of this.</v>

951
00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I am going to force you to say things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that aren't true as an evidence of my </v>

952
00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:47.530
<v Speaker 3>power as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

953
00:48:47.531 --> 00:48:52.531
<v Speaker 3>that's why exactly why I oppose the </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation in Canada to begin with </v>

954
00:48:52.531 --> 00:48:54.610
<v Speaker 3>because part and parcel what came along </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that as part and parcel of it,</v>

955
00:48:54.611 --> 00:48:59.611
<v Speaker 3>and this was no accident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was illegal insistence that gender </v>

956
00:48:59.611 --> 00:49:02.260
<v Speaker 3>differences were associated associate </v>
<v Speaker 3>socio culturally constructed.</v>

957
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:03.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they're not.</v>

958
00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:04.720
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

959
00:49:04.721 --> 00:49:09.721
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are we enshrining that viewpoint </v>

960
00:49:09.721 --> 00:49:09.721
<v Speaker 3>into law?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

961
00:49:09.721 --> 00:49:13.021
<v Speaker 3>that's not to say that gender doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very gender expression doesn't vary </v>

962
00:49:13.021 --> 00:49:15.880
<v Speaker 3>substantially because of sociocultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions because you have to be a fool</v>

963
00:49:15.881 --> 00:49:20.881
<v Speaker 3>not to see that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's another situation where the </v>

964
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:26.050
<v Speaker 3>multidimensional complexity seems to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exceed the processing capacity of the </v>

965
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:26.260
<v Speaker 3>ideologues.</v>

966
00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.030
<v Speaker 3>Is that there's more than one factory </v>
<v Speaker 3>work?</v>

967
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:28.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

968
00:49:28.351 --> 00:49:29.560
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know what they're doing.</v>

969
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should a skirt be seen as feminine or </v>

970
00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:34.960
<v Speaker 3>masculine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

971
00:49:34.961 --> 00:49:39.961
<v Speaker 3>we know from India where the lung is </v>
<v Speaker 3>popular for Scotland where there's a </v>

972
00:49:39.961 --> 00:49:41.830
<v Speaker 3>kilt that this is a variable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

973
00:49:41.831 --> 00:49:44.410
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't hardcode skirts are for </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls.</v>

974
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is that there is a huge </v>

975
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:51.811
<v Speaker 3>developmental aspect to learning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here are the assignments in your </v>

976
00:49:51.811 --> 00:49:56.551
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now at some point you want to steer </v>

977
00:49:56.551 --> 00:50:00.270
<v Speaker 3>people into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a huge interest in the breeding </v>

978
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:05.131
<v Speaker 3>family is the core of lineage in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>society and we need to care both about </v>

979
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.350
<v Speaker 3>gays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about um,</v>

980
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:13.120
<v Speaker 3>people have uncertain gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>non binary people,</v>

981
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:15.130
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we can't lose sight of the fact that</v>

982
00:50:15.131 --> 00:50:18.670
<v Speaker 3>we also have to care about the family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the breeding family in distress,</v>

983
00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:24.020
<v Speaker 3>but also have to provide people with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>easy pathway to a reasonably stable </v>

984
00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:24.020
<v Speaker 3>identity.</v>

985
00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't confuse them too.</v>

986
00:50:24.611 --> 00:50:29.611
<v Speaker 3>This is the point is that they have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument that I think we are learning </v>

987
00:50:29.611 --> 00:50:34.030
<v Speaker 3>that gender and discomfort is far more </v>
<v Speaker 3>common than we ever thought,</v>

988
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:39.250
<v Speaker 3>although far less prevalent than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion seems to suggest you do have </v>

989
00:50:40.551 --> 00:50:45.551
<v Speaker 3>a societal interest in steering people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to roles if it's possiBle,</v>

990
00:50:45.651 --> 00:50:50.651
<v Speaker 3>but once somebody is like committedly </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonbinary switch has to flip on us and </v>

991
00:50:50.841 --> 00:50:55.841
<v Speaker 3>we have to become compassionate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize that we have a soul that we </v>

992
00:50:55.841 --> 00:50:57.770
<v Speaker 3>have to take care of and we do have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make some allowances.</v>

993
00:50:57.771 --> 00:51:02.771
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know anybody who's intersex for </v>

994
00:51:02.771 --> 00:51:02.771
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

995
00:51:02.771 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 3>that it's a terrifying state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they face violence.</v>

996
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:04.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

997
00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:09.610
<v Speaker 3>why don't you see dudes kissing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always claim that it's the implied </v>

998
00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:10.730
<v Speaker 3>threat of violence where if it makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>people uncomfortable,</v>

999
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't see people holding hands quite</v>

1000
00:51:13.521 --> 00:51:18.110
<v Speaker 3>so comfortably and you don't see people </v>
<v Speaker 3>being themselves.</v>

1001
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.940
<v Speaker 3>So if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1002
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:25.390
<v Speaker 3>in the idw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stood up for intersex and say this is </v>

1003
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:29.261
<v Speaker 3>the right way to do what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be an absolute service </v>

1004
00:51:29.261 --> 00:51:29.510
<v Speaker 3>to the world because that's something we</v>
<v Speaker 3>could push through.</v>

1005
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that the key that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative christians in this country </v>

1006
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.340
<v Speaker 3>are going to have a diehard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna feel like,</v>

1007
00:51:37.341 --> 00:51:39.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the lord made people in that way,</v>

1008
00:51:39.621 --> 00:51:42.380
<v Speaker 3>we have to accept all the products of </v>
<v Speaker 3>god's creation.</v>

1009
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Where do you fall on that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because this is where people will say,</v>

1010
00:51:45.861 --> 00:51:46.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1011
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.340
<v Speaker 2>was against trans people and gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all the,</v>

1012
00:51:49.341 --> 00:51:50.660
<v Speaker 2>all the nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:51:50.661 --> 00:51:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Well then I hear about your situation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

1014
00:51:52.701 --> 00:51:57.701
<v Speaker 2>It was quite clear is that the federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>government following the provincial </v>

1015
00:51:57.701 --> 00:52:01.031
<v Speaker 2>governments decided that it was okay to </v>
<v Speaker 2>impose requirements for the regulation </v>

1016
00:52:01.031 --> 00:52:04.961
<v Speaker 2>of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't care what the reason for </v>

1017
00:52:04.961 --> 00:52:07.571
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that it was a terrible </v>

1018
00:52:07.571 --> 00:52:09.320
<v Speaker 2>legislative move and partly not because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't only compelled speech.</v>

1019
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:14.710
<v Speaker 2>I read the policy guidelines that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>the framework within which this bill was</v>

1020
00:52:14.781 --> 00:52:19.781
<v Speaker 2>to be interpreted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's pages and pages of them all on </v>

1021
00:52:19.781 --> 00:52:19.781
<v Speaker 2>the ontario human rights commission </v>
<v Speaker 2>website,</v>

1022
00:52:19.781 --> 00:52:21.520
<v Speaker 2>which was late to the federal website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1023
00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:26.830
<v Speaker 2>where they had announced how this bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be interpreted and it contained </v>

1024
00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:30.341
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the insistence that gender was was </v>

1025
00:52:30.341 --> 00:52:34.391
<v Speaker 2>a social socio cultural construct and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in part a socio cultural construct </v>

1026
00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:39.851
<v Speaker 2>and these things are this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot do that because all of a </v>

1027
00:52:39.851 --> 00:52:44.231
<v Speaker 2>sudden the legislation seemed to imply </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at discussion about the biological </v>

1028
00:52:44.231 --> 00:52:48.521
<v Speaker 2>differences between men and women might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be regarded as hate speech and I also </v>

1029
00:52:48.521 --> 00:52:50.390
<v Speaker 2>think we're a fair ways along that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway in Canada.</v>

1030
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:55.960
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think that my fears about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bill were unwarranted and I think that </v>

1031
00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.131
<v Speaker 2>what happened at wilfrid laurier </v>
<v Speaker 2>university is an absolutely perfect </v>

1032
00:53:00.131 --> 00:53:03.251
<v Speaker 2>example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that my stance on that piece </v>

1033
00:53:03.251 --> 00:53:03.740
<v Speaker 2>of legislation was substantively </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

1034
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem is is that or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the the treachery that was involved </v>

1035
00:53:09.201 --> 00:53:14.201
<v Speaker 2>in the bill because I see the bill as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt by the radical left to gain </v>

1036
00:53:14.201 --> 00:53:17.681
<v Speaker 2>linguistic dominance over increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>linguistic dominance over the </v>

1037
00:53:17.681 --> 00:53:21.341
<v Speaker 2>conversation as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Using trans people as the sacrificial </v>

1038
00:53:21.341 --> 00:53:21.770
<v Speaker 2>victims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1039
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I got no shortage of letters from trans </v>
<v Speaker 2>people saying I not so happy being</v>

1040
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 3>you used as a sacrificial victim for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left to advance its linguistic hegemony.</v>

1041
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot more letters like that from </v>
<v Speaker 3>trans people than I did from trans </v>

1042
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:36.720
<v Speaker 3>people criticizing what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1043
00:53:36.721 --> 00:53:40.410
<v Speaker 3>And I also think that this would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>all died away very rapidly if all it was</v>

1044
00:53:40.411 --> 00:53:44.700
<v Speaker 3>about was one professor's objection to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rights of trans people that had very</v>

1045
00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 3>little to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let's just take this,</v>

1046
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.760
<v Speaker 3>take this bull by the horns right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I correct?</v>

1047
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.620
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I have not discussed this.</v>

1048
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:58.100
<v Speaker 3>That your point would be the law is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong place to do it and the culture </v>

1049
00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.000
<v Speaker 3>would be the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1050
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.610
<v Speaker 3>has to be bottom up like the ms thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1051
00:54:02.611 --> 00:54:07.611
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my point is law is absolutely the </v>

1052
00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:07.611
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not let it come from us.</v>

1053
00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:08.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

1054
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.210
<v Speaker 3>this thing has been so crazily </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpreted by the press.</v>

1055
00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:16.170
<v Speaker 3>This is absolute malpractice as far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned by our journal.</v>

1056
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.630
<v Speaker 3>This journal agentic malpractice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should,</v>

1057
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:25.760
<v Speaker 3>I should speak up for some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists in Canada because the post </v>

1058
00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.990
<v Speaker 3>media group is 200 newspapers came out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and supportive my stance.</v>

1059
00:54:27.991 --> 00:54:30.580
<v Speaker 3>So I appreciate those who aren't doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point is,</v>

1060
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 3>is that the fact that we're still having</v>
<v Speaker 3>to discuss this as a tax on all kinds of</v>

1061
00:54:34.891 --> 00:54:39.891
<v Speaker 3>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the more time I have to spend </v>

1062
00:54:39.891 --> 00:54:39.891
<v Speaker 3>saying I'm not all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1063
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:41.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transphobic,</v>

1064
00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:46.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't want the fact that I'm in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interracial marriage because I oppose </v>

1065
00:54:46.981 --> 00:54:50.910
<v Speaker 3>these equity proposals that are complete</v>
<v Speaker 3>abomination.</v>

1066
00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It remember when you and I were in </v>

1067
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.311
<v Speaker 3>tempe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arizona at the comedy club and I said </v>

1068
00:54:58.311 --> 00:54:58.311
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1069
00:54:58.311 --> 00:55:02.480
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't be celebrating this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in an interracial marriage and </v>

1070
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:02.730
<v Speaker 3>everybody clapping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1071
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.510
<v Speaker 3>stop it.</v>

1072
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Unless a feW of you are admissions </v>
<v Speaker 3>officers to ivy league schools,</v>

1073
00:55:07.021 --> 00:55:10.130
<v Speaker 3>in which case we'll talk to you later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point is a terrible thing.</v>

1074
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Credit for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you happen to fall in love with a </v>

1075
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:17.060
<v Speaker 3>person of color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there's moral victory.</v>

1076
00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a metal you know in your </v>

1077
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:22.380
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want it.</v>

1078
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Now what I'm trying to say something </v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly different,</v>

1079
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:28.190
<v Speaker 3>which is I want in on the positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of the social transformation.</v>

1080
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:34.260
<v Speaker 3>I know that my intersex people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurting and I know that trans people,</v>

1081
00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:39.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are present in every culture without </v>

1082
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.141
<v Speaker 3>this social justice stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we should be spearheading what the </v>

1083
00:55:42.141 --> 00:55:43.920
<v Speaker 3>incompetent progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left can't get done.</v>

1084
00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:46.440
<v Speaker 3>WhaT is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what we're doing?</v>

1085
00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:48.120
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

1086
00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:53.070
<v Speaker 3>like gay marriage turned on a dime over </v>
<v Speaker 3>a very short period of time,</v>

1087
00:55:53.071 --> 00:55:54.330
<v Speaker 3>like smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1088
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Somehow that there's no smoking in bars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost incredible.</v>

1089
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're old enough to think about that</v>

1090
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:04.580
<v Speaker 3>we should be spearheading this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they can't get the job done and </v>

1091
00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:05.760
<v Speaker 3>what is our point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not in law yet,</v>

1092
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.070
<v Speaker 3>not in law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do it in culture.</v>

1093
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:12.060
<v Speaker 3>You can't have everybody do his or her </v>
<v Speaker 3>own pronouns,</v>

1094
00:56:12.061 --> 00:56:15.540
<v Speaker 3>which is an absolute disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we could settle on,</v>

1095
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:16.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could do,</v>

1096
00:56:16.621 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1097
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:18.900
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1098
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Speaker 3>pronouns or something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the right thing.</v>

1099
00:56:21.121 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Get a linguist and a to figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimally intrusive</v>

1100
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.450
<v Speaker 2>one time backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incompatible change to the language Is,</v>

1101
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:29.310
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1102
00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not looking forward to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we could get it done.</v>

1103
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:37.610
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing in my public lectures is talking </v>

1104
00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:40.150
<v Speaker 2>about the appropriate and responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>position of the left.</v>

1105
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:45.930
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that if you're pursuing </v>

1106
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.950
<v Speaker 2>goals that have value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you have to do because you have to</v>

1107
00:56:50.951 --> 00:56:53.920
<v Speaker 2>do things in order to stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to pursue goals of value.</v>

1108
00:56:53.921 --> 00:56:56.980
<v Speaker 2>If you do that in a social social space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you're compelled to do,</v>

1109
00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:59.140
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to produce hierarchies</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people,</v>

1110
00:56:59.141 --> 00:57:04.141
<v Speaker 2>different incompetence and you actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to produce hierarchies that are </v>

1111
00:57:04.141 --> 00:57:07.201
<v Speaker 2>based on competence because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient tools for getting that </v>

1112
00:57:07.201 --> 00:57:10.801
<v Speaker 2>particular job done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a reasonable position for </v>

1113
00:57:10.801 --> 00:57:14.611
<v Speaker 2>people on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the center and on the right to say </v>

1114
00:57:14.611 --> 00:57:14.611
<v Speaker 2>stand behind the hierarchies.</v>

1115
00:57:14.611 --> 00:57:19.140
<v Speaker 2>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies can tilt towards a </v>

1116
00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:23.401
<v Speaker 2>corruption and tyranny and they tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispossess people because talents are </v>

1117
00:57:23.401 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 2>distributed on equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the left,</v>

1118
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:27.430
<v Speaker 2>the position of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the appropriate position,</v>

1119
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.340
<v Speaker 2>is to speak up for the dispossessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep the,</v>

1120
00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:34.150
<v Speaker 2>is flexible enough so that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn into tyranny and so then you have a</v>

1121
00:57:34.151 --> 00:57:39.151
<v Speaker 2>dialogue between the right and the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's necessary to maintain the </v>

1122
00:57:39.151 --> 00:57:42.481
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to prune it and keep it </v>

1123
00:57:42.481 --> 00:57:44.671
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that we could </v>

1124
00:57:44.671 --> 00:57:47.881
<v Speaker 2>conceivably contribute to is to improve </v>
<v Speaker 2>the health as you're pointing out </v>

1125
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:50.470
<v Speaker 2>conceptually and otherwise of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue on the left,</v>

1126
00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:52.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like to give the devil his due,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

1127
00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.560
<v Speaker 2>And to say that of course there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place for the left.</v>

1128
00:57:56.830 --> 00:58:01.830
<v Speaker 2>The question is when do they go too far?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is what I've been trying to push </v>

1129
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:01.830
<v Speaker 2>to be a moderate.</v>

1130
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:03.790
<v Speaker 2>So think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is beyond communism.</v>

1131
00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:07.870
<v Speaker 2>If you think about one phrase that sums </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the theory of communism,</v>

1132
00:58:07.871 --> 00:58:12.871
<v Speaker 2>what would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say with the most famous </v>

1133
00:58:12.871 --> 00:58:12.871
<v Speaker 2>for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1134
00:58:12.871 --> 00:58:14.080
<v Speaker 2>probably from each according to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to each according to their need.</v>

1135
00:58:14.081 --> 00:58:19.081
<v Speaker 2>And I'll look at the first part of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>phrase from each according to their </v>

1136
00:58:19.081 --> 00:58:19.081
<v Speaker 2>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1137
00:58:19.081 --> 00:58:22.920
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that there are different </v>
<v Speaker 2>abilities acknowledged in the very core </v>

1138
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.060
<v Speaker 2>of communism beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1139
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

1140
00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1141
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I think the most pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deepest unidimensional pathology </v>

1142
00:58:32.921 --> 00:58:37.900
<v Speaker 2>that characterizes the radical left is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually an attack on competence itself.</v>

1143
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:41.890
<v Speaker 2>And so when I was at the aspen ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>festival a couple of days ago,</v>

1144
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:44.350
<v Speaker 2>I made the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1145
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.730
<v Speaker 2>our hierarchies in the west are </v>
<v Speaker 2>determined to,</v>

1146
00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 2>at least in part by competence right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1147
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.930
<v Speaker 2>the degree to which it's pure competence</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be disputed,</v>

1148
00:58:52.931 --> 00:58:56.830
<v Speaker 2>but intelligence and conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the best predictors of longterm life</v>

1149
00:58:56.831 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 2>success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they don't predict more than</v>

1150
00:58:58.991 --> 00:59:03.991
<v Speaker 2>about 25 percent of the variance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the buzz surrounding what I said was</v>

1151
00:59:04.181 --> 00:59:09.181
<v Speaker 2>that Jordan Peterson is validating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>current patriarchy by making the radical</v>

1152
00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:11.800
<v Speaker 2>claim that it's predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>competence.</v>

1153
00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:12.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1154
00:59:12.881 --> 00:59:14.770
<v Speaker 2>why would they twist that argument?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they didn't want.</v>

1155
00:59:14.771 --> 00:59:19.771
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said that their competence is a </v>

1156
00:59:19.771 --> 00:59:20.530
<v Speaker 2>partial contributor to our successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>

1157
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

1158
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:27.010
<v Speaker 3>that the very idea of differential </v>
<v Speaker 3>competence is unacceptable to the most </v>

1159
00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:31.661
<v Speaker 3>radical will hang on for his left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's look at two separate systems </v>

1160
00:59:31.661 --> 00:59:33.320
<v Speaker 3>because I think that what people do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they focus on one rather than the other,</v>

1161
00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:36.530
<v Speaker 3>and I've had to learn how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we look at chess,</v>

1162
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:41.531
<v Speaker 3>which can be made blind where you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know who you're playing across the </v>

1163
00:59:41.531 --> 00:59:45.521
<v Speaker 3>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we look at musical additions for </v>

1164
00:59:45.521 --> 00:59:45.830
<v Speaker 3>classical orchestras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1165
00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:50.860
<v Speaker 3>where you can put people behind a screen</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this became popular in the </v>

1166
00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>

1167
00:59:50.991 --> 00:59:55.991
<v Speaker 3>a particular basis who is also a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologist may have been instrumental </v>

1168
00:59:55.991 --> 00:59:57.890
<v Speaker 3>in getting this change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you introduced the screen,</v>

1169
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 3>women's participation in orchestras went</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1170
01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:06.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a very positive social program</v>

1171
01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:11.201
<v Speaker 3>because competency was apparently being </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppressed by people's perception,</v>

1172
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.330
<v Speaker 3>by prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a structural problem.</v>

1173
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Now maybe it didn't go as far as people </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't want it,</v>

1174
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:18.320
<v Speaker 3>maybe didn't get to 50 slash 50.</v>

1175
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the stats are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can look in on that.</v>

1176
01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:25.780
<v Speaker 3>When you do it in chess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it has a positive </v>

1177
01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:25.940
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they did it in the australian civil</v>

1178
01:00:25.941 --> 01:00:28.790
<v Speaker 3>service for blind cvs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had the opposite effect.</v>

1179
01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Women got under selected right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1180
01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:36.061
<v Speaker 3>so you're saying even though you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying is that this is situationally </v>

1181
01:00:36.061 --> 01:00:36.390
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is,</v>

1182
01:00:36.391 --> 01:00:38.570
<v Speaker 3>is that the people who want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about chess,</v>

1183
01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:43.580
<v Speaker 3>where the top hundred players last I </v>
<v Speaker 3>checked it was 99 to one male to female,</v>

1184
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 3>which is so like even with structural </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigotry,</v>

1185
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:50.600
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hard to explain.</v>

1186
01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.250
<v Speaker 3>In the other case of the classical </v>
<v Speaker 3>orchestras at what was it?</v>

1187
01:00:57.251 --> 01:00:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Twenty percent increased participation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of females.</v>

1188
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.270
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant amount and they're both </v>
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

1189
01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:07.070
<v Speaker 3>And so the problem is when you push </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and you shove it into the low</v>

1190
01:01:07.071 --> 01:01:12.071
<v Speaker 3>dimensional space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have this idea of is this structural</v>

1191
01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:16.580
<v Speaker 3>a misrepresentation or is it something </v>
<v Speaker 3>else?</v>

1192
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:21.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's both and it's situationally </v>

1193
01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:21.730
<v Speaker 3>dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife had to make a point to me,</v>

1194
01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:26.711
<v Speaker 3>which I was blind to because in physics </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost nothing matters other than like </v>

1195
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:30.470
<v Speaker 3>horsepower and creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't care whether somebody red,</v>

1196
01:01:30.471 --> 01:01:31.040
<v Speaker 3>green,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue,</v>

1197
01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:31.850
<v Speaker 3>male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>female.</v>

1198
01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.880
<v Speaker 3>it's just like almost nobody's got </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting ideas.</v>

1199
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:37.700
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to make any progress </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>

1200
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:43.450
<v Speaker 3>You just want to take the far right tail</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the distribution and you don't want </v>

1201
01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.090
<v Speaker 3>to be harassed about anything other than</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1202
01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Math,</v>
<v Speaker 3>math,</v>

1203
01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:48.820
<v Speaker 3>math,</v>
<v Speaker 3>math is potentially even more.</v>

1204
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:52.610
<v Speaker 3>My wife had to say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1205
01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 3>eric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not everything looks like theoretical </v>

1206
01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 3>physics or differential geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1207
01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:01.811
<v Speaker 3>if you think about community policing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be extremely important to have </v>

1208
01:02:01.811 --> 01:02:06.161
<v Speaker 3>diversity a because why do you want one </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethnic group policing another ethnic </v>

1209
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:12.701
<v Speaker 3>group or all cops being male?</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want diversity in order to have good</v>

1210
01:02:12.711 --> 01:02:17.711
<v Speaker 3>relations so that people see themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflected on the force and if there is </v>

1211
01:02:17.711 --> 01:02:19.410
<v Speaker 3>bigotry and prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it manifests itself.</v>

1212
01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's harder to manifest if people are in</v>

1213
01:02:22.621 --> 01:02:24.750
<v Speaker 3>fact diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was a bit of a wake up call.</v>

1214
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:29.751
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that came from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>harvard math department where it for a </v>

1215
01:02:29.751 --> 01:02:33.141
<v Speaker 3>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it appeared that they would let in one </v>

1216
01:02:33.141 --> 01:02:34.941
<v Speaker 3>woman a year into the phd program and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then she would have a terrible year and </v>

1217
01:02:34.941 --> 01:02:39.501
<v Speaker 3>she dropped out and then one year a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman deferred her admission and so they</v>

1218
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:45.500
<v Speaker 3>added another woman and then she had two</v>
<v Speaker 3>women in the first year and the two of </v>

1219
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.160
<v Speaker 3>them reinforced each other's reality.</v>

1220
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:47.600
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1221
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:52.630
<v Speaker 3>I think I just said something and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody ignored it or I made a point </v>

1222
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:55.971
<v Speaker 3>and then somebody else went to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chalkboard and wrote it down as if it </v>

1223
01:02:55.971 --> 01:02:58.641
<v Speaker 3>was his idea and this group of two women</v>
<v Speaker 3>stayed in the program and that meant the</v>

1224
01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.110
<v Speaker 3>next year that there was one woman lead </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1225
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:02.670
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now there's a group of three,</v>

1226
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:08.060
<v Speaker 3>and that was a situation in which there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was an organic change in the apparent </v>

1227
01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:12.801
<v Speaker 3>ability of women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we need to be differentiating.</v>

1228
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.720
<v Speaker 3>we can't keep reacting to the madness of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the analysis.</v>

1229
01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1230
01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 3>We can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to be the ones who are saying,</v>

1231
01:03:22.021 --> 01:03:22.230
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1232
01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:24.950
<v Speaker 3>let me steal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1233
01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:27.080
<v Speaker 3>Your point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're making a terrible version of this</v>

1234
01:03:27.081 --> 01:03:28.850
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I can even do better.</v>

1235
01:03:28.851 --> 01:03:30.810
<v Speaker 3>And you're welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1236
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:34.850
<v Speaker 3>Because the other thing it's doing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's deranging our conversation.</v>

1237
01:03:34.851 --> 01:03:39.851
<v Speaker 3>This is why I had you talked to ben.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ask him point blank about whether he </v>

1238
01:03:39.851 --> 01:03:41.570
<v Speaker 3>would use the pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his point was,</v>

1239
01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:47.220
<v Speaker 3>I will in general be happy to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody preferred program except if </v>

1240
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.801
<v Speaker 3>we're discussing a trans issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in which case it is to see the </v>

1241
01:03:50.801 --> 01:03:55.511
<v Speaker 3>argument that he doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly see the argument for privately </v>

1242
01:03:56.270 --> 01:04:01.270
<v Speaker 3>mystic grounds open about it and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we have to stop reacting to the </v>

1243
01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:03.380
<v Speaker 3>mat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1244
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:08.410
<v Speaker 3>to the crazy making substrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically you think that for the </v>

1245
01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:12.071
<v Speaker 3>people that are keeping their foot on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pedal at the highest possible level,</v>

1246
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:14.360
<v Speaker 3>we sort of just have to let that go.</v>

1247
01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:17.620
<v Speaker 3>But do you think it would be enough?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if let's say tomorrow you started,</v>

1248
01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:19.550
<v Speaker 3>we finished the show today and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1249
01:04:19.551 --> 01:04:21.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start being the champion </v>
<v Speaker 3>for all the.</v>

1250
01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:26.850
<v Speaker 3>The compassion that trans people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know you're compassionate to </v>

1251
01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:29.591
<v Speaker 3>all people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to be publicly more </v>

1252
01:04:29.591 --> 01:04:32.351
<v Speaker 3>compassionate to trans people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>intersex people and all of and address </v>

1253
01:04:32.351 --> 01:04:32.351
<v Speaker 3>all of the issues that you just brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1254
01:04:32.351 --> 01:04:35.030
<v Speaker 3>If there's another set of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are never gonna,</v>

1255
01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.360
<v Speaker 3>throw you a bone on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are never going to give you a </v>

1256
01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.931
<v Speaker 3>little outreach on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it actually do anything or you </v>

1257
01:04:43.931 --> 01:04:46.871
<v Speaker 3>think it just allows us to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>refugees that will kind of wake up </v>

1258
01:04:46.871 --> 01:04:50.380
<v Speaker 3>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that we're being drained of </v>

1259
01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:50.380
<v Speaker 3>our empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1260
01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.260
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me say I am being drained of my </v>

1261
01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:53.260
<v Speaker 3>empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1262
01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:53.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

1263
01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:58.300
<v Speaker 3>there was a tweet that Kentucky planned </v>
<v Speaker 3>parenthood put out where it was one of </v>

1264
01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.450
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember it was,</v>

1265
01:04:59.451 --> 01:05:00.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1266
01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:05.700
<v Speaker 3>some men have have a uterus and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeated it like 11 times.</v>

1267
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big thing.</v>

1268
01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:07.200
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1269
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:13.930
<v Speaker 3>if they've written,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some trans men have a uterus or if </v>

1270
01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:17.771
<v Speaker 3>they'd written something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have to be compassionate to </v>

1271
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:18.880
<v Speaker 3>people who as what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1272
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.950
<v Speaker 3>I would be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea of some men have you.</v>

1273
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's actually something called </v>

1274
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.660
<v Speaker 3>persistent mullerian duct syndrome where</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who were phenotypically male at </v>

1275
01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:31.510
<v Speaker 3>birth appear to have a uterus because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mysteries of development.</v>

1276
01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.520
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that males and females are one </v>

1277
01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.911
<v Speaker 3>protein away from each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>treating each other like we're separate </v>

1278
01:05:38.911 --> 01:05:40.300
<v Speaker 3>tribes as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1279
01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:45.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fisher like compliments is absolutely </v>

1280
01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:47.890
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I find myself making fun of these</v>

1281
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:50.170
<v Speaker 3>people and I had some tweet about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1282
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:55.710
<v Speaker 3>either we're talking about persistent </v>
<v Speaker 3>mullerian duct syndrome or you're just </v>

1283
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:56.440
<v Speaker 3>eating crayons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping pooping a rainbow.</v>

1284
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.120
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1285
01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:03.121
<v Speaker 3>I thought about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I'm so unsympathetic with </v>

1286
01:06:03.121 --> 01:06:05.710
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to smuggle ideology into </v>
<v Speaker 3>my world,</v>

1287
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:09.170
<v Speaker 3>into compassion to the laboratory and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1288
01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:14.220
<v Speaker 3>this is reprehensible ideology under the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guise of it just gets back to this issue</v>

1289
01:06:14.411 --> 01:06:18.250
<v Speaker 3>that we have been having this expert </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation in the literature where all</v>

1290
01:06:18.251 --> 01:06:22.750
<v Speaker 3>sorts of things that cause people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>clutch pros and they're feigning couches</v>

1291
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.960
<v Speaker 3>are absolutely parts of the parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>literature and biology and psychology </v>

1292
01:06:28.721 --> 01:06:31.120
<v Speaker 3>and anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these places.</v>

1293
01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:34.690
<v Speaker 3>And now everything is discussed </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

1294
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.720
<v Speaker 3>So when you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that there are group </v>

1295
01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:39.720
<v Speaker 3>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1296
01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:44.730
<v Speaker 3>it's shocking if you haven't been part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the professional civil conversation.</v>

1297
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.620
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's a big problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1298
01:06:47.621 --> 01:06:51.040
<v Speaker 3>is that this is this esoteric versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>exoteric speak,</v>

1299
01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:56.041
<v Speaker 3>which is the sort of intellectual elite </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the universities have this private </v>

1300
01:06:57.821 --> 01:07:02.821
<v Speaker 3>way of talking amongst themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 3>journals and in this public way of </v>

1301
01:07:02.821 --> 01:07:05.290
<v Speaker 3>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is absolutely essential in some</v>

1302
01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:06.820
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's being abused and others.</v>

1303
01:07:06.821 --> 01:07:07.690
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1304
01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.900
<v Speaker 3>the trade theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1305
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:12.170
<v Speaker 3>know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they talk about,</v>

1306
01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:15.490
<v Speaker 3>that the importance of free trade based </v>
<v Speaker 3>on ricardian equivalence and comparative</v>

1307
01:07:15.491 --> 01:07:18.930
<v Speaker 3>advantage is a bullshit argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1308
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.930
<v Speaker 3>it's a very crude thing that's very hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>to argue with mathematically,</v>

1309
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.960
<v Speaker 3>but it's behind the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're having a completely different </v>

1310
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.750
<v Speaker 3>conversation and they have the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're entitled to do this.</v>

1311
01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:33.780
<v Speaker 3>And the answer from my perspective is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just replaced one concept which was </v>

1312
01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:36.250
<v Speaker 3>a caldor hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1313
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.050
<v Speaker 3>improvement with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1314
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:43.110
<v Speaker 3>with paredo improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pereno improvement makes everybody </v>

1315
01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:45.961
<v Speaker 3>better off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyler hicks leave some people worse off </v>

1316
01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:48.701
<v Speaker 3>than some people better off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'd have to tax the better off to </v>

1317
01:07:48.701 --> 01:07:48.701
<v Speaker 3>compensate for the worst at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1318
01:07:48.701 --> 01:07:52.680
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're having a countrywide freakout </v>

1319
01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.760
<v Speaker 3>because the economists have developed </v>
<v Speaker 3>two separate conversations,</v>

1320
01:07:54.761 --> 01:07:58.540
<v Speaker 3>one for the public where they push out </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are not necessarily good for</v>

1321
01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:03.541
<v Speaker 3>the median individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very bad for particular communities and </v>

1322
01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:08.460
<v Speaker 3>a separate conversation that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>having amongst themselves and they are </v>

1323
01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.640
<v Speaker 3>serving these interests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we have to do,</v>

1324
01:08:09.641 --> 01:08:11.800
<v Speaker 3>something about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can no longer.</v>

1325
01:08:11.801 --> 01:08:14.560
<v Speaker 3>This goes back to your gutenberg point </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the technology issue.</v>

1326
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:19.930
<v Speaker 3>We cannot have this level of division </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the private and the public </v>

1327
01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:24.251
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know more about what's wrong with the </v>

1328
01:08:24.251 --> 01:08:24.251
<v Speaker 3>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1329
01:08:24.251 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 3>in the high tech sector than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>national academy feels.</v>

1330
01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:28.970
<v Speaker 3>A national academy of sciences wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss.</v>

1331
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:33.971
<v Speaker 3>They are at the center effectively of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy in the 19 eighties and early </v>

1332
01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:39.341
<v Speaker 3>nineties to change the laws of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States in order to make it </v>

1333
01:08:39.341 --> 01:08:43.961
<v Speaker 3>impossible for young scientists to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bargain with phds in hand with their </v>

1334
01:08:43.961 --> 01:08:46.850
<v Speaker 3>employers to get the six figure salaries</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the market was going to give.</v>

1335
01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:52.420
<v Speaker 3>Now we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can play a game where the national is</v>

1336
01:08:52.881 --> 01:08:57.881
<v Speaker 3>having a private conversation with me </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they've had me four or five times </v>

1337
01:08:57.881 --> 01:09:00.710
<v Speaker 3>over there and they're not going to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>any reflection of this in the public,</v>

1338
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:06.010
<v Speaker 3>but I now have 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter followers and I know why people </v>

1339
01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:08.270
<v Speaker 3>are angry about immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has nothing to do with immigrants.</v>

1340
01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:13.420
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with the fact that our </v>

1341
01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:17.141
<v Speaker 3>ruling classes had been figuring out how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to transfer money from one group of </v>

1342
01:09:17.141 --> 01:09:18.860
<v Speaker 3>americans to another group of americans </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if they could use puppies,</v>

1343
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.040
<v Speaker 3>they use puppies because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>object puppies.</v>

1344
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the problem is is that you now have</v>

1345
01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:28.310
<v Speaker 3>a group of people who are able to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these conversations to say,</v>

1346
01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:33.311
<v Speaker 3>let me show you the playbook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me show you what's really going on </v>

1347
01:09:33.311 --> 01:09:34.530
<v Speaker 3>on in these technical discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>

1348
01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.040
<v Speaker 3>there are differences between groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are measurable.</v>

1349
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w,</v>

1350
01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't think any of us really want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be talking about race and iq </v>

1351
01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:46.601
<v Speaker 3>particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you try to say there is </v>

1352
01:09:46.601 --> 01:09:49.100
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no evidence to show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's not going to be true and the</v>

1353
01:09:49.101 --> 01:09:51.050
<v Speaker 3>scientists are going to have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1354
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:53.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't right.</v>

1355
01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I report on what the literature says.</v>

1356
01:09:56.271 --> 01:09:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you what the literature </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1357
01:09:57.921 --> 01:10:00.410
<v Speaker 3>and the literature says some things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want it to say,</v>

1358
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.650
<v Speaker 3>but that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing new about that.</v>

1359
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Lots of science is very upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Evolutionary theory is upsetting.</v>

1360
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Psychology is upsetting and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>upsetting literature.</v>

1361
01:10:11.931 --> 01:10:15.950
<v Speaker 3>We haven't figured out what we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do culturally as it becomes available</v>

1362
01:10:15.951 --> 01:10:20.951
<v Speaker 3>to everybody and we have people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of gleefully talking about things </v>

1363
01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:22.560
<v Speaker 3>like race and iq and I want to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1364
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.480
<v Speaker 3>cut it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

1365
01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:28.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know everything but </v>

1366
01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:28.790
<v Speaker 3>we're getting more and more knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm worried about where it can go.</v>

1367
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.250
<v Speaker 3>And we have other groups of people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1368
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's absolutely nothing to this race </v>

1369
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Speaker 3>and iq thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking,</v>

1370
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:37.260
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like as best as you're,</v>

1371
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:42.270
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're now making an attempt to stir up </v>

1372
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:45.041
<v Speaker 3>the asbestos to try to get rid of it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to loosen all these fibers </v>

1373
01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:47.150
<v Speaker 3>rather than doing this professionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>and scientifically the right way,</v>

1374
01:10:47.151 --> 01:10:49.280
<v Speaker 3>so I do think that there's an issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the esoteric,</v>

1375
01:10:49.281 --> 01:10:54.281
<v Speaker 3>the exoteric and what it is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do as experts to handle the </v>

1376
01:10:54.281 --> 01:10:58.841
<v Speaker 3>knowledge that we've been sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>exposed to and that the public hasn't </v>

1377
01:10:59.061 --> 01:11:04.061
<v Speaker 3>and it's coming out in the worst ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is part of what's fueling the </v>

1378
01:11:04.061 --> 01:11:04.061
<v Speaker 3>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make America great again.</v>

1379
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:09.110
<v Speaker 3>Situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the public knows something is </v>

1380
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:11.831
<v Speaker 3>off with their expert communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The expert communities are not being </v>

1381
01:11:11.831 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 3>honest about what the literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would say that right</v>

1382
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:19.250
<v Speaker 2>there is the magic of what I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been such a pleasure of being part </v>

1383
01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:24.321
<v Speaker 2>of with you for these last two months or</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you are giving people a little </v>

1384
01:11:24.321 --> 01:11:26.610
<v Speaker 2>bit of all of these people know </v>
<v Speaker 2>something's not right.</v>

1385
01:11:26.611 --> 01:11:28.620
<v Speaker 2>The information we're getting is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1386
01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:30.330
<v Speaker 2>The language we're speaking is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1387
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:32.640
<v Speaker 2>The way we're talking about government </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not right.</v>

1388
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Everything that eric just said right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1389
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:39.440
<v Speaker 2>and you're giving them a little room </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day to figure it out for </v>

1390
01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:39.980
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1391
01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.120
<v Speaker 2>that strikes me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two things that are happening.</v>

1392
01:11:42.121 --> 01:11:47.121
<v Speaker 2>One is because of the long form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually possible to have more in </v>

1393
01:11:47.121 --> 01:11:51.171
<v Speaker 2>depth discussions about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other is that because my </v>

1394
01:11:51.171 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 2>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1395
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:56.070
<v Speaker 2>and the discussions that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>having focus on the development of ideas</v>

1396
01:11:56.071 --> 01:11:59.820
<v Speaker 2>rather than on the ideas themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that gives people a bit of breathing</v>

1397
01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:00.330
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

1398
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the questions that I'm really </v>

1399
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:05.900
<v Speaker 2>curious about is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1400
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.440
<v Speaker 2>and I'd like to know what you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

1401
01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:12.860
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it is that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally driving the radical </v>

1402
01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:14.250
<v Speaker 2>newness of the left?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>

1403
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does seem so counterproductive.</v>

1404
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Even two to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on stated positions,</v>

1405
01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:22.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when I was an aspen for example,</v>

1406
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I talked about the literature on </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological differences between men and </v>

1407
01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:28.670
<v Speaker 2>women in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in psychology,</v>

1408
01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:33.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like mostly men and the women are </v>

1409
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:34.680
<v Speaker 2>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in the dimensions where they differ</v>

1410
01:12:34.681 --> 01:12:39.681
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's way more overlap than there is </v>

1411
01:12:39.681 --> 01:12:39.681
<v Speaker 2>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1412
01:12:39.681 --> 01:12:43.041
<v Speaker 2>So aggression is a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you take a random man and a random</v>

1413
01:12:43.891 --> 01:12:47.220
<v Speaker 2>woman out of the population and you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bet on who was the more aggressive,</v>

1414
01:12:47.221 --> 01:12:50.040
<v Speaker 2>if you bet on the man you'd be right 60 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the time,</v>

1415
01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:51.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's not that much.</v>

1416
01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.210
<v Speaker 2>But then all the actions at the tails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1417
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.200
<v Speaker 2>So you don't care about how aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>the average person is.</v>

1418
01:12:58.201 --> 01:13:03.201
<v Speaker 2>You care about how aggressive the really</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive people are and they're all </v>

1419
01:13:03.201 --> 01:13:07.461
<v Speaker 2>male and so you end up putting them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison which accounts for the massive </v>

1420
01:13:07.461 --> 01:13:10.971
<v Speaker 2>differential between men and women in </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison rates and so you can have small </v>

1421
01:13:10.971 --> 01:13:12.690
<v Speaker 2>differences at the meeting and radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences at the extremes.</v>

1422
01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:18.230
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the fact that people don't </v>

1423
01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.121
<v Speaker 2>understand that is he is partly willful </v>
<v Speaker 2>blindness on the part of the </v>

1424
01:13:20.121 --> 01:13:23.691
<v Speaker 2>ideologically committed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also partly because it's somewhat </v>

1425
01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:26.600
<v Speaker 2>complex statistically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I think about the like the </v>

1426
01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.751
<v Speaker 2>audience that I was addressing it aspen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't happy about me talking </v>

1427
01:13:29.751 --> 01:13:33.261
<v Speaker 2>about biological differences in </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality between men and women and I </v>

1428
01:13:33.261 --> 01:13:33.261
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1429
01:13:33.261 --> 01:13:36.840
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly from your leftist perspective is</v>

1430
01:13:36.841 --> 01:13:41.841
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it so necessary for you to make </v>

1431
01:13:41.841 --> 01:13:44.511
<v Speaker 2>the presumption that there cannot be any</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences whatsoever between men and </v>

1432
01:13:44.511 --> 01:13:44.511
<v Speaker 2>women?</v>

1433
01:13:44.511 --> 01:13:49.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well first of all there are so that's a </v>

1434
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:51.021
<v Speaker 2>big problem for your theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why all of a sudden has this become </v>

1435
01:13:51.021 --> 01:13:54.231
<v Speaker 2>an axiomatic position of the left that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these differences can exist when what </v>

1436
01:13:54.231 --> 01:13:56.580
<v Speaker 2>you want to do in principle is free up </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to make choices.</v>

1437
01:13:56.790 --> 01:14:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that or to make choices in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>market that would allow for those </v>

1438
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:03.480
<v Speaker 2>choices in keeping with their intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

1439
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Like why did that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why that shifted.</v>

1440
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:09.570
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting is you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the intellectual liberal elite.</v>

1441
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.660
<v Speaker 2>That's the type of people you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking in front of,</v>

1442
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:11.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If</v>

1443
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:17.550
<v Speaker 3>you were just talking in front of just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>group of lefties or a group of writers </v>

1444
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:20.570
<v Speaker 3>are saying about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the commentariat yeah,</v>

1445
01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.370
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1446
01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1447
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:23.950
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do with that?</v>

1448
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:25.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me come straight at it.</v>

1449
01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:33.360
<v Speaker 3>We on the left had an idea that if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could get rid of cultural bias in iq </v>

1450
01:14:35.141 --> 01:14:39.460
<v Speaker 3>testing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we could get rid of misogyny that was</v>

1451
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.520
<v Speaker 3>structural in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we would get a particular kind of </v>

1452
01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:49.021
<v Speaker 3>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we did make things better in many </v>

1453
01:14:49.021 --> 01:14:52.261
<v Speaker 3>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't go as far as we were </v>

1454
01:14:52.261 --> 01:14:53.260
<v Speaker 3>expecting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is what people are wrestling</v>

1455
01:14:53.261 --> 01:14:55.450
<v Speaker 3>with and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hesitate to call it this,</v>

1456
01:14:55.451 --> 01:14:57.370
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's the most powerful way </v>
<v Speaker 3>of saying it.</v>

1457
01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:00.070
<v Speaker 3>It's the great depression shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>2018.</v>

1458
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:05.790
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there still is structural </v>

1459
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:05.790
<v Speaker 3>oppression.</v>

1460
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:08.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Robert Moses is design a of New </v>

1461
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:10.360
<v Speaker 3>York city's a highways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bridges and byways,</v>

1462
01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:14.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>famously trying to keep buses from going</v>

1463
01:15:14.231 --> 01:15:17.560
<v Speaker 3>to jones beach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess as it jumped to jones beach.</v>

1464
01:15:17.561 --> 01:15:19.150
<v Speaker 3>He literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I grew up on long island,</v>

1465
01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:24.151
<v Speaker 3>the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bridges going over the la at that </v>

1466
01:15:24.151 --> 01:15:27.060
<v Speaker 3>area are lower because they didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>us to bring the people from meals out </v>

1467
01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 3>into harlem so that it doesn't affect </v>
<v Speaker 3>real estate prices somewhere else on the</v>

1468
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:31.430
<v Speaker 3>east side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1469
01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:36.690
<v Speaker 3>there really is structural oppression </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way there was when there were </v>

1470
01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:40.770
<v Speaker 3>literacy tests for voting which were </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructed so that no black person </v>

1471
01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:42.520
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could pass because it was impossible.</v>

1472
01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's less of it now and there's </v>

1473
01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:48.130
<v Speaker 3>not enough of it to explain some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>

1474
01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:53.700
<v Speaker 3>And the great fear is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the left program to try to </v>

1475
01:15:54.491 --> 01:15:58.750
<v Speaker 3>produce better representation and better</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities for women,</v>

1476
01:15:58.751 --> 01:16:03.751
<v Speaker 3>for minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever is going to stall out if we </v>

1477
01:16:03.751 --> 01:16:04.450
<v Speaker 3>start to think of these things as </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>

1478
01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:06.150
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why is it a problem that.</v>

1479
01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

1480
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Why is it a problem if it stalls out </v>
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>

1481
01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:14.191
<v Speaker 3>Is it because there's all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>radical activists who then don't have </v>

1482
01:16:14.191 --> 01:16:14.600
<v Speaker 3>anything to do or is there that's part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of him that.</v>

1483
01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:16.840
<v Speaker 3>So what you've seen with the southern </v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty law center,</v>

1484
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:22.500
<v Speaker 3>which is that you have an institution </v>
<v Speaker 3>that fundamentally a accomplished much </v>

1485
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:26.311
<v Speaker 3>of its mission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it still had a large kitty and </v>

1486
01:16:26.311 --> 01:16:27.730
<v Speaker 3>idle idle hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like humanities departments to</v>

1487
01:16:27.731 --> 01:16:28.650
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1488
01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we can get to that.</v>

1489
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.640
<v Speaker 3>But I also want to steal man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other position so that you have </v>

1490
01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.760
<v Speaker 3>something to fight against or directed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestle with.</v>

1491
01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:43.020
<v Speaker 3>If I think about I do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>different with women in the workplace </v>

1492
01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.870
<v Speaker 3>with respect to trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>what is unfair to them because there are</v>

1493
01:16:46.871 --> 01:16:49.990
<v Speaker 3>things that are very unfair to them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I do is to say,</v>

1494
01:16:49.991 --> 01:16:54.991
<v Speaker 3>tell me about the great ideas of females</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the great contributions that are </v>

1495
01:16:54.991 --> 01:16:59.290
<v Speaker 3>sitting there on the table in part </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they had a female discover,</v>

1496
01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:00.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1497
01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:01.170
<v Speaker 3>So you could look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1498
01:17:01.171 --> 01:17:04.950
<v Speaker 3>vira ruben's work in which never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1499
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:07.510
<v Speaker 3>never got a nobel prize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows about it in,</v>

1500
01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:12.520
<v Speaker 3>in astrophysics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I went through one of these things </v>

1501
01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:15.461
<v Speaker 3>with my wife where we did this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with gauge theory in economics in the </v>

1502
01:17:15.461 --> 01:17:19.601
<v Speaker 3>harvard economics department,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it was one of the most </v>

1503
01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:23.741
<v Speaker 3>sensational breakthroughs in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematical and bedrock economic theory</v>

1504
01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:30.170
<v Speaker 3>and the last 25 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll just be very clear every time </v>

1505
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:34.181
<v Speaker 3>people want to figure out how to tax </v>
<v Speaker 3>americans more and cut their benefits </v>

1506
01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:38.210
<v Speaker 3>without paying the price of touching the</v>
<v Speaker 3>so called third rail of politics.</v>

1507
01:17:38.211 --> 01:17:43.211
<v Speaker 3>They realized that the cpi indexes both </v>
<v Speaker 3>tax receipts and entitlements,</v>

1508
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:45.410
<v Speaker 3>so payments like social security and </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicare,</v>

1509
01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:51.280
<v Speaker 3>and if you can show that the cpi is </v>
<v Speaker 3>overstated than the ideas that you get </v>

1510
01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.350
<v Speaker 3>to take in more tax revenue and you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay old people and sick people less.</v>

1511
01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.680
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a very popular game in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington to gerrymander the </v>

1512
01:17:59.680 --> 01:17:59.680
<v Speaker 3>gerrymander,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the measurement.</v>

1513
01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two ways that you do that.</v>

1514
01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:05.540
<v Speaker 3>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you go from a fixed basket where</v>

1515
01:18:05.541 --> 01:18:10.541
<v Speaker 3>you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say basketballs and glasses and </v>

1516
01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:13.631
<v Speaker 3>you figure out what the price of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>basket is over time to something which </v>

1517
01:18:13.631 --> 01:18:17.921
<v Speaker 3>is what is the utility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is maybe I want slightly </v>

1518
01:18:17.921 --> 01:18:18.740
<v Speaker 3>more glasses or basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it with coffee and tea.</v>

1519
01:18:18.741 --> 01:18:23.741
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to trade off some amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee for some amount of tea to get my </v>

1520
01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:26.660
<v Speaker 3>caffeine fix if there's a problem or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bumper crop in Brazil.</v>

1521
01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing you do is that you keep </v>

1522
01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:32.870
<v Speaker 3>updating these baskets and that's called</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaining.</v>

1523
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:38.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do both of those things </v>

1524
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:40.841
<v Speaker 3>together because there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a presumed impossibility results that </v>

1525
01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:45.380
<v Speaker 3>you can't have a true cost of a chain </v>
<v Speaker 3>cost of living index,</v>

1526
01:18:45.381 --> 01:18:50.381
<v Speaker 3>except that my wife and I solved that </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem in the mid 19 nineties at the </v>

1527
01:18:50.381 --> 01:18:53.060
<v Speaker 3>same time that the boskin commission was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to back out a,</v>

1528
01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:58.180
<v Speaker 3>an exact one point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one percent overstatement because that </v>

1529
01:18:58.180 --> 01:18:58.180
<v Speaker 3>would save a trillion dollar.</v>

1530
01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:02.210
<v Speaker 3>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand they weren't </v>

1531
01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:02.210
<v Speaker 3>given the task.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go find a one point,</v>

1532
01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:05.681
<v Speaker 3>one percent overstatement and justify it</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that we can cut benefits and raise </v>

1533
01:19:05.681 --> 01:19:10.581
<v Speaker 3>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my wife got in the middle of that </v>

1534
01:19:10.581 --> 01:19:10.581
<v Speaker 3>bank robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1535
01:19:10.581 --> 01:19:12.320
<v Speaker 3>as it was being attempted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she got whacked.</v>

1536
01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Now I wanted to fight these sons of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitches,</v>

1537
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:21.250
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In particular as a professor named dale </v>

1538
01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:21.950
<v Speaker 3>jorgenson who spearheaded the attempt </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1539
01:19:21.951 --> 01:19:24.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really crushed her and when,</v>

1540
01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:27.620
<v Speaker 3>when she was on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was getting her dissertation.</v>

1541
01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:31.210
<v Speaker 3>This is great work and the cost of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan is,</v>

1542
01:19:31.211 --> 01:19:36.211
<v Speaker 3>is that there's great work done by women</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is sitting there because </v>

1543
01:19:36.211 --> 01:19:40.691
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally the women don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight the way you and I would fight for </v>

1544
01:19:40.691 --> 01:19:41.780
<v Speaker 3>our work because it's not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

1545
01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.180
<v Speaker 3>It's unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1546
01:19:44.181 --> 01:19:49.181
<v Speaker 3>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a very aggressive response to </v>

1547
01:19:49.181 --> 01:19:49.181
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1548
01:19:49.181 --> 01:19:49.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how dare you talk about my work,</v>

1549
01:19:49.431 --> 01:19:50.960
<v Speaker 3>do you know how much better my work is </v>
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>

1550
01:19:50.961 --> 01:19:55.290
<v Speaker 3>your work and let's do this now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got that.</v>

1551
01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.040
<v Speaker 3>That's a complicated thing too because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1552
01:19:58.041 --> 01:20:00.800
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a piece of brilliant work to rise up</v>

1553
01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:03.140
<v Speaker 3>to the point where it's universally </v>
<v Speaker 3>acclaimed,</v>

1554
01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.150
<v Speaker 3>it takes a lot more than merely the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant work that's like.</v>

1555
01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like putting a product out into the</v>

1556
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:14.220
<v Speaker 3>marketplace like a consumer product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might have a brilliant product,</v>

1557
01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:19.520
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that you have a brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 3>product is about five percent of what </v>

1558
01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:23.091
<v Speaker 3>you need to have a successful product </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the rest of it is sales and </v>

1559
01:20:23.091 --> 01:20:26.391
<v Speaker 3>marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then if so you might say there's </v>

1560
01:20:26.391 --> 01:20:29.250
<v Speaker 3>many ideas that we have taken stock of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we should have taken stock of those</v>

1561
01:20:29.251 --> 01:20:33.330
<v Speaker 3>that we have taken stock of over this </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird combination of brilliant idea plus</v>

1562
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.060
<v Speaker 3>brilliant and forceful marketing plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>luck.</v>

1563
01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:36.930
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1564
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.970
<v Speaker 3>so if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1565
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.180
<v Speaker 3>if it's the case for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that because women are less assertive,</v>

1566
01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.210
<v Speaker 3>they're less likely to fight those ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward,</v>

1567
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:48.210
<v Speaker 3>although equally likely to generate as </v>
<v Speaker 3>many brilliant ideas,</v>

1568
01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.730
<v Speaker 3>then that's going to cause a detriment </v>
<v Speaker 3>in their movement forward.</v>

1569
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to contend with,</v>

1570
01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:55.080
<v Speaker 3>well that's what I'm trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that fundamentally the reason I</v>

1571
01:20:55.081 --> 01:20:57.720
<v Speaker 3>asked for don't tell me about the women </v>
<v Speaker 3>being suppressed.</v>

1572
01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:00.630
<v Speaker 3>Tell me about the Ideas of women so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

1573
01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:04.110
<v Speaker 3>I can use my aggressive as long as we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a male dominated system.</v>

1574
01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:07.020
<v Speaker 3>You have men who want to fight for great</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

1575
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.890
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1576
01:21:07.891 --> 01:21:12.891
<v Speaker 3>but then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we have a male dominant system or do </v>

1577
01:21:12.891 --> 01:21:14.280
<v Speaker 3>we have a dominant dominated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>

1578
01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:15.210
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

1579
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:18.300
<v Speaker 3>let me tease this apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have been in I think five,</v>

1580
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.740
<v Speaker 3>almost all male field.</v>

1581
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1582
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've touched mathematics,</v>

1583
01:21:22.681 --> 01:21:25.260
<v Speaker 3>theoretical physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>economics,</v>

1584
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:28.680
<v Speaker 3>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a tech and they're not all male,</v>

1585
01:21:28.681 --> 01:21:33.681
<v Speaker 3>but the male dominated fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those fields I found had a </v>

1586
01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:36.690
<v Speaker 3>cancerous attitude towards women that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just visible.</v>

1587
01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:41.691
<v Speaker 3>So I got a chance to see in finance all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the bad behavior that people talked </v>

1588
01:21:41.851 --> 01:21:43.380
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the objectification,</v>

1589
01:21:43.381 --> 01:21:44.640
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1590
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:46.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>locker room talk,</v>

1591
01:21:46.321 --> 01:21:49.380
<v Speaker 3>which was just absolutely natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not in every context,</v>

1592
01:21:49.381 --> 01:21:54.381
<v Speaker 3>but it was often enough in the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>fields in general.</v>

1593
01:21:54.421 --> 01:21:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Like in math,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I ever heard people making</v>

1594
01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:03.810
<v Speaker 3>nasty comments about women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the same weird way,</v>

1595
01:22:03.811 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 3>it's not like I'm deaf to it because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can hear it.</v>

1596
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:09.720
<v Speaker 3>In one case I didn't hear it very often </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other kids in physics,</v>

1597
01:22:09.721 --> 01:22:11.700
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hear many nasty comments about </v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

1598
01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:15.630
<v Speaker 3>but it was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Particle theory for a period of time was</v>

1599
01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:20.631
<v Speaker 3>incredibly aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like labor economics was super </v>

1600
01:22:20.631 --> 01:22:23.991
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>symplectic geometry inside of math was </v>

1601
01:22:23.991 --> 01:22:23.991
<v Speaker 3>super female friendly.</v>

1602
01:22:23.991 --> 01:22:27.690
<v Speaker 3>So there is definitely this difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>in texture between,</v>

1603
01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:28.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1604
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000
<v Speaker 3>these different places in male dominated</v>
<v Speaker 3>fields and having seen relatively benign</v>

1605
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:38.130
<v Speaker 3>male dominated fields at hyper toxic </v>
<v Speaker 3>male dominated fields.</v>

1606
01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:43.160
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that I don't love going </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a particle theory seminar where </v>

1607
01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.190
<v Speaker 3>everybody's peacocking because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively uninteresting relative to the</v>

1608
01:22:47.191 --> 01:22:50.610
<v Speaker 3>work you would say to some degree that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would indicate that the,</v>

1609
01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:55.670
<v Speaker 3>that the system has become somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt in the ways that systems can be </v>

1610
01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:59.241
<v Speaker 3>corrupt and that what's pushing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward in those fields is less about </v>

1611
01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:02.040
<v Speaker 3>competence and more about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know.</v>

1612
01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know either,</v>

1613
01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:04.800
<v Speaker 3>but you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

1614
01:23:04.890 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could generate</v>

1615
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.160
<v Speaker 2>that as a hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you one of the things our </v>

1616
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.531
<v Speaker 2>psychometric work has revealed this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite interesting is when we've looked </v>

1617
01:23:13.531 --> 01:23:17.371
<v Speaker 2>at differences in men and women with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to outcome and then controlled </v>

1618
01:23:17.371 --> 01:23:21.871
<v Speaker 2>for personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The personality differences almost </v>

1619
01:23:21.871 --> 01:23:21.871
<v Speaker 2>always obliterate the gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences,</v>

1620
01:23:21.871 --> 01:23:23.680
<v Speaker 2>which means it's actually not a gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference,</v>

1621
01:23:23.681 --> 01:23:26.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a personality difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's flip that because this is.</v>

1622
01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.420
<v Speaker 2>It isn't always the general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>

1623
01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.910
<v Speaker 2>so I think that that's very important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you're going to get,</v>

1624
01:23:30.911 --> 01:23:35.911
<v Speaker 2>because I could say then for the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas of agreeable man in these fields </v>

1625
01:23:35.911 --> 01:23:38.890
<v Speaker 2>might be as likely to be totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally agree with you.</v>

1626
01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Now here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the next part of it.</v>

1627
01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Many let's say let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not do it as male,</v>

1628
01:23:44.201 --> 01:23:47.620
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many agreeable people have the idea that</v>

1629
01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:51.900
<v Speaker 2>the problem is is that the fields are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>tilted towards disagree ability.</v>

1630
01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:53.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't happen to believe this,</v>

1631
01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:59.100
<v Speaker 2>that we're losing good ideas because </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeable people can't make progress and</v>

1632
01:24:00.011 --> 01:24:05.011
<v Speaker 2>in those circumstances the claim isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just have an open competition and </v>

1633
01:24:05.011 --> 01:24:09.391
<v Speaker 2>see what rises to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's let's change the structure of </v>

1634
01:24:09.391 --> 01:24:10.450
<v Speaker 2>things now this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1635
01:24:10.451 --> 01:24:12.150
<v Speaker 2>so there's a problem wIth that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let let.</v>

1636
01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Let me find out what metric problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1637
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at what predicts success in </v>

1638
01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:24.590
<v Speaker 2>workplaces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally what predicts his iq and </v>

1639
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:27.841
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness is a very trivial </v>

1640
01:24:27.841 --> 01:24:27.841
<v Speaker 2>predictor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1641
01:24:27.841 --> 01:24:32.431
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you do see is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeable people tend to get paid less </v>

1642
01:24:32.431 --> 01:24:34.210
<v Speaker 2>for the same work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know why that is exactly.</v>

1643
01:24:34.211 --> 01:24:36.340
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if they don't bargain as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1644
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the simplest explanation </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they're there.</v>

1645
01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:42.340
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to take advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeable people.</v>

1646
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:44.200
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeable.</v>

1647
01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:49.200
<v Speaker 2>It's the downside of being agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but agreeableness is not a very good </v>

1648
01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:52.951
<v Speaker 2>predictor of workplace success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a corrupt literature </v>

1649
01:24:52.951 --> 01:24:55.951
<v Speaker 2>that's associated with this because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole literature on emotional </v>

1650
01:24:55.951 --> 01:24:56.380
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emotional intelligence puts you ahead in</v>

1651
01:24:56.381 --> 01:24:57.430
<v Speaker 2>the workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1652
01:24:57.670 --> 01:24:59.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

1653
01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Emotional intelligence is almost in </v>
<v Speaker 2>indiscriminate from trait agreeableness </v>

1654
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:08.670
<v Speaker 2>and trait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agreeableness actually puts you behind </v>

1655
01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:08.670
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the managerial domain.</v>

1656
01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1657
01:25:09.311 --> 01:25:12.670
<v Speaker 2>that means the managerial domain is </v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudiced against agreeable people,</v>

1658
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:17.910
<v Speaker 2>but then there's some evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreeable people make better </v>

1659
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:20.401
<v Speaker 2>managers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that they </v>

1660
01:25:20.401 --> 01:25:20.401
<v Speaker 2>can't be pushed around because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
01:25:20.401 --> 01:25:21.010
<v Speaker 2>if you're a manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

1662
01:25:21.011 --> 01:25:26.011
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you have to do is you have to deal </v>

1663
01:25:26.011 --> 01:25:27.421
<v Speaker 2>with the concerns of your employees and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the agreeable </v>

1664
01:25:27.421 --> 01:25:30.121
<v Speaker 2>interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes if you're a manager you </v>

1665
01:25:30.121 --> 01:25:31.090
<v Speaker 2>have to take the slackers and give them </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>

1666
01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:31.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1667
01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.700
<v Speaker 2>that's somethIng that only a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreeable person can do this.</v>

1668
01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:40.770
<v Speaker 2>But there isn't much evidence on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometric front that agreeableness,</v>

1669
01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1670
01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:49.620
<v Speaker 2>that agreeableness is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a major contributor to workplace </v>

1671
01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:52.711
<v Speaker 2>success in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't obvious to me from the </v>

1672
01:25:52.711 --> 01:25:55.771
<v Speaker 2>psychometric work that the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies in general are contaminated </v>

1673
01:25:56.171 --> 01:25:59.350
<v Speaker 2>by a preference for disagreeable people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any evidence for that.</v>

1674
01:25:59.351 --> 01:26:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1675
01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem with this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion is you have,</v>

1676
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:07.280
<v Speaker 2>there are roles in which agreeability </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

1677
01:26:07.281 --> 01:26:08.930
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have a team where there's,</v>

1678
01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:11.360
<v Speaker 2>you need a certain balance of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1679
01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.220
<v Speaker 2>It's probably works for customer </v>
<v Speaker 2>service,</v>

1680
01:26:13.221 --> 01:26:17.930
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be agreeable or right carrot people.</v>

1681
01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.340
<v Speaker 2>So all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1682
01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.400
<v Speaker 2>the world didn't come up with a big five</v>
<v Speaker 2>traits a and distribute us across them.</v>

1683
01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>

1684
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:32.540
<v Speaker 2>if they don't have advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like are you color blind?</v>

1685
01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:34.610
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>father is and he can,</v>

1686
01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.640
<v Speaker 2>he can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can see animals in the bush as I was </v>

1687
01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:39.640
<v Speaker 2>going to make the point is that from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1688
01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:40.820
<v Speaker 2>your contrast blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1689
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that when I'm talking </v>

1690
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.690
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that strikes color normal people as very</v>

1691
01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:49.520
<v Speaker 2>strange with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a strange way to look at the</v>

1692
01:26:49.521 --> 01:26:51.650
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact is is that these traits are</v>

1693
01:26:51.651 --> 01:26:53.710
<v Speaker 2>retained because they have different </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses stats,</v>

1694
01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:58.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the fact that if you focus on </v>

1695
01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:58.820
<v Speaker 2>the right tail of the distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the extreme right tail,</v>

1696
01:26:58.821 --> 01:27:03.821
<v Speaker 2>if you hang out with billionaires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very often in order to get to a </v>

1697
01:27:03.821 --> 01:27:07.061
<v Speaker 2>billionaire status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to oppose large </v>

1698
01:27:07.061 --> 01:27:07.370
<v Speaker 2>numbers of people and say they're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and I'm right.</v>

1699
01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:12.560
<v Speaker 2>And then you also have to be right and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't even worse.</v>

1700
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:15.000
<v Speaker 2>You have to be disagree.</v>

1701
01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1702
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:21.610
<v Speaker 2>if I look at some of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that my friend peter teal can do that I </v>

1703
01:27:21.610 --> 01:27:22.610
<v Speaker 2>find very few people can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1704
01:27:22.611 --> 01:27:27.611
<v Speaker 2>can you hold a position?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you know two years from now </v>

1705
01:27:27.611 --> 01:27:27.650
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be proven right with two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of scorn,</v>

1706
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:30.680
<v Speaker 2>the average person is going to crumble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1707
01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Well that would also be partly trait </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism is that people have to be </v>

1708
01:27:35.710 --> 01:27:36.440
<v Speaker 2>able to tolerate that level of stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's very,</v>

1709
01:27:36.441 --> 01:27:38.090
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm trying to get at,</v>

1710
01:27:38.091 --> 01:27:43.091
<v Speaker 2>which is that people are looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>various reward structures and they're </v>

1711
01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:43.460
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1712
01:27:43.461 --> 01:27:48.461
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't match my particular set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>traits and I feel that my traits are </v>

1713
01:27:48.461 --> 01:27:48.461
<v Speaker 2>valuable in those traits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably are value,</v>

1714
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.680
<v Speaker 2>but we're not all destined to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond say or peter teal,</v>

1715
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:56.720
<v Speaker 2>but what seems to be happening that.</v>

1716
01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.640
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right,</v>

1717
01:27:58.641 --> 01:28:03.641
<v Speaker 2>but what seems to be happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like if you look at the </v>

1718
01:28:03.641 --> 01:28:06.701
<v Speaker 2>scandinavian countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more egalitarian scandinavian </v>

1719
01:28:06.701 --> 01:28:10.631
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where you're getting the most </v>

1720
01:28:10.631 --> 01:28:12.191
<v Speaker 2>radical assortment of occupational </v>
<v Speaker 2>status by gender and so I would say for </v>

1721
01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:14.630
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you tilt towards agreeableness,</v>

1722
01:28:14.631 --> 01:28:19.631
<v Speaker 2>which is actually a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictor of interest in people rather </v>

1723
01:28:19.631 --> 01:28:22.511
<v Speaker 2>than interest in things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest difference between men and </v>

1724
01:28:22.511 --> 01:28:22.690
<v Speaker 2>women seems to be an interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right manner,</v>

1725
01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:26.390
<v Speaker 2>reliably more interested in things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women more reliably interesting people.</v>

1726
01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.220
<v Speaker 2>The difference is one standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>deviation,</v>

1727
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:33.400
<v Speaker 2>so it's a big difference and what seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be happening in the scandinavian </v>

1728
01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.750
<v Speaker 2>countries is people are sorting </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves by their temperament,</v>

1729
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:38.630
<v Speaker 2>which is what they should do because </v>
<v Speaker 2>your temperament,</v>

1730
01:28:38.631 --> 01:28:42.320
<v Speaker 2>as you just pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predisposes you to success in some realm</v>

1731
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:43.580
<v Speaker 2>and not in others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1732
01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't get both failure and success </v>
<v Speaker 2>and failure,</v>

1733
01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:51.670
<v Speaker 2>so because women are on average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more agreeable and perhaps higher in </v>

1734
01:28:51.670 --> 01:28:56.021
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't obvious how that fits into the </v>

1735
01:28:56.021 --> 01:28:56.021
<v Speaker 2>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are more sensitive to the distress</v>

1736
01:28:56.021 --> 01:28:59.000
<v Speaker 2>of others and more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassionate in their care.</v>

1737
01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 2>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You open the landscape of</v>

1738
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:07.010
<v Speaker 3>competitiveness to women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They immediately dominate the health </v>

1739
01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:09.631
<v Speaker 3>care field and that's exactly what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened now and part of the problem </v>

1740
01:29:09.631 --> 01:29:13.191
<v Speaker 3>with that is that healthcare as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>occupation doesn't scale well like </v>

1741
01:29:13.191 --> 01:29:17.961
<v Speaker 3>engineering does for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's very difficult to generate </v>

1742
01:29:17.961 --> 01:29:21.381
<v Speaker 3>large fortunes in healthcare and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that skews the gender </v>

1743
01:29:21.381 --> 01:29:25.221
<v Speaker 3>distribution of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it looks like if we left people be </v>

1744
01:29:25.221 --> 01:29:28.591
<v Speaker 3>to the degree that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would sort themselves into </v>

1745
01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:31.341
<v Speaker 3>occupations by temperament and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be the question of like when when </v>

1746
01:29:31.801 --> 01:29:34.490
<v Speaker 3>we had our first child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a wrote a,</v>

1747
01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:38.160
<v Speaker 3>a practice where there was a rotation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ob gyn who deliver.</v>

1748
01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:40.740
<v Speaker 3>We had this one woman we were totally on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same page with.</v>

1749
01:29:40.741 --> 01:29:43.050
<v Speaker 3>We loved her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything about her was fantastic.</v>

1750
01:29:43.051 --> 01:29:48.051
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were simpatico and my wife's labor </v>

1751
01:29:48.051 --> 01:29:48.480
<v Speaker 3>went on and on and on and on.</v>

1752
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.150
<v Speaker 3>We've supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were getting closer and closer.</v>

1753
01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Finally sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This woman couldn't take it anymore and </v>

1754
01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:56.300
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to go to sleep,</v>

1755
01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:59.720
<v Speaker 3>and the guy that we dreaded the six foot</v>
<v Speaker 3>four guy with the bow tie who came from </v>

1756
01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:00.990
<v Speaker 3>a totally different era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We called them,</v>

1757
01:30:00.991 --> 01:30:05.991
<v Speaker 3>the undertaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes in and he says she's completely </v>

1758
01:30:05.991 --> 01:30:05.991
<v Speaker 3>blown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1759
01:30:05.991 --> 01:30:07.950
<v Speaker 3>where we are in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're barely dilated at all.</v>

1760
01:30:07.951 --> 01:30:10.550
<v Speaker 3>We need to deliver this child </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately via says area.</v>

1761
01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:11.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huh,</v>

1762
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:12.780
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1763
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:17.070
<v Speaker 3>the son of a bitch saved the situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>for my,</v>

1764
01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:19.140
<v Speaker 3>for my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife and my daughter.</v>

1765
01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is I didn't like them.</v>

1766
01:30:21.451 --> 01:30:26.451
<v Speaker 3>One absolutely mad that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that guy was a woman who diagnosed </v>

1767
01:30:26.451 --> 01:30:27.270
<v Speaker 3>our daughter with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with arthritis.</v>

1768
01:30:27.271 --> 01:30:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was really mad at her,</v>

1769
01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:34.460
<v Speaker 3>really mad at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was very disagreeable and she was </v>

1770
01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:34.680
<v Speaker 3>right and let's be very clear.</v>

1771
01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:37.230
<v Speaker 3>PaSsion and right are not the same as </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>

1772
01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:42.320
<v Speaker 3>The woman who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that we didn't have big </v>

1773
01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.970
<v Speaker 3>flipper babies for thalidomide commonly </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the United States was one woman who I</v>

1774
01:30:44.971 --> 01:30:49.950
<v Speaker 3>think went to university of chicago at </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 16 and she stood up and said,</v>

1775
01:30:49.951 --> 01:30:52.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the data on this drug and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>

1776
01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you drug companies have </v>
<v Speaker 3>done enough to prove to me that this is </v>

1777
01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:00.300
<v Speaker 3>safe to prescribing to pregnant woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she just put up her hand and stopped</v>

1778
01:31:00.301 --> 01:31:04.350
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't know what I'm going to use,</v>

1779
01:31:04.351 --> 01:31:07.920
<v Speaker 3>son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son of a bitch saved how many.</v>

1780
01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:11.130
<v Speaker 3>And then she's a national hero and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be celebrating.</v>

1781
01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:15.750
<v Speaker 3>The issue is is that it's not down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare,</v>

1782
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:18.520
<v Speaker 3>agreeable or disagreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>

1783
01:31:18.521 --> 01:31:23.521
<v Speaker 3>is that we now have so much information </v>
<v Speaker 3>about ourselves and about the </v>

1784
01:31:23.521 --> 01:31:27.351
<v Speaker 3>occupations and the reward structures </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there is a lot of structural </v>

1785
01:31:27.351 --> 01:31:30.951
<v Speaker 3>unfairness and there is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfairness about here's your endowment </v>

1786
01:31:30.951 --> 01:31:35.271
<v Speaker 3>and you were given different gifts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's a certain amount of luck </v>

1787
01:31:35.271 --> 01:31:38.250
<v Speaker 3>that we are all struggling with the idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have so much information and not</v>

1788
01:31:38.251 --> 01:31:43.251
<v Speaker 3>enough oppression to explain this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not necessarily happy with the </v>

1789
01:31:43.251 --> 01:31:43.251
<v Speaker 3>outcome.</v>

1790
01:31:43.251 --> 01:31:45.920
<v Speaker 3>We don't necessarily want to have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest conversation about,</v>

1791
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:46.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then,</v>

1792
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.390
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's another element to that too,</v>

1793
01:31:48.391 --> 01:31:53.391
<v Speaker 3>which is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question might be to what degree are</v>

1794
01:31:54.991 --> 01:31:58.650
<v Speaker 3>we required to tolerate a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ineradicable suffering?</v>

1795
01:31:58.830 --> 01:32:00.370
<v Speaker 3>Because that's the argument you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically</v>

1796
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:01.510
<v Speaker 2>making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying,</v>

1797
01:32:01.511 --> 01:32:02.770
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

1798
01:32:02.890 --> 01:32:05.230
<v Speaker 2>we can equalize and we can provide </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>

1799
01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:10.380
<v Speaker 2>And we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've hit the point of diminishing </v>

1800
01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:10.380
<v Speaker 2>returns now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everywhere obviously,</v>

1801
01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:14.870
<v Speaker 2>and and not in every sector,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could make the case that we've </v>

1802
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:17.611
<v Speaker 2>hit the point of diminishing returns and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stIll there is a tremenDous amount of </v>

1803
01:32:17.611 --> 01:32:20.460
<v Speaker 2>inequality and suffering so I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't find that acceptable at csu,</v>

1804
01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:25.520
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is the more you push to </v>
<v Speaker 2>remove that last bit of eradicable </v>

1805
01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:29.491
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more likely you are to produce a </v>

1806
01:32:29.491 --> 01:32:31.360
<v Speaker 2>worst kickback in another place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not an easy thing to contain in</v>

1807
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:33.250
<v Speaker 2>the fact is that we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing this,</v>

1808
01:32:33.251 --> 01:32:38.251
<v Speaker 2>whether an nbc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cbs or abc lIkes it and they can't do </v>

1809
01:32:38.251 --> 01:32:42.451
<v Speaker 2>anything about shutting this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation down until youtube or </v>

1810
01:32:42.451 --> 01:32:43.510
<v Speaker 2>twitter in a really decides to get heavy</v>
<v Speaker 2>handed and give us the boot.</v>

1811
01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:47.050
<v Speaker 2>And so fundamentally we don't sound like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're supposed to send.</v>

1812
01:32:47.051 --> 01:32:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Is the sound like an outright </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation?</v>

1813
01:32:48.941 --> 01:32:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Does it sound hyper conservative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1814
01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a very difficult picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the key problem is,</v>

1815
01:32:53.621 --> 01:32:58.621
<v Speaker 2>is that the only place that's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>explored is in these super luxurious </v>

1816
01:32:58.621 --> 01:33:01.120
<v Speaker 2>long form interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how people tune in.</v>

1817
01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Like when we went to tempe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were tracking these conversations</v>

1818
01:33:04.571 --> 01:33:06.960
<v Speaker 2>at a level that we're not tracking </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversational.</v>

1819
01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:09.740
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually care.</v>

1820
01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:15.940
<v Speaker 2>They know that the cognitive lego they </v>
<v Speaker 2>been handed is not capable of getting a </v>

1821
01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:17.410
<v Speaker 2>look surgically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what's happening at harvard.</v>

1822
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:19.810
<v Speaker 2>This is such an interesting example </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1823
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:21.550
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the entire landscape.</v>

1824
01:33:21.551 --> 01:33:25.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like the upshot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like the upshot of the,</v>

1825
01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:31.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the policies designed to produce </v>

1826
01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:34.300
<v Speaker 2>something approximating equity or at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least equality of opportunity.</v>

1827
01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:39.450
<v Speaker 2>The gerrymandering of the admissions </v>
<v Speaker 2>process has have the number of asians at</v>

1828
01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.360
<v Speaker 2>harvard and then harvard is of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>denying that strenuously.</v>

1829
01:33:43.570 --> 01:33:44.110
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1830
01:33:44.111 --> 01:33:49.111
<v Speaker 2>our selection method is too esoteric to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be captured properly by the statistics.</v>

1831
01:33:49.391 --> 01:33:50.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1832
01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.300
<v Speaker 2>that's really how you're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1833
01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.530
<v Speaker 2>There's nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no.</v>

1834
01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:58.840
<v Speaker 2>The harvard math department I think had </v>
<v Speaker 2>one female mathematician,</v>

1835
01:33:58.841 --> 01:34:02.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it doesn't have a senior female </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematician and I can be wrong and I'm</v>

1836
01:34:02.411 --> 01:34:05.290
<v Speaker 2>sure that the university is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put pressure.</v>

1837
01:34:05.291 --> 01:34:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with you guys?</v>

1838
01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:11.551
<v Speaker 2>Get with the program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The national science foundation is </v>

1839
01:34:11.551 --> 01:34:11.870
<v Speaker 2>trying to do that across the entire stem</v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines now and they're really gonna</v>

1840
01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:16.890
<v Speaker 2>muck up math by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by playIng around with this because the </v>

1841
01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:16.890
<v Speaker 2>data show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite interesting.</v>

1842
01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:19.450
<v Speaker 2>The data showed that if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>junior high,</v>

1843
01:34:19.930 --> 01:34:22.480
<v Speaker 2>there's approximately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some dispute about this.</v>

1844
01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:27.520
<v Speaker 2>There still might be evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a small percentage of a small </v>

1845
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:31.900
<v Speaker 2>advantage demand at the highest levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mathematical ability,</v>

1846
01:34:31.901 --> 01:34:36.901
<v Speaker 2>but I'll leave that aside for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more general data show that there's </v>

1847
01:34:36.901 --> 01:34:39.040
<v Speaker 2>plenty of gifted women and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of gifted girls.</v>

1848
01:34:39.041 --> 01:34:44.041
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of gifted boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the gifted boys are gifted in math </v>

1849
01:34:44.041 --> 01:34:47.581
<v Speaker 2>and not verbally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the gifted girls in math or </v>

1850
01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:50.131
<v Speaker 2>gifted verbally too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the consequences is that </v>

1851
01:34:50.131 --> 01:34:51.090
<v Speaker 2>because math is a very specialized </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>

1852
01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:52.510
<v Speaker 2>costs are higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1853
01:34:52.630 --> 01:34:53.140
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1854
01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:56.080
<v Speaker 2>The girls decide not to pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

1855
01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 2>is that math perfectly well tolerates</v>

1856
01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:02.390
<v Speaker 3>the females that it understands their </v>
<v Speaker 3>work and can't live without.</v>

1857
01:35:02.391 --> 01:35:03.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I think about emi,</v>

1858
01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.260
<v Speaker 3>nurturer or karen [inaudible] bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or do some mcdevitt,</v>

1859
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:09.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a huge number of women who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very well integrated,</v>

1860
01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:10.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1861
01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:12.380
<v Speaker 3>in physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like Lisa Randall,</v>

1862
01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think about there being </v>

1863
01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:17.920
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mathematicians are women.</v>

1864
01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Physicists like that result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this paper.</v>

1865
01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea,</v>

1866
01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:21.820
<v Speaker 3>thank god for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1867
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:24.400
<v Speaker 3>But the point that I'm trying to get at </v>
<v Speaker 3>here is,</v>

1868
01:35:24.401 --> 01:35:29.401
<v Speaker 3>is that there are still structural </v>
<v Speaker 3>barriers and there's probably something </v>

1869
01:35:29.401 --> 01:35:30.770
<v Speaker 3>that isn't a structural barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>

1870
01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:34.250
<v Speaker 3>the incentive structures and pay keeps </v>
<v Speaker 3>going down.</v>

1871
01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.250
<v Speaker 3>My guess is that you'll get more females</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1872
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:41.840
<v Speaker 3>which is a totally perverse effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been studied that you start going</v>

1873
01:35:41.841 --> 01:35:44.100
<v Speaker 3>into the female and minority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1874
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:47.660
<v Speaker 3>sectors when men feel that they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher,</v>

1875
01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity cost based on their level of</v>

1876
01:35:49.881 --> 01:35:54.881
<v Speaker 3>aggression that they can go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>management consulting or wall street or </v>

1877
01:35:54.881 --> 01:35:59.610
<v Speaker 3>a sheet question is we didn't need to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to have the real conversation </v>

1878
01:35:59.610 --> 01:36:00.290
<v Speaker 3>somewhere and it needs</v>

1879
01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:05.340
<v Speaker 2>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also need to have a conversation </v>

1880
01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:07.381
<v Speaker 2>about white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be advantageous to be paid </v>

1881
01:36:07.381 --> 01:36:10.141
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons it's it's </v>

1882
01:36:10.141 --> 01:36:10.141
<v Speaker 2>advantageous to be paid less is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>demands are less on you,</v>

1883
01:36:10.141 --> 01:36:15.000
<v Speaker 2>so if you have other things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do with your life than taking a </v>

1884
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:15.370
<v Speaker 2>job that pays less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This happens in law all the time.</v>

1885
01:36:15.490 --> 01:36:20.490
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked as a consultant for legal </v>

1886
01:36:20.490 --> 01:36:23.191
<v Speaker 2>companies for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for law firms for 10 years with lots of </v>

1887
01:36:23.191 --> 01:36:24.010
<v Speaker 2>high end women and I saw the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened all the time.</v>

1888
01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.770
<v Speaker 2>It end the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The law firms know this right?</v>

1889
01:36:26.771 --> 01:36:31.771
<v Speaker 2>To the core and all the women in the law</v>
<v Speaker 2>firms know what to almost all the women </v>

1890
01:36:31.771 --> 01:36:34.030
<v Speaker 2>bail out of the high end positions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>law in their early thirties.</v>

1891
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1892
01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly because if they're making,</v>

1893
01:36:38.291 --> 01:36:41.080
<v Speaker 2>say they're making 350 to $500,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>

1894
01:36:41.081 --> 01:36:46.081
<v Speaker 2>they're charging a thousand dollars an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour while the workload is absolutely </v>

1895
01:36:46.081 --> 01:36:49.141
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better be buIlding 2100 hours a </v>

1896
01:36:49.141 --> 01:36:49.141
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1897
01:36:49.141 --> 01:36:53.761
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to stay in that position</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're on call all the time and </v>

1898
01:36:53.761 --> 01:36:57.691
<v Speaker 2>you're basically working 16 hour days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so maybe maybe what you want to do </v>

1899
01:36:57.821 --> 01:37:01.690
<v Speaker 2>instead is find a nine to five job that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pays half as much,</v>

1900
01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:05.070
<v Speaker 2>but you get to have a light more </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotic inside of the universities.</v>

1901
01:37:05.071 --> 01:37:10.071
<v Speaker 2>And here's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what nobody really wants to </v>

1902
01:37:10.071 --> 01:37:11.860
<v Speaker 2>discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The great danger according to many of my</v>

1903
01:37:11.861 --> 01:37:13.000
<v Speaker 2>colleagues in</v>

1904
01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:18.260
<v Speaker 3>placed well placed in in high level a </v>
<v Speaker 3>science departments,</v>

1905
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:23.210
<v Speaker 3>is they say the followup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know which females are going to</v>

1906
01:37:23.211 --> 01:37:28.211
<v Speaker 3>discover the pleasures of family after </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've invested in.</v>

1907
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is is that sometime in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their mid thirties,</v>

1908
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:34.940
<v Speaker 3>some number of of women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think discover,</v>

1909
01:37:34.941 --> 01:37:39.941
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been so fulfilled is when </v>

1910
01:37:39.941 --> 01:37:39.941
<v Speaker 3>I've had my child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some women say,</v>

1911
01:37:39.941 --> 01:37:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to get back to the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1912
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:46.030
<v Speaker 3>And these are two different reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by pushing the point of commitment </v>

1913
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:50.440
<v Speaker 3>farther and farther towards middle age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is you're actually </v>

1914
01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:55.181
<v Speaker 3>screening out the fact that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know which people you're going to invest</v>

1915
01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:58.470
<v Speaker 3>in and they're going to decide that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have something more interesting to do in</v>

1916
01:37:58.471 --> 01:38:03.471
<v Speaker 3>their life in terms of work or that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Compelled because also has to do with </v>

1917
01:38:03.471 --> 01:38:04.920
<v Speaker 3>aging parents right now.</v>

1918
01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact is that women are more </v>

1919
01:38:09.970 --> 01:38:12.051
<v Speaker 3>conscientious with respect to child </v>
<v Speaker 3>rearing and with aging parents </v>

1920
01:38:12.051 --> 01:38:15.351
<v Speaker 3>generically than men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so part of the game and a function </v>

1921
01:38:15.351 --> 01:38:18.801
<v Speaker 3>of being agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably a function of fitness where </v>

1922
01:38:18.801 --> 01:38:20.340
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea is that uncertain,</v>

1923
01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 3>uncertain paternity and maternity means </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in a highly k selected species,</v>

1924
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.750
<v Speaker 3>females are going to be ever more </v>
<v Speaker 3>focused on,</v>

1925
01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.610
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1926
01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:34.640
<v Speaker 3>on kin in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's the reason that the </v>

1927
01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.951
<v Speaker 3>differences in agreeableness evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even thought about that because </v>

1928
01:38:36.951 --> 01:38:37.970
<v Speaker 3>while that could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought about that,</v>

1929
01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:42.980
<v Speaker 3>that's likely explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the issue that fundamentally we </v>

1930
01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:45.690
<v Speaker 3>would defer tenure as a means of </v>
<v Speaker 3>screening out,</v>

1931
01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:51.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>females who are going to invest in </v>

1932
01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:51.020
<v Speaker 3>fertility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is very interesting.</v>

1933
01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:51.250
<v Speaker 3>If you look at feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1934
01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:56.480
<v Speaker 3>scientists in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have women who had four kids and </v>

1935
01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:59.300
<v Speaker 3>they spent a life in science and very </v>
<v Speaker 3>often you look,</v>

1936
01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:00.780
<v Speaker 3>you poke and prod at these things.</v>

1937
01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an army of servants because </v>

1938
01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:06.330
<v Speaker 3>there was wealth in the family in a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>often.</v>

1939
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:08.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what,</v>

1940
01:39:08.250 --> 01:39:13.250
<v Speaker 3>what are my claim is if you really want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do something profound for women in </v>

1941
01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:17.421
<v Speaker 3>technical subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should pay them more and you should </v>

1942
01:39:17.421 --> 01:39:19.020
<v Speaker 3>get them help in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't work in law.</v>

1943
01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the issue because to some extent</v>

1944
01:39:21.421 --> 01:39:23.220
<v Speaker 3>it's a question of fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of them,</v>

1945
01:39:23.221 --> 01:39:25.380
<v Speaker 3>most of the women that I work with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all have nannies.</v>

1946
01:39:25.381 --> 01:39:27.480
<v Speaker 3>They outsourced all their domestic </v>
<v Speaker 3>duties.</v>

1947
01:39:27.481 --> 01:39:32.481
<v Speaker 3>Like that was covered man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was part of all lemme tell you </v>

1948
01:39:32.481 --> 01:39:35.840
<v Speaker 3>more successful group of people than I </v>
<v Speaker 3>do because very often had the money for </v>

1949
01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.970
<v Speaker 3>if when two people can't get jobs </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and contiguous states,</v>

1950
01:39:39.450 --> 01:39:39.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1951
01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:45.160
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a job in Oklahoma and he's got </v>

1952
01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:45.810
<v Speaker 3>a job in Alabama and we try to see each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other two weekends a month.</v>

1953
01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:49.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things have gone wildly off the rails,</v>

1954
01:39:49.411 --> 01:39:54.411
<v Speaker 3>but the key point is that employers are </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing games,</v>

1955
01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:59.910
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out this change in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Life cycle where some women are very,</v>

1956
01:39:59.911 --> 01:40:04.110
<v Speaker 3>very happy doing kickass work throughout</v>
<v Speaker 3>their life.</v>

1957
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:06.210
<v Speaker 3>maybe they can figure out how to do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1958
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:07.740
<v Speaker 3>Some of them can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them can.</v>

1959
01:40:07.741 --> 01:40:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty hard to do.</v>

1960
01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:10.950
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty hard to do at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It helps if you have money.</v>

1961
01:40:11.010 --> 01:40:12.150
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does help,</v>

1962
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:18.470
<v Speaker 3>but we are not owning up to what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are these games and what are these </v>

1963
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:21.280
<v Speaker 3>differences and where should we be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where should we be subsidized?</v>

1964
01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:24.920
<v Speaker 3>We're also not owning up to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that gender difference in pay isn't</v>

1965
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:29.930
<v Speaker 3>a gender difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mother difference because women </v>

1966
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:32.090
<v Speaker 3>take the big hit and their salaries when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they decide to have kids that no,</v>

1967
01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:36.090
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that no one and nothing is ever just</v>

1968
01:40:36.091 --> 01:40:36.570
<v Speaker 3>one thing.</v>

1969
01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the whole thing about equal pay for </v>

1970
01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:41.660
<v Speaker 3>equal work and seventy five cents on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar,</v>

1971
01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:45.860
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that when you poke and prod at that </v>

1972
01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:48.870
<v Speaker 3>there is an unfairness and there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>misrepresentation.</v>

1973
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:53.930
<v Speaker 3>And the point is we're not comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 3>having open conversation about do we </v>

1974
01:40:55.601 --> 01:41:00.601
<v Speaker 3>want to subsidize people based on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>different than my wife has a really </v>

1975
01:41:00.601 --> 01:41:00.601
<v Speaker 3>interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>

1976
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:05.790
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in the fish area in </v>

1977
01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:07.920
<v Speaker 3>equivalence between male and female is </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategies were males tend to be the </v>

1978
01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:07.920
<v Speaker 3>high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high return,</v>

1979
01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.720
<v Speaker 3>moderate risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate return.</v>

1980
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:15.030
<v Speaker 3>There was a time when wars were common </v>
<v Speaker 3>in men got called up and women didn't </v>

1981
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:17.280
<v Speaker 3>have as high end prospects and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's working in the fields or you</v>

1982
01:41:17.281 --> 01:41:18.880
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>washing clothes at home.</v>

1983
01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:24.240
<v Speaker 3>And then her point it's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting is knowledge work became </v>

1984
01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:27.280
<v Speaker 3>wildly more fulfillinG very quickly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of wars,</v>

1985
01:41:27.370 --> 01:41:29.530
<v Speaker 3>and this is my identity to it has gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1986
01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:35.120
<v Speaker 3>And so suddenly it's much better to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>male in her way of thinking than it is </v>

1987
01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.550
<v Speaker 3>female in a way that was never true </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1988
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:40.750
<v Speaker 3>And so there is a novelty effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that,</v>

1989
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:46.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge work is outpacing the </v>

1990
01:41:46.090 --> 01:41:47.820
<v Speaker 3>fulfillment of child rearing at some </v>
<v Speaker 3>level because the,</v>

1991
01:41:47.821 --> 01:41:52.480
<v Speaker 3>the problems that you can solve if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're well placed to do so,</v>

1992
01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:57.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have increased in number and they're </v>

1993
01:41:57.930 --> 01:42:00.301
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very fulfilling and there are also </v>

1994
01:42:00.301 --> 01:42:02.851
<v Speaker 3>disproportionately lucrative at least in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some situations and disproportionately </v>

1995
01:42:02.851 --> 01:42:02.851
<v Speaker 3>lucrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>

1996
01:42:02.851 --> 01:42:04.690
<v Speaker 3>I do think that one of the things We </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do,</v>

1997
01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:05.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1998
01:42:05.850 --> 01:42:10.850
<v Speaker 3>look at the Vietnam war memorial and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got like eight female names on it and </v>

1999
01:42:12.461 --> 01:42:13.180
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2000
01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:14.680
<v Speaker 3>george,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tom,</v>

2001
01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Chad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2002
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:21.470
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is this forgetting of the fact </v>

2003
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:25.200
<v Speaker 3>that maleness has this huge downside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the high risk part of the high </v>

2004
01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:25.720
<v Speaker 3>risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high return strategy.</v>

2005
01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.920
<v Speaker 3>Know you're point about interest in </v>
<v Speaker 3>things over people at my local pinball.</v>

2006
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:33.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>san francisco would,</v>

2007
01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:35.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take my son there,</v>

2008
01:42:35.771 --> 01:42:40.771
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a woman's room and they're </v>

2009
01:42:40.771 --> 01:42:41.200
<v Speaker 3>clearly pinball machines that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>intended to get a female audience,</v>

2010
01:42:41.201 --> 01:42:44.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's like 20 to one males too few </v>
<v Speaker 3>meals because it's,</v>

2011
01:42:44.890 --> 01:42:48.640
<v Speaker 3>it's this kind of robotic activity where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just putting money into a machine</v>

2012
01:42:48.641 --> 01:42:50.740
<v Speaker 3>and you're watching a ball and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>flashing lights.</v>

2013
01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:55.980
<v Speaker 3>I find it quite entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I look at myself and I think you're </v>

2014
01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:55.980
<v Speaker 3>saying cigs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2015
01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:57.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm out of my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2016
01:42:57.731 --> 01:42:58.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting too,</v>

2017
01:42:58.901 --> 01:43:03.901
<v Speaker 3>is that that high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high return strategy is also not that </v>

2018
01:43:03.901 --> 01:43:08.431
<v Speaker 3>common among men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that the people who do the </v>

2019
01:43:08.431 --> 01:43:09.400
<v Speaker 3>high risk high return strategy are </v>
<v Speaker 3>disproportionately men.</v>

2020
01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:14.700
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to struggle with is that like </v>

2021
01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:16.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a small number of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>hyper productive in any discipline.</v>

2022
01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:18.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the price's law phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you see,</v>

2023
01:43:18.401 --> 01:43:20.080
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in scientific publishing,</v>

2024
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:23.680
<v Speaker 3>the median number of publications for </v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women is very similar,</v>

2025
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:27.240
<v Speaker 3>immediate number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the people who poe,</v>

2026
01:43:27.370 --> 01:43:32.180
<v Speaker 3>who hyper publish are almost all made </v>
<v Speaker 3>that telimans of zach's.</v>

2027
01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:37.460
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gas box of science and then the </v>

2028
01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:40.540
<v Speaker 3>painful part of that is is that it's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people it looks like it's the people who</v>

2029
01:43:40.541 --> 01:43:42.610
<v Speaker 3>are hyper productive that drive the </v>
<v Speaker 3>science forward,</v>

2030
01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:45.460
<v Speaker 3>so the median types are actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat irrelevant.</v>

2031
01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:49.240
<v Speaker 3>It's only the hyper productive people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that count and their disproportionate.</v>

2032
01:43:49.241 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 3>But even then I've heard you on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

2033
01:43:52.071 --> 01:43:57.071
<v Speaker 3>I want to take issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is kurt girdle hyper productive or was </v>

2034
01:43:57.071 --> 01:43:58.880
<v Speaker 3>he and I would say yes he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he publish very much?</v>

2035
01:43:58.881 --> 01:44:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2036
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:05.530
<v Speaker 3>quantity isn't the one good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so correlated at point </v>

2037
01:44:06.891 --> 01:44:10.220
<v Speaker 3>three with citation count independent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>numBer of publication count is.</v>

2038
01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:11.240
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we've got.</v>

2039
01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 3>We've got a really dangerous problem in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2040
01:44:14.451 --> 01:44:19.451
<v Speaker 3>The metrics that we've developed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've put way too much on and you know </v>

2041
01:44:19.451 --> 01:44:19.451
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>

2042
01:44:19.451 --> 01:44:21.020
<v Speaker 3>You could say that that's a universal </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

2043
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Be careful what you measure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2044
01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:25.630
<v Speaker 3>And I mean it's hard to measure </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific impact with any degree.</v>

2045
01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:28.700
<v Speaker 3>This is why I'm so an unpopular in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

2046
01:44:28.701 --> 01:44:33.701
<v Speaker 3>which is I just believe in giving slush </v>
<v Speaker 3>funds to highly disagreeable people of </v>

2047
01:44:33.701 --> 01:44:38.111
<v Speaker 3>high achievement and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go figure out who you want to fund </v>

2048
01:44:38.111 --> 01:44:40.520
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of this stuff can't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>justified by any metric,</v>

2049
01:44:40.521 --> 01:44:45.521
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm big on the selection end </v>

2050
01:44:45.521 --> 01:44:47.940
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should you select qualified people and </v>

2051
01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:47.940
<v Speaker 3>leave them the hell alone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2052
01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:49.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean I actually working together on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2053
01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:54.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My take on this is that the best way to </v>

2054
01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:56.771
<v Speaker 3>get radical progress is stopped worrying</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the median individual worried </v>

2055
01:44:56.771 --> 01:45:00.781
<v Speaker 3>about the tiny number of people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>break new ground for everybody and then </v>

2056
01:45:00.781 --> 01:45:03.410
<v Speaker 3>you find that a hell of a thing for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftist to say,</v>

2057
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:08.830
<v Speaker 3>but I mean this goes back to and back </v>
<v Speaker 3>those back to the problem I laid out at </v>

2058
01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:12.821
<v Speaker 3>the beginning is that if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>pursue things of value in a social </v>

2059
01:45:12.821 --> 01:45:16.751
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna produce a hierarchy and </v>

2060
01:45:16.751 --> 01:45:16.751
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be hyper productivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the pinnacle of the hierarchy.</v>

2061
01:45:16.751 --> 01:45:19.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you want to produce things,</v>

2062
01:45:19.101 --> 01:45:20.720
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem you have to contend </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2063
01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:26.140
<v Speaker 3>And so it is the case that in most </v>
<v Speaker 3>fields that are attempting to advance </v>

2064
01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:30.881
<v Speaker 3>rapidly that it's a very tiny proportion</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people who are doing the advancing </v>

2065
01:45:30.881 --> 01:45:30.881
<v Speaker 3>and how could it be otherwise?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2066
01:45:30.881 --> 01:45:32.720
<v Speaker 3>but because oTherwise everybody would </v>
<v Speaker 3>find the advanced.</v>

2067
01:45:32.721 --> 01:45:33.170
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2068
01:45:33.171 --> 01:45:35.060
<v Speaker 3>I have this trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a good measure.</v>

2069
01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:35.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another one.</v>

2070
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:39.980
<v Speaker 3>You asked the leaders in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2071
01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:44.900
<v Speaker 3>effectively who they would block,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they will not publicly short.</v>

2072
01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:49.010
<v Speaker 3>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2073
01:45:49.650 --> 01:45:51.590
<v Speaker 3>joe's on some crazy tangent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

2074
01:45:51.710 --> 01:45:54.790
<v Speaker 3>he's wasting the department's resources </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

2075
01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:00.460
<v Speaker 3>jane fundamentally doesn't play well on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this team and the,</v>

2076
01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:02.480
<v Speaker 3>I think we need to send her a strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>message.</v>

2077
01:46:03.170 --> 01:46:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why don't we say something </v>

2078
01:46:08.170 --> 01:46:08.170
<v Speaker 3>publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

2079
01:46:08.170 --> 01:46:08.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say that.</v>

2080
01:46:08.170 --> 01:46:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Why is it you don't want to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2081
01:46:09.230 --> 01:46:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're frightened that that </v>

2082
01:46:14.230 --> 01:46:14.230
<v Speaker 3>person has you on the losing end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

2083
01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:17.420
<v Speaker 3>So you're tryIng to block that person in</v>
<v Speaker 3>private,</v>

2084
01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:22.690
<v Speaker 3>but you won't short them in public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you use the people who fundamentally </v>

2085
01:46:22.690 --> 01:46:26.951
<v Speaker 3>are the regular establishment to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you who the most dangerous people are.</v>

2086
01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:32.300
<v Speaker 3>When you get those people money and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to decrease transparency and </v>

2087
01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:36.140
<v Speaker 3>accountability because giving people </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>

2088
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:41.410
<v Speaker 3>The old part of this bargain was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the best paid career in the </v>

2089
01:46:41.410 --> 01:46:42.110
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do end up with freedom.</v>

2090
01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:45.380
<v Speaker 3>The ability to know is the and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone and that's gone.</v>

2091
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:47.220
<v Speaker 3>They ethics committees have killed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2092
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:49.380
<v Speaker 3>my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the accuracies if killed,</v>

2093
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:54.390
<v Speaker 3>it's gotten so bad man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is our job to rally for </v>

2094
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:58.140
<v Speaker 3>unaccountability at a very high level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lack of transparencY.</v>

2095
01:46:58.380 --> 01:46:59.490
<v Speaker 3>You can laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's.</v>

2096
01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:01.410
<v Speaker 3>Let's go through this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2097
01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.680
<v Speaker 3>The fact is when you have a slush fund </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can make decisions that you </v>

2098
01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:09.000
<v Speaker 3>don't have to justify based on an h </v>
<v Speaker 3>index or a citation counter,</v>

2099
01:47:09.001 --> 01:47:14.001
<v Speaker 3>any of these poison metrics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get people who are able to make use </v>

2100
01:47:14.001 --> 01:47:16.530
<v Speaker 3>of what we still have over places like </v>
<v Speaker 3>China.</v>

2101
01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:19.830
<v Speaker 3>That's What we have over a place like </v>
<v Speaker 3>China is we're a little bit richer.</v>

2102
01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:21.760
<v Speaker 3>not much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe so we can,</v>

2103
01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:24.390
<v Speaker 3>but we're freer and that's mIddle </v>
<v Speaker 3>finger.</v>

2104
01:47:24.810 --> 01:47:26.580
<v Speaker 3>That's less middle finger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2105
01:47:26.581 --> 01:47:29.060
<v Speaker 3>that's disagreeableness there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2106
01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.500
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean you were the one who knows me</v>

2107
01:47:31.501 --> 01:47:35.070
<v Speaker 3>over dinner over my tenure is necessary </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you could say,</v>

2108
01:47:35.071 --> 01:47:36.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 95,</v>

2109
01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:42.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could say 95 percent of people </v>

2110
01:47:42.110 --> 01:47:45.021
<v Speaker 3>waste tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take advantage of it and I would </v>

2111
01:47:45.021 --> 01:47:45.021
<v Speaker 3>say that's fine.</v>

2112
01:47:45.021 --> 01:47:48.080
<v Speaker 3>As long as the five percent who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking advantage of it have their </v>

2113
01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:50.350
<v Speaker 3>freedom hyper produCed and justify all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of them.</v>

2114
01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:53.150
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has real tenure because real </v>
<v Speaker 3>tenure,</v>

2115
01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:58.190
<v Speaker 3>academic freedom was first of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrificed by the association of </v>

2116
01:47:58.190 --> 01:48:01.911
<v Speaker 3>american universities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aau in 1953 at the height of the cold </v>

2117
01:48:01.911 --> 01:48:03.900
<v Speaker 3>war in the face of the rosenberg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's so fIrst of all,</v>

2118
01:48:03.930 --> 01:48:05.190
<v Speaker 3>let's be very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very honest.</v>

2119
01:48:05.191 --> 01:48:10.191
<v Speaker 3>The trade group that represents the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nation's top institutions of higher </v>

2120
01:48:10.191 --> 01:48:13.671
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the research universities fucked up and </v>

2121
01:48:13.671 --> 01:48:15.420
<v Speaker 3>they killed something and I don't swear </v>
<v Speaker 3>very often.</v>

2122
01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:19.730
<v Speaker 3>This is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sacrificed academic freedom,</v>

2123
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:23.310
<v Speaker 3>freedom on an altar when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>facing something like we're,</v>

2124
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:27.960
<v Speaker 3>we're facing with left carthy is right </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were facing real mccarthyism,</v>

2125
01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:32.550
<v Speaker 3>they buckled and the einsteins of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world stood up.</v>

2126
01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:36.690
<v Speaker 3>There's a beautiful testimony of a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was facing senator mccarthy.</v>

2127
01:48:37.230 --> 01:48:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

2128
01:48:38.011 --> 01:48:43.011
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking to my friend albert </v>

2129
01:48:43.011 --> 01:48:43.011
<v Speaker 3>einstein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see in the transcript.</v>

2130
01:48:43.011 --> 01:48:43.011
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

2131
01:48:43.011 --> 01:48:45.150
<v Speaker 3>your friend albert einstein?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And einstein said,</v>

2132
01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:50.151
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be prepared to lose your </v>

2133
01:48:50.151 --> 01:48:53.001
<v Speaker 3>salary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose your livelihood if you're going to </v>

2134
01:48:53.001 --> 01:48:55.341
<v Speaker 3>be a true intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the fact of the matter is disagree </v>

2135
01:48:55.341 --> 01:48:57.120
<v Speaker 3>ability needs to make a massive warring </v>
<v Speaker 3>comeback.</v>

2136
01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I think is just </v>

2137
01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:05.751
<v Speaker 3>fascinating is how many top departments </v>
<v Speaker 3>have invited bret weinstein to give a </v>

2138
01:49:05.751 --> 01:49:10.371
<v Speaker 3>talk on evolutionary theory after </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching him tossed out by the radical </v>

2139
01:49:10.371 --> 01:49:12.060
<v Speaker 3>departments?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Expect the answer to that is zero.</v>

2140
01:49:12.210 --> 01:49:15.420
<v Speaker 3>It's almost zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that it may be zero.</v>

2141
01:49:15.690 --> 01:49:18.420
<v Speaker 3>So is so with lindsay shepherd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her claim for,</v>

2142
01:49:18.421 --> 01:49:23.421
<v Speaker 3>with wilfred laurier is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversy there is controversy has </v>

2143
01:49:23.421 --> 01:49:24.150
<v Speaker 3>made her permanently unemployable with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I read that,</v>

2144
01:49:24.151 --> 01:49:25.740
<v Speaker 3>I thought that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's correct,</v>

2145
01:49:25.741 --> 01:49:30.741
<v Speaker 3>because no hiring committee will take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>risk on anybody touched who did green </v>

2146
01:49:30.741 --> 01:49:30.741
<v Speaker 3>fluorescent protein.</v>

2147
01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was supposed to get a nobel prize for</v>

2148
01:49:32.881 --> 01:49:37.881
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was acknowledged by the three guys </v>

2149
01:49:37.881 --> 01:49:37.881
<v Speaker 3>who did as the fourth guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they flew them to Sweden.</v>

2150
01:49:37.881 --> 01:49:39.810
<v Speaker 3>And what is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He immediately,</v>

2151
01:49:39.811 --> 01:49:44.811
<v Speaker 3>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was driving a shuttle bus in </v>

2152
01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:44.811
<v Speaker 3>huntsville,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alabama.</v>

2153
01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:48.470
<v Speaker 3>One year later after the New York times </v>
<v Speaker 3>a covered doug pressure story was still </v>

2154
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:50.530
<v Speaker 3>driving a shuttle bus in huntsville,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alabama,</v>

2155
01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:55.890
<v Speaker 3>talking about margo tool at mit who </v>
<v Speaker 3>stood up against david baltimore and a </v>

2156
01:49:55.890 --> 01:49:57.600
<v Speaker 3>theresa and issue shikari,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2157
01:49:58.150 --> 01:50:00.730
<v Speaker 3>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now my question is,</v>

2158
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:03.160
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are the universities?</v>

2159
01:50:03.161 --> 01:50:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Is it the university of chicago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it down to the university of chicago?</v>

2160
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Where are the places?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicago?</v>

2161
01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:10.390
<v Speaker 3>If you're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2162
01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:14.950
<v Speaker 3>w w we need you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need fundamentally strong departments</v>

2163
01:50:14.951 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 3>and weak administrations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is absolutely critical.</v>

2164
01:50:18.041 --> 01:50:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Is that anything on that's on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2165
01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:23.860
<v Speaker 3>we need an accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need strong professors,</v>

2166
01:50:23.890 --> 01:50:26.920
<v Speaker 3>we need strong departments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need weak administrations.</v>

2167
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:29.650
<v Speaker 3>We need to get people tenure radically </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>

2168
01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:31.570
<v Speaker 3>like in their twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late twenties,</v>

2169
01:50:31.571 --> 01:50:36.571
<v Speaker 3>early thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need when people have the ability to </v>

2170
01:50:36.571 --> 01:50:39.841
<v Speaker 3>make great new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not appreciated and the fact </v>

2171
01:50:39.841 --> 01:50:43.771
<v Speaker 3>that fundamentally nobody can hear bret </v>
<v Speaker 3>weinstein who has great interesting </v>

2172
01:50:43.771 --> 01:50:45.400
<v Speaker 3>theories and you want to shoot them down</v>
<v Speaker 3>by all means,</v>

2173
01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Speaker 3>but you won't invite him to give a </v>
<v Speaker 3>seminar on his,</v>

2174
01:50:47.770 --> 01:50:52.770
<v Speaker 3>on his work at a time like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is absolute madness and I'm so you </v>

2175
01:50:52.770 --> 01:50:54.250
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a privilege to be able to deal with</v>

2176
01:50:54.251 --> 01:50:59.251
<v Speaker 3>our tiny group of people who can </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually open their throat and say find </v>

2177
01:50:59.251 --> 01:51:00.940
<v Speaker 3>a much larger audience than he would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have gotten any other way.</v>

2178
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what I was gonna say.</v>

2179
01:51:02.291 --> 01:51:07.291
<v Speaker 3>Maybe marketing this all the way back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then let's do one more thing and </v>

2180
01:51:07.291 --> 01:51:10.561
<v Speaker 3>then we're going to bring in shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that brings us back to where </v>

2181
01:51:10.561 --> 01:51:10.561
<v Speaker 3>we started about this.</v>

2182
01:51:10.561 --> 01:51:13.450
<v Speaker 3>The speed of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of people that can listen and</v>

2183
01:51:13.451 --> 01:51:15.910
<v Speaker 3>watch and all of that and that what </v>
<v Speaker 3>brett may find.</v>

2184
01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:21.090
<v Speaker 3>I just brought bread up in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sold out comedy club in bellevue and he </v>

2185
01:51:21.090 --> 01:51:22.300
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I just mentioned his name,</v>

2186
01:51:22.301 --> 01:51:27.301
<v Speaker 3>he got a standing ovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of those people edit journals </v>

2187
01:51:27.301 --> 01:51:27.760
<v Speaker 3>of evolutionary theory so we have to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to them.</v>

2188
01:51:27.761 --> 01:51:32.761
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different set that are watching </v>

2189
01:51:32.761 --> 01:51:34.660
<v Speaker 3>this right now to be sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something to be said even so on.</v>

2190
01:51:34.670 --> 01:51:39.670
<v Speaker 3>The question front is rough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something to be said for </v>

2191
01:51:39.670 --> 01:51:42.451
<v Speaker 3>being able to bring your scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>expertise to a mass audience who are </v>

2192
01:51:42.451 --> 01:51:43.570
<v Speaker 3>actually interested in the content of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your discourse,</v>

2193
01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:45.380
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not saying it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2194
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:47.860
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the revolution in the journals that</v>

2195
01:51:47.861 --> 01:51:50.140
<v Speaker 3>might be necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not nothing.</v>

2196
01:51:50.410 --> 01:51:51.140
<v Speaker 3>It's and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2197
01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:51.750
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2198
01:51:51.751 --> 01:51:55.300
<v Speaker 3>it looks like there's the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing these things directly to a mass</v>

2199
01:51:55.301 --> 01:51:56.390
<v Speaker 3>audience that's appreciated.</v>

2200
01:51:56.390 --> 01:52:01.390
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that nobody gets about </v>

2201
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:03.460
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I spend my time attacking a most</v>

2202
01:52:03.461 --> 01:52:08.461
<v Speaker 3>of the things I'm trying to save.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to save the New York times from </v>

2203
01:52:09.041 --> 01:52:10.900
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to save the university.</v>

2204
01:52:10.901 --> 01:52:13.200
<v Speaker 3>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 to do,</v>

2205
01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:18.340
<v Speaker 3>you don't have enough time left to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>spoken like a baby boomer and my friend,</v>

2206
01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:20.470
<v Speaker 3>he might know kurzweil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2207
01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:26.140
<v Speaker 3>what we need to do is either cure it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill it.</v>

2208
01:52:27.190 --> 01:52:29.380
<v Speaker 3>These things need to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can let it kill itself,</v>

2209
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:33.070
<v Speaker 3>which it seems to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have time for that.</v>

2210
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:34.770
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not a pretty death.</v>

2211
01:52:34.810 --> 01:52:37.210
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the fact of the matter is,</v>

2212
01:52:37.211 --> 01:52:40.510
<v Speaker 3>is that it's crowding out what's next </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so fundamentally,</v>

2213
01:52:40.511 --> 01:52:42.310
<v Speaker 3>if it can be saved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they can be saved,</v>

2214
01:52:42.311 --> 01:52:44.620
<v Speaker 3>they need to be saved and if they can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be saved,</v>

2215
01:52:44.621 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 3>if they want to keep their</v>

2216
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:51.150
<v Speaker 2>finger on the scales and push everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this direction and the cowardice is a</v>

2217
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:53.540
<v Speaker 2>palpable everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2218
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:56.570
<v Speaker 2>it's important that they stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowding out what's next?</v>

2219
01:52:56.990 --> 01:53:00.260
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's the major </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision and you know,</v>

2220
01:53:00.261 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 2>quite the thing to market the </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketplace might make that decision for</v>

2221
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:03.680
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

2222
01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:05.480
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'll be fast.</v>

2223
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'd be fast enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

2224
01:53:07.521 --> 01:53:09.620
<v Speaker 2>let's do one other thing before shapiro </v>
<v Speaker 2>is gonna.</v>

2225
01:53:09.621 --> 01:53:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Join us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna.</v>

2226
01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Take a little break and have lunch and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then shapiro is going to jump in here.</v>

2227
01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:18.100
<v Speaker 2>So I thought this would be a good segue </v>
<v Speaker 2>too to him because we haven't done that </v>

2228
01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:20.330
<v Speaker 2>much political snap right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>

2229
01:53:20.630 --> 01:53:23.060
<v Speaker 2>is this a political movement?</v>

2230
01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Is this the beginnings of a political </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement?</v>

2231
01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:28.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2232
01:53:28.351 --> 01:53:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what it is is the,</v>

2233
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:33.350
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that conduct,</v>

2234
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:38.090
<v Speaker 2>it's the conducting of proper political </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse and maybe you could say,</v>

2235
01:53:38.091 --> 01:53:43.091
<v Speaker 2>well it would be a political movement to</v>
<v Speaker 2>foster the conducting of proper </v>

2236
01:53:43.091 --> 01:53:44.330
<v Speaker 2>political discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThAt's possible,</v>

2237
01:53:44.331 --> 01:53:47.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's a strange political movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a political movement that's</v>

2238
01:53:47.151 --> 01:53:49.640
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on process rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

2239
01:53:49.730 --> 01:53:50.480
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

2240
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:51.990
<v Speaker 2>than content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2241
01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that partly what I'm doIng in my</v>

2242
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:58.910
<v Speaker 2>tour is the fostering of genuine </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse,</v>

2243
01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:04.600
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's as political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think of that as a political </v>

2244
01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:07.331
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of it as a psychological </v>

2245
01:54:07.331 --> 01:54:07.331
<v Speaker 2>movement or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2246
01:54:07.331 --> 01:54:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Or it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2247
01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:12.380
<v Speaker 2>our constitutional principles in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political domain.</v>

2248
01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I would say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're outside the political domain </v>

2249
01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:17.440
<v Speaker 2>because they're axiom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're inside some other domain.</v>

2250
01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:20.120
<v Speaker 2>They're inside a philosophical domain or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a theological domain,</v>

2251
01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:24.710
<v Speaker 2>and I think a discussion that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with proper political process</v>

2252
01:54:24.711 --> 01:54:29.711
<v Speaker 2>isn't a political discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a meta political </v>

2253
01:54:29.711 --> 01:54:29.711
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be what a better way to ask the</v>

2254
01:54:29.711 --> 01:54:34.271
<v Speaker 2>question and then b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we just need a political party or a </v>

2255
01:54:34.271 --> 01:54:37.691
<v Speaker 2>political group or a politician or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever to just pick up on this and </v>

2256
01:54:37.691 --> 01:54:40.100
<v Speaker 2>then incorporate it so that it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement in and of itself.</v>

2257
01:54:40.101 --> 01:54:40.900
<v Speaker 2>I understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2258
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went and talked to,</v>

2259
01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:43.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2260
01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:45.830
<v Speaker 2>what's the name of that group turning </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in America?</v>

2261
01:54:45.831 --> 01:54:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I went and talked to everybody who was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>turning point usa.</v>

2262
01:54:48.351 --> 01:54:50.480
<v Speaker 2>I went and talked to their women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting.</v>

2263
01:54:50.481 --> 01:54:52.670
<v Speaker 2>They had about 1200 women down in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2264
01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:57.970
<v Speaker 2>we were in dallas and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>I recommended to them was that instead </v>

2265
01:54:57.970 --> 01:55:00.530
<v Speaker 2>of concentrating on the content of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>radiology,</v>

2266
01:55:00.531 --> 01:55:02.230
<v Speaker 2>because they're branding themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some senses,</v>

2267
01:55:02.231 --> 01:55:07.231
<v Speaker 2>the conservative movement that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>devote themselves to educating </v>

2268
01:55:07.231 --> 01:55:10.811
<v Speaker 2>themselves as much as they possibly can </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're going to produce a much </v>

2269
01:55:10.811 --> 01:55:15.671
<v Speaker 2>bigger impact by becoming better </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals than they are by promoting </v>

2270
01:55:15.671 --> 01:55:15.860
<v Speaker 2>conservative doctrine.</v>

2271
01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:21.040
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though there's some utility in </v>

2272
01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:21.440
<v Speaker 2>promoting conservative doctrine on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses,</v>

2273
01:55:21.441 --> 01:55:26.441
<v Speaker 2>at least as a counterbalance to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming preponderance of radical </v>

2274
01:55:26.441 --> 01:55:27.910
<v Speaker 2>leftist thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

2275
01:55:27.911 --> 01:55:32.911
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the fundamental movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily necessary here is political </v>

2276
01:55:32.911 --> 01:55:34.310
<v Speaker 2>because I think the political is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually part of the problem.</v>

2277
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:36.920
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it looks to me.</v>

2278
01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:42.620
<v Speaker 2>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the advanced group said to send to take </v>

2279
01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 2>a hill for a healthy political discourse</v>

2280
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:46.890
<v Speaker 3>that follows us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hopefully that,</v>

2281
01:55:46.891 --> 01:55:47.490
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2282
01:55:48.010 --> 01:55:50.570
<v Speaker 3>situations turning point usa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2283
01:55:50.850 --> 01:55:55.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was shocked that charlie kirk and </v>

2284
01:55:55.850 --> 01:55:57.180
<v Speaker 3>candice owens reached out to me and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

2285
01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:59.850
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do understand who I am.</v>

2286
01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:05.780
<v Speaker 3>And I'm very confused by it because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>find that a lot of the rhetoric that </v>

2287
01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:10.551
<v Speaker 3>comes out of that absolutely unpalatable</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the private discourse is much more </v>

2288
01:56:10.981 --> 01:56:14.010
<v Speaker 3>sympathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more understanding.</v>

2289
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:19.070
<v Speaker 3>I think that the political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of that's a lack of sophistication </v>

2290
01:56:19.070 --> 01:56:22.220
<v Speaker 3>actually on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the part of the people who are doing </v>

2291
01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:24.321
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think we can move those guys </v>

2292
01:56:24.321 --> 01:56:26.121
<v Speaker 3>because just for the record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to say that when they </v>

2293
01:56:26.121 --> 01:56:26.121
<v Speaker 3>invited me to speaking gigs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>charlie said to me from day one,</v>

2294
01:56:26.121 --> 01:56:28.530
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with you on a ton of stuff,</v>

2295
01:56:28.531 --> 01:56:31.620
<v Speaker 3>but I want to invite you here to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go up there and I talk about being</v>

2296
01:56:31.621 --> 01:56:34.860
<v Speaker 3>gay married and pro choice then faculty </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of these things.</v>

2297
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:36.790
<v Speaker 3>And they give me a standing ovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2298
01:56:36.810 --> 01:56:38.120
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the problem is,</v>

2299
01:56:38.121 --> 01:56:43.121
<v Speaker 3>is that nobody can figure out why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to candace owens because when </v>

2300
01:56:43.121 --> 01:56:45.090
<v Speaker 3>she's going in red meat conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>mode,</v>

2301
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:47.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't recognize the same person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>reached out to me.</v>

2302
01:56:47.941 --> 01:56:50.040
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is the same person.</v>

2303
01:56:50.041 --> 01:56:52.320
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's a fractionation,</v>

2304
01:56:52.321 --> 01:56:57.321
<v Speaker 3>they're as interested because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>niche and the idea is that there is not </v>

2305
01:56:57.321 --> 01:56:59.490
<v Speaker 3>yet a niche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This came up with Douglas Murray.</v>

2306
01:56:59.491 --> 01:57:04.491
<v Speaker 3>It's a super important point in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are in a restrictionist mood on </v>

2307
01:57:04.491 --> 01:57:08.490
<v Speaker 3>immigration and they want more </v>
<v Speaker 3>protection is with respect to trade.</v>

2308
01:57:08.970 --> 01:57:13.970
<v Speaker 3>And the question like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take within an immigration is why </v>

2309
01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:15.300
<v Speaker 3>is it that no politician finds it easy </v>
<v Speaker 3>to exploit,</v>

2310
01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:20.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this without going completely far right </v>

2311
01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:25.010
<v Speaker 3>or completely open borders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like either it's ethno nationalism or </v>

2312
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.560
<v Speaker 3>it's all people are equal.</v>

2313
01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:27.660
<v Speaker 3>Why should we dIscriminate from people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in any other country?</v>

2314
01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:30.260
<v Speaker 3>The sensible positions are </v>
<v Speaker 3>uninhabitable.</v>

2315
01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:35.660
<v Speaker 3>So the question is why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the claim that I'm making is you </v>

2316
01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:36.780
<v Speaker 3>have to really know your stuff at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

2317
01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:40.980
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to hold a position like </v>
<v Speaker 3>we cannot be easy a phobic,</v>

2318
01:57:41.190 --> 01:57:44.010
<v Speaker 3>we have to be somewhat restrictionist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We cannot close the borders.</v>

2319
01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2320
01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I particularly want to put your finger </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

2321
01:57:46.861 --> 01:57:48.990
<v Speaker 3>You have to know your stuff to hold that</v>
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>

2322
01:57:48.991 --> 01:57:51.210
<v Speaker 3>but you shouldn't have to know it at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this level.</v>

2323
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

2324
01:57:51.901 --> 01:57:56.901
<v Speaker 3>to work I had to do to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hell happened with technical and </v>

2325
01:57:56.901 --> 01:58:00.651
<v Speaker 3>scientific immigration is a hidden study</v>
<v Speaker 3>from 1986 that nobody outside in the </v>

2326
01:58:01.561 --> 01:58:06.561
<v Speaker 3>outside world knew about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody can devote two years of their </v>

2327
01:58:06.561 --> 01:58:07.110
<v Speaker 3>life generically in order to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things out.</v>

2328
01:58:07.410 --> 01:58:11.910
<v Speaker 3>So the problem is we have to actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>take out the ground for the middle,</v>

2329
01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:17.840
<v Speaker 3>get rid of the crazies on both ends and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an idea that fundamentally,</v>

2330
01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:22.530
<v Speaker 3>or at least stopped the crazies from </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking out the reasonable people.</v>

2331
01:58:22.650 --> 01:58:25.950
<v Speaker 3>That's the issue with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't we are stopping the craziest.</v>

2332
01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:28.560
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well probably not because they're always</v>

2333
01:58:28.561 --> 01:58:33.561
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but getting their hands from around the </v>

2334
01:58:33.561 --> 01:58:33.561
<v Speaker 3>necks of the people who are sensible </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be a useful,</v>

2335
01:58:33.561 --> 01:58:38.331
<v Speaker 3>at least intermediary stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have learned painfully that I have </v>

2336
01:58:38.331 --> 01:58:40.170
<v Speaker 3>more in common with what would now be </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered center.</v>

2337
01:58:40.171 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Than do with radical</v>

2338
01:58:42.610 --> 01:58:43.180
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:47.360
<v Speaker 2>And so this idea of reaching across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aisle and saying you,</v>

2340
01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:52.420
<v Speaker 2>you take out your trash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take out my right is a very </v>

2341
01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:54.450
<v Speaker 2>important move that is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's.</v>

2342
01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:58.540
<v Speaker 2>but that's one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird about the candice own charlie kirk</v>

2343
01:58:58.541 --> 01:59:02.380
<v Speaker 2>situation is like when I went to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspen ideas festival,</v>

2344
01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:06.100
<v Speaker 2>the people who invited me there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say we're there not canonical</v>

2345
01:59:06.101 --> 01:59:11.101
<v Speaker 2>members of the commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people who are feeling </v>

2346
01:59:11.101 --> 01:59:14.131
<v Speaker 2>tremendous pressure and that's partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>why they invited me and I did get </v>

2347
01:59:14.131 --> 01:59:14.131
<v Speaker 2>invited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2348
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:16.540
<v Speaker 2>and then I discussed the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was discussing,</v>

2349
01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:19.480
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't say that I felt welcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>there at all.</v>

2350
01:59:19.630 --> 01:59:24.630
<v Speaker 2>And so one of The things that's weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>about going to talk to these </v>

2351
01:59:24.630 --> 01:59:27.091
<v Speaker 2>conservative groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I went down to dallas and I </v>

2352
01:59:27.091 --> 01:59:28.300
<v Speaker 2>talked to these women and I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't give a conservative talk.</v>

2353
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:31.390
<v Speaker 2>I gave this talk that I'm having right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2354
01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:32.980
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were,</v>

2355
01:59:33.550 --> 01:59:38.550
<v Speaker 2>they were conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time they were actually </v>

2356
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:39.640
<v Speaker 2>listening to what I was saying and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were receptive to it.</v>

2357
01:59:39.641 --> 01:59:41.890
<v Speaker 2>and so then when I go to the talk to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>leftist types,</v>

2358
01:59:41.891 --> 01:59:46.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are ideologically possessed,</v>

2359
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:48.460
<v Speaker 2>let's say in the same manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not open at all.</v>

2360
01:59:48.461 --> 01:59:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2361
01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:51.460
<v Speaker 2>but I experienced something slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

2362
01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see exactly this,</v>

2363
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:58.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm more welcoming center right circles </v>
<v Speaker 2>than I am in even center left circles </v>

2364
01:59:58.470 --> 02:00:00.400
<v Speaker 2>because of the contamination has gotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>much farther from,</v>

2365
02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:02.470
<v Speaker 2>from the extreme into the center and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

2366
02:00:03.190 --> 02:00:05.820
<v Speaker 2>But there's still this other thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2367
02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I heard the word lib,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tarred and I'm just like,</v>

2368
02:00:08.530 --> 02:00:09.910
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for christ's sake,</v>

2369
02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:11.450
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2370
02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to enslave everybody?</v>

2371
02:00:13.391 --> 02:00:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your monster.</v>

2372
02:00:14.201 --> 02:00:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Turn on you.</v>

2373
02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:15.670
<v Speaker 2>And I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2374
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 2>this is some preprogrammed set of moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2375
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:26.310
<v Speaker 2>in your comment section,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is much more of this stuff that </v>

2376
02:00:26.621 --> 02:00:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to in other people's comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something about actions or not.</v>

2377
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2378
02:00:30.710 --> 02:00:35.710
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying something about your </v>

2379
02:00:35.710 --> 02:00:35.710
<v Speaker 2>audience that somewhere in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>

2380
02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:39.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to watch the fact that there is</v>

2381
02:00:39.221 --> 02:00:43.090
<v Speaker 2>this increase in the incivility on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2382
02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:43.830
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2383
02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:47.170
<v Speaker 2>I focus my energy on the left because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my responsibility.</v>

2384
02:00:47.410 --> 02:00:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the right is my </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>

2385
02:00:50.170 --> 02:00:55.170
<v Speaker 2>but while these people are struggling </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the same prOblem you laid out at </v>

2386
02:00:55.170 --> 02:00:55.600
<v Speaker 2>the beginning though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we can,</v>

2387
02:00:55.601 --> 02:00:58.900
<v Speaker 2>we can make the case for civility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>should but,</v>

2388
02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:00.010
<v Speaker 2>but you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2389
02:01:00.011 --> 02:01:02.830
<v Speaker 2>tHe civility only goes so far until you </v>
<v Speaker 2>defend yourself.</v>

2390
02:01:02.831 --> 02:01:03.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2391
02:01:03.371 --> 02:01:06.730
<v Speaker 2>well that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like exactly how far does it go and</v>

2392
02:01:06.731 --> 02:01:09.790
<v Speaker 2>then how do you defend youRself and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're defending yourself,</v>

2393
02:01:09.791 --> 02:01:11.050
<v Speaker 2>what strategies to use.</v>

2394
02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I learned,</v>

2395
02:01:12.371 --> 02:01:15.250
<v Speaker 2>and I talked about this with dave last </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and it's something I think that we</v>

2396
02:01:15.251 --> 02:01:17.920
<v Speaker 2>should think about as members of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>loose group,</v>

2397
02:01:17.921 --> 02:01:22.921
<v Speaker 2>is that you don't defend yourself more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than is absolutely neCessary,</v>

2398
02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a minimal necessary force.</v>

2399
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:30.950
<v Speaker 2>A doctorate is the correct one and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived hard and that sort of thing could </v>

2400
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:33.490
<v Speaker 2>probably be shelved as ineffective and </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter productive.</v>

2401
02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although part of the reason that it's </v>

2402
02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:40.891
<v Speaker 2>coming up at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't an attempt to ineffective and </v>

2403
02:01:40.891 --> 02:01:42.170
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's offensive and stupid.</v>

2404
02:01:42.710 --> 02:01:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2405
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:44.690
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

2406
02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:45.880
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2407
02:01:46.110 --> 02:01:49.850
<v Speaker 2>but my point is it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually technically complicated.</v>

2408
02:01:49.851 --> 02:01:54.851
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not that easy to mount an</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective defense that isn't </v>

2409
02:01:54.851 --> 02:01:59.501
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously and attack like you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be very like I want to push you back </v>

2410
02:01:59.870 --> 02:02:02.750
<v Speaker 2>just far enough so your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no farther.</v>

2411
02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:05.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's worked out in my situation</v>

2412
02:02:05.781 --> 02:02:10.610
<v Speaker 2>so far because generally when I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>a dark publicly in the press,</v>

2413
02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:15.760
<v Speaker 2>even in interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd been able to use minimal necessary </v>

2414
02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>force and every time that's happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worked.</v>

2415
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:18.980
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommend,</v>

2416
02:02:18.981 --> 02:02:22.460
<v Speaker 2>and this would be to your listeners and </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewers and props to mind as well,</v>

2417
02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:27.580
<v Speaker 2>perhaps two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that don't push back any harder than </v>

2418
02:02:28.011 --> 02:02:31.440
<v Speaker 2>you have to write because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets rapidly do it,</v>

2419
02:02:31.441 --> 02:02:32.440
<v Speaker 2>are balanced fashion.</v>

2420
02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:35.330
<v Speaker 3>A typical thing is if somebody's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come on gang busters,</v>

2421
02:02:35.331 --> 02:02:39.370
<v Speaker 3>like you have three opportunities are so</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cut it out and they refuse to it,</v>

2422
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:40.100
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2423
02:02:40.110 --> 02:02:44.140
<v Speaker 3>I liked the rule of three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've been telling them to the curb and</v>

2424
02:02:44.141 --> 02:02:46.690
<v Speaker 3>then I offer them a hand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the question is,</v>

2425
02:02:48.190 --> 02:02:53.190
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to bite the hand up then and </v>

2426
02:02:53.190 --> 02:02:54.990
<v Speaker 3>then we have a further problem because </v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're just on some sort of </v>

2427
02:02:54.990 --> 02:02:57.511
<v Speaker 3>unbounded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the descent into hell and I'm not </v>

2428
02:02:57.511 --> 02:02:59.110
<v Speaker 3>interested in following you there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that what's really going on,</v>

2429
02:02:59.111 --> 02:03:04.111
<v Speaker 3>and this is the hardest point to make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we need to new sort of </v>

2430
02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:10.920
<v Speaker 3>hermaphroditic parties that combined </v>
<v Speaker 3>elements of right and left the don't </v>

2431
02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:15.400
<v Speaker 3>look like the terrible situation that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>inherited from the baby boomers.</v>

2432
02:03:15.401 --> 02:03:16.940
<v Speaker 3>No offense sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2433
02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:22.060
<v Speaker 3>where for a very long period of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been under one group,</v>

2434
02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:27.300
<v Speaker 3>a group set of ideas that are crashing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and burning and whatever the new thing </v>

2435
02:03:29.141 --> 02:03:32.440
<v Speaker 3>that replaces right and the new thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that replaces left is,</v>

2436
02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:35.680
<v Speaker 3>is going to have combinations of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2437
02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:38.650
<v Speaker 3>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe situation specific,</v>

2438
02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:43.680
<v Speaker 3>well differentiated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every smart person I know is pro market.</v>

2439
02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:46.450
<v Speaker 3>The key question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you believe that the market should be</v>

2440
02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:49.840
<v Speaker 3>allowed to do everything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you get these very purest things.</v>

2441
02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:54.850
<v Speaker 3>I am the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am an iron randy and I'm a guaranteed </v>

2442
02:03:54.850 --> 02:03:55.450
<v Speaker 3>free markets here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you put things in front of them</v>

2443
02:03:55.451 --> 02:03:56.230
<v Speaker 3>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2444
02:03:56.740 --> 02:04:01.740
<v Speaker 3>should physics be allowed to sign a </v>
<v Speaker 3>licensing deal where we charge you for </v>

2445
02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:03.670
<v Speaker 3>everything we've created,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the semiconductor,</v>

2446
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2447
02:04:04.901 --> 02:04:06.940
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the communications equipment that you</v>

2448
02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:12.020
<v Speaker 3>use to run your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you want to talk to me one </v>

2449
02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:14.281
<v Speaker 3>more time about tax dollars for science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to point out to you that </v>

2450
02:04:14.281 --> 02:04:16.570
<v Speaker 3>you're breaking a compact that we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you were going to support us and we</v>

2451
02:04:16.571 --> 02:04:19.630
<v Speaker 3>weren't going to charge charge you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we charge you.</v>

2452
02:04:19.630 --> 02:04:24.630
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be the ones with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>yachts and the fourth homes and you're </v>

2453
02:04:24.630 --> 02:04:26.020
<v Speaker 3>not going to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay your physics bill.</v>

2454
02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:31.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the point of this is when you welsh </v>

2455
02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:31.350
<v Speaker 3>on a contract and you start to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2456
02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:31.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2457
02:04:31.601 --> 02:04:33.340
<v Speaker 3>it's the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well guess what?</v>

2458
02:04:33.390 --> 02:04:38.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>public goods are part of markets and </v>

2459
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.390
<v Speaker 3>they're very valuable and they're hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get to pay for them.</v>

2460
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:40.470
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to use some amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>

2461
02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:43.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weber's theory is that a government is a</v>

2462
02:04:43.171 --> 02:04:45.720
<v Speaker 3>monopoly on violence and that's why it </v>
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>

2463
02:04:46.110 --> 02:04:51.110
<v Speaker 3>When you have these very pure </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological positions that are not </v>

2464
02:04:51.110 --> 02:04:52.380
<v Speaker 3>tutored by reality or deeper theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are very,</v>

2465
02:04:52.381 --> 02:04:57.381
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to dislodge people from </v>
<v Speaker 3>now because you are taking a ton of </v>

2466
02:04:57.381 --> 02:04:58.740
<v Speaker 3>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a smaLl business owner,</v>

2467
02:04:59.390 --> 02:05:04.390
<v Speaker 3>you are going to be predisposed towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>and libertarian mindset because you're </v>

2468
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:06.240
<v Speaker 3>not only making money from your hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2469
02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:09.270
<v Speaker 3>You're making money from the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking on huge amounts of risk.</v>

2470
02:05:09.570 --> 02:05:13.770
<v Speaker 3>And when people don't identify risk </v>
<v Speaker 3>management as a source of inequality,</v>

2471
02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:15.930
<v Speaker 3>we've got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

2472
02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:18.270
<v Speaker 3>there are a ton of people I know in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York.</v>

2473
02:05:18.271 --> 02:05:21.270
<v Speaker 3>We're making money hand over fist by </v>
<v Speaker 3>extracting it through rent,</v>

2474
02:05:21.271 --> 02:05:26.271
<v Speaker 3>seeking by putting themselves as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>toll collector so that everybody's got </v>

2475
02:05:26.271 --> 02:05:29.841
<v Speaker 3>to do business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to pay them off in some sort of </v>

2476
02:05:29.841 --> 02:05:29.841
<v Speaker 3>legalized form of corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those people.</v>

2477
02:05:29.841 --> 02:05:34.341
<v Speaker 3>I fundamentally think we should have </v>
<v Speaker 3>clawed back their property on long </v>

2478
02:05:34.341 --> 02:05:34.980
<v Speaker 3>island and come up with clawback </v>
<v Speaker 3>national seashore.</v>

2479
02:05:35.370 --> 02:05:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we bailed them out in the great </v>

2480
02:05:40.370 --> 02:05:43.910
<v Speaker 3>recession and collapse in 2008 now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe we'll get lucky and you know,</v>

2481
02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:49.480
<v Speaker 3>and I'm thinking that the possibilities </v>
<v Speaker 3>that these increasingly long form,</v>

2482
02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:55.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities for communication and the </v>

2483
02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:57.831
<v Speaker 3>rise of podcasts and the rise of audio </v>
<v Speaker 3>books and all of that is going to </v>

2484
02:05:57.831 --> 02:06:01.791
<v Speaker 3>produce a more educated and committed </v>
<v Speaker 3>electorate and they will be </v>

2485
02:06:01.791 --> 02:06:06.380
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated enough to start to sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>out these problems without recourse to </v>

2486
02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:10.161
<v Speaker 3>these ideological or with last recourse </v>
<v Speaker 3>to these ideological overseas still </v>

2487
02:06:10.161 --> 02:06:10.350
<v Speaker 3>fighting Jordan.</v>

2488
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:12.120
<v Speaker 3>They're still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still not coming.</v>

2489
02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:17.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean the number of people I know who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are privately aware of me and publicly </v>

2490
02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:20.340
<v Speaker 3>show no awareness of what I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2491
02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:23.040
<v Speaker 3>A actually the same thing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2492
02:06:23.041 --> 02:06:26.670
<v Speaker 3>it's a running joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tilting fast was much more for you.</v>

2493
02:06:26.671 --> 02:06:31.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean because I think by breaking it </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to get there first and you broke </v>

2494
02:06:31.831 --> 02:06:36.831
<v Speaker 3>through with the book and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing a different thing than </v>

2495
02:06:36.831 --> 02:06:40.700
<v Speaker 3>anybody else in this network is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point would be that they had to </v>

2496
02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:41.790
<v Speaker 3>contend with you because they had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mystery,</v>

2497
02:06:41.791 --> 02:06:44.840
<v Speaker 3>which is why is there a number one </v>
<v Speaker 3>bestseller,</v>

2498
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:47.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by somebody who's,</v>

2499
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:49.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we explain any amount of this,</v>

2500
02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:51.430
<v Speaker 3>dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just that I come to weddings,</v>

2501
02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:53.640
<v Speaker 3>availed my angry young white men </v>
<v Speaker 3>followers,</v>

2502
02:06:53.641 --> 02:06:55.580
<v Speaker 3>but those aren't the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>buying funny.</v>

2503
02:06:55.740 --> 02:07:00.740
<v Speaker 3>And I started taking pictures with all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the people of color and the talks are</v>

2504
02:07:02.041 --> 02:07:06.240
<v Speaker 3>up to about 40 percent women now and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>age at least at least the age.</v>

2505
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:10.380
<v Speaker 3>The one thing I do see though is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of men come alone,</v>

2506
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:13.830
<v Speaker 3>but very few women come alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's about 40 percent</v>

2507
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:18.870
<v Speaker 1>women now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you about the group of </v>

2508
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.870
<v Speaker 1>grandmothers that I met about a week or </v>
<v Speaker 1>two ago.</v>

2509
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I forget what city it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was this group of grandmothers</v>

2510
02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:25.560
<v Speaker 1>they get together and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was about nine or 10 of them and </v>

2511
02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:29.101
<v Speaker 1>all in their sixties and seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they all love you and it draws in </v>

2512
02:07:29.101 --> 02:07:29.290
<v Speaker 1>september.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2513
02:07:29.291 --> 02:07:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll get all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

2514
02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:32.940
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

2515
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:35.100
<v Speaker 3>one kid came up to me and one of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>talks and I said,</v>

2516
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:40.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started talking about how important </v>

2517
02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:40.470
<v Speaker 3>it was that you were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2518
02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:40.630
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this done for your life?</v>

2519
02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:42.520
<v Speaker 3>This is what has it done for my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2520
02:07:42.521 --> 02:07:43.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2521
02:07:43.001 --> 02:07:45.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at home smoking weed,</v>

2522
02:07:45.461 --> 02:07:48.100
<v Speaker 3>masturbating too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing video games,</v>

2523
02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:49.690
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2524
02:07:49.810 --> 02:07:53.410
<v Speaker 3>six months later I've got a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fiance,</v>

2525
02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:55.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2526
02:07:55.501 --> 02:07:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I think he had some gal who was not </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in because of his situation,</v>

2527
02:07:59.231 --> 02:08:01.150
<v Speaker 3>but liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he turned his life around.</v>

2528
02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:06.780
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is partly what's so incredibly fun </v>

2529
02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:09.820
<v Speaker 3>about these events is that people just </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell that story over and over.</v>

2530
02:08:09.821 --> 02:08:12.850
<v Speaker 3>It's so fun because they come up to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>

2531
02:08:12.851 --> 02:08:17.851
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's six months ago I was having all </v>

2532
02:08:17.851 --> 02:08:17.851
<v Speaker 3>these troubles and sometimes it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious.</v>

2533
02:08:17.851 --> 02:08:20.050
<v Speaker 3>I was suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what was really effective,</v>

2534
02:08:20.060 --> 02:08:25.060
<v Speaker 3>what really affected me about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation was nothing about this guy </v>

2535
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:26.050
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loser.</v>

2536
02:08:26.650 --> 02:08:31.650
<v Speaker 3>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it told me is that some of the </v>

2537
02:08:31.650 --> 02:08:35.320
<v Speaker 3>difficulties we've had in our markets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly after post 2008,</v>

2538
02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:41.160
<v Speaker 3>there was this thing that worked less </v>
<v Speaker 3>and less well over time and people who </v>

2539
02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:43.120
<v Speaker 3>were college educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were hard working,</v>

2540
02:08:43.150 --> 02:08:48.150
<v Speaker 3>who were creative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're still living at home with their </v>

2541
02:08:48.150 --> 02:08:49.510
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's an added kick.</v>

2542
02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:50.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2543
02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:55.560
<v Speaker 3>when do you hit the nitrous oxide in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to get the car to zoom into </v>

2544
02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:55.690
<v Speaker 3>hyperspace?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2545
02:08:56.410 --> 02:08:57.280
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2546
02:08:57.281 --> 02:08:58.660
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before I ever met you,</v>

2547
02:08:58.661 --> 02:09:01.210
<v Speaker 3>I had this shtick about the world uncle </v>
<v Speaker 3>shortage,</v>

2548
02:09:01.450 --> 02:09:06.450
<v Speaker 3>that fundamentally we needed a class of </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncles and also aunts who aren't exactly</v>

2549
02:09:07.061 --> 02:09:11.830
<v Speaker 3>parents to put a cigar in your mouth in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a single malt and in your hand and say,</v>

2550
02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:14.130
<v Speaker 3>listen kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how the world actually works.</v>

2551
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:16.450
<v Speaker 3>Get the hell out there and master it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2552
02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:17.050
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

2553
02:09:17.110 --> 02:09:19.340
<v Speaker 3>don't you bucko me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the key issue is,</v>

2554
02:09:19.341 --> 02:09:24.341
<v Speaker 3>is that I think you became the one man </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer to the world uncle shortage.</v>

2555
02:09:25.330 --> 02:09:29.470
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's important at some point</v>
<v Speaker 3>to deepen the offering because there are</v>

2556
02:09:29.471 --> 02:09:31.600
<v Speaker 3>many different kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fundamentally,</v>

2557
02:09:31.601 --> 02:09:36.601
<v Speaker 3>I need to not focus on cleaning my room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have because I'm a messy room guy and </v>

2558
02:09:36.601 --> 02:09:40.960
<v Speaker 3>I need to get my physics out and I need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do certain sorts of things to get my </v>

2559
02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:42.730
<v Speaker 3>life in order that are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing anything.</v>

2560
02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.930
<v Speaker 3>You could start by cleaning your room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2561
02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:45.160
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2562
02:09:45.161 --> 02:09:46.540
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad advice.</v>

2563
02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:47.200
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2564
02:09:47.201 --> 02:09:49.960
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the case that we need </v>
<v Speaker 3>sane,</v>

2565
02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:55.080
<v Speaker 3>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funky ants because there's a lot of bad </v>

2566
02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:59.431
<v Speaker 3>advice being given to women and oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this radical stuff on the left </v>

2567
02:09:59.471 --> 02:10:02.350
<v Speaker 3>isn't going to be sorted out by matt if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be sorted out.</v>

2568
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:07.350
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be sorted out by sensible </v>
<v Speaker 3>women who put it into it and I'm hoping </v>

2569
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:08.560
<v Speaker 3>that will happen and just a sensible </v>
<v Speaker 3>women that I,</v>

2570
02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:11.410
<v Speaker 3>that I've talked to who would like to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are terrified,</v>

2571
02:10:11.411 --> 02:10:12.550
<v Speaker 3>terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shredded by.</v>

2572
02:10:12.551 --> 02:10:13.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad you sent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2573
02:10:13.811 --> 02:10:15.970
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear that over and over,</v>

2574
02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:19.150
<v Speaker 3>and these are often women who are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions of substantial power.</v>

2575
02:10:19.151 --> 02:10:22.200
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't think that they would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified of this,</v>

2576
02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:22.900
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2577
02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:25.420
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what one of these women who will</v>

2578
02:10:25.421 --> 02:10:27.160
<v Speaker 3>remain nameless said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

2579
02:10:27.670 --> 02:10:31.360
<v Speaker 3>I've never been afraid of men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

2580
02:10:31.361 --> 02:10:32.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you afraid of?</v>

2581
02:10:32.530 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 3>And we worked through it a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she said,</v>

2582
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'm afraid of is weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

2583
02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2584
02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:41.720
<v Speaker 1>What an interesting observation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>

2585
02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong people can say that comment was a</v>

2586
02:10:45.591 --> 02:10:46.530
<v Speaker 1>little sour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2587
02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:47.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2588
02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:53.320
<v Speaker 1>what did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because very often how many boneheaded </v>

2589
02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:55.060
<v Speaker 1>comments I make boneheaded comments you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make if you,</v>

2590
02:10:55.061 --> 02:10:58.670
<v Speaker 1>if people don't have a chance to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>with ideas and to come back from it,</v>

2591
02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:00.890
<v Speaker 1>if the answer to everything is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancel,</v>

2592
02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:02.900
<v Speaker 1>well then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's no hope.</v>

2593
02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Well then you're not in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also just not inviting people to </v>

2594
02:11:07.930 --> 02:11:10.331
<v Speaker 1>play with the ideas that actually they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't play with them and never be stupid</v>

2595
02:11:10.791 --> 02:11:13.130
<v Speaker 1>in their initial formulations of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

2596
02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Then they don't get it on the nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on that note,</v>

2597
02:11:16.551 --> 02:11:21.551
<v Speaker 1>I want to take my two uncles out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch and then we will bring in my </v>

2598
02:11:21.621 --> 02:11:23.540
<v Speaker 1>cousin ben shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that sound?</v>

2599
02:11:23.541 --> 02:11:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sound good?</v>

2600
02:11:24.651 --> 02:11:29.651
<v Speaker 1>All right guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to do the second live </v>

2601
02:11:29.651 --> 02:11:29.651
<v Speaker 1>stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2602
