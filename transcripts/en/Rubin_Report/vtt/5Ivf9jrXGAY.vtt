<v Speaker 1>We're live on location at Stanford </v>
<v Speaker 1>University and joining me today is an </v>

2
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>economist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>author,</v>

3
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:10.644
<v Speaker 1>scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>senior fellow at the Hoover Institution </v>

4
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>and living legend Dr Thomas Soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

6
00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:18.004
<v Speaker 1>Good to be with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel I have to get the gushing out </v>

7
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way we can focus on the book.</v>

8
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:22.884
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that there is anyone on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this mortal coil who's writing and </v>

9
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>thinking has influenced me more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

10
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is truly an honor for me and I just</v>

11
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>have to get that out right at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I just hope I have ms dot Lazar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll find out.</v>

13
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you know at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>so first I thought I wanted to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit on your history and I want to</v>

15
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:46.011
<v Speaker 1>focus on your new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was curious if you have a sense of</v>

16
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:47.094
<v Speaker 1>the sort of renaissance that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing is having right now with young </v>

17
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>people because when I tweeted out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we finally had you on the show and we've</v>

18
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>been trying to make this happen for </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite some time.</v>

19
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of responses and I had tons of</v>

20
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>people just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please tell him this,</v>

21
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 1>tell him this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My awakening was because of Dr.</v>

22
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>how all of this are you noticing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something happening right now because of</v>

23
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:08.784
<v Speaker 1>the unique place where I only know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people tell me that's even true at </v>

24
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I only know what my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my research assistants told me.</v>

26
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'll certainly accept that.</v>

27
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.414
<v Speaker 1>Will take my word for it than a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to talk a little bit about </v>

28
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>your history for a bit and then we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll move on to your new book.</v>

29
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.843
<v Speaker 1>A born North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grew up in the bronx to Harlem in </v>

30
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.131
<v Speaker 1>Harlem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

31
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>in Harlem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>tell me a little bit about some of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>formative years.</v>

33
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.913
<v Speaker 1>I thought about is I was doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>research for the first chapter where I </v>

35
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>get into birth order thing now had my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.520
<v Speaker 1>my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>loot a normal lifespan.</v>

38
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I would have been the sixth trial in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

39
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>They died young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was adopted in infancy,</v>

40
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.523
<v Speaker 1>a family as an only child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised as an only child in a home with </v>

41
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:03.564
<v Speaker 1>four adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of what I found in the </v>

42
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>other researcher on birth order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly that was a huge advantage,</v>

43
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until their misfortune was my good </v>

44
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Moreover,</v>

45
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>the family in which I was raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to New York,</v>

46
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>which at that time had a far superior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>educational system for that in North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolina and foster period of what it is</v>

48
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you always interested in education?</v>

49
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even as got to kill it,</v>

50
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.043
<v Speaker 1>a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing in my background that </v>

51
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 1>would put me there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

52
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.213
<v Speaker 1>but fortunately when in Harlem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a kid named ready that the </v>

53
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.153
<v Speaker 1>members of the family had run into </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I ever arrived from North </v>

54
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Carolina.</v>

55
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came from a highly educated family,</v>

56
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they immediately saw the </v>

57
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>implications if they could get him to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of mentor me.</v>

59
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And now I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had met Eddie on my own chances.</v>

60
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I would never have seen any </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

61
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the people I pass by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course the,</v>

62
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.033
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adults understood what the future </v>

63
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:13.264
<v Speaker 1>was like and then thinking about things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kids don't think about despite the </v>

64
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>great worship of a child talkers these </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

65
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

66
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took me to a public library and I had</v>

67
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:27.754
<v Speaker 1>no idea what a public library was when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was eight years old and I saw all these </v>

68
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:32.854
<v Speaker 1>books and I had no idea why we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>there when I didn't have any money to </v>

69
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:35.704
<v Speaker 1>buy one book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what am I going to do with all </v>

70
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>these hundreds of books out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf?</v>

71
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>And he very patiently walked me through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

72
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.593
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very reluctant to take out a </v>

73
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 1>library card because I didn't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what all this is about that.</v>

74
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.163
<v Speaker 1>But he talked me into it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I bought a couple of books and </v>

75
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:55.804
<v Speaker 1>really had I not encountered him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire rest of the story could not </v>

76
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>have been the way it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

77
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>at some point I would have learned what </v>
<v Speaker 1>a public library was,</v>

78
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.190
<v Speaker 1>but by that point it would be too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

80
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>when you start getting in the habit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading when you're eight years old,</v>

81
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.753
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a different ballgame than if you </v>

82
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>had to wait till you're a teenager and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too late now.</v>

83
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.683
<v Speaker 1>Dare I ask if you have any recollection </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you might've taken out of the </v>

84
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>library at eight years old?</v>

85
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the books was adopted.</v>

86
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Do little books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

87
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you even know what those</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

88
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 1>He could talk to the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alice in wonderland and uh,</v>

89
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>the rest of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

90
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came in on May and there wasn't.</v>

91
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.143
<v Speaker 1>School wasn't open until September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had no one to play with and I was </v>

92
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:40.444
<v Speaker 1>just bored to tears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I started reading really for the </v>

93
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 1>first time and I got the habit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading and on that,</v>

94
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that made the rest possible.</v>

95
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were there any other formative things </v>

96
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>that happened to you over those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those younger years?</v>

97
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same fellow.</v>

98
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>It was a very knowledgeable about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>school system,</v>

99
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 1>so when I finished elementary school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they assigned me to a junior high school</v>

100
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:06.320
<v Speaker 1>in a very bad neighborhood and he told </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that you,</v>

101
00:05:06.321 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>you can get transferred.</v>

102
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 1>And I in fact got transferred to a much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better school.</v>

103
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gone to that other school.</v>

104
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I again,</v>

105
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 1>the story would have been entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

106
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

107
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.513
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the themes or the early part of </v>

108
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:20.794
<v Speaker 1>the book here is that there are a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of things you have to come </v>

109
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>together and if you don't have all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those prerequisites,</v>

110
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>then whatever good qualities you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't matter.</v>

111
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And I mentioned illiteracy that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:34.504
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 40 percent of the adults </v>

113
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>in the world was still illiterate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't matter what the native</v>

114
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.020
<v Speaker 1>talent or any of that came along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't read there a whole lot of,</v>

115
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation.</v>

116
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>You just simply can't get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

117
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty clear from all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading of yours that I've done,</v>

118
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>you put basic education basically is </v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

119
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

120
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the one thing that you can do as</v>

121
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:01.380
<v Speaker 1>a human being?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get educated,</v>

122
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.873
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I wouldn't carry it too far </v>

123
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.603
<v Speaker 1>because some of the most disastrous </v>
<v Speaker 1>notions in the world who come from </v>

124
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.700
<v Speaker 1>highly educated people with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure high Iq.</v>

125
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.780
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps critical thinking with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little education.</v>

126
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will settle for almost any kind of.</v>

127
00:06:19.651 --> 00:06:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare these days.</v>

128
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It is oddly rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

129
00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:24.934
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I found out that </v>

130
00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:29.740
<v Speaker 1>was sort of amazing about your history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you briefly mentioned it right before we</v>

131
00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:30.574
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a Marxist at one time in your </v>

132
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:33.844
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people will find this hard to </v>

133
00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.580
<v Speaker 1>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is true,</v>

134
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

135
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.740
<v Speaker 1>most of the leading conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers of our time,</v>

136
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not start off as conservative.</v>

137
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>You've got a couple of like a Bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buckley and George will,</v>

138
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.950
<v Speaker 1>but I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman was,</v>

139
00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:53.080
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a liberal and a Keynesian.</v>

140
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.503
<v Speaker 1>A High Eq was a socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan was so far left at one </v>

141
00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:01.720
<v Speaker 1>point the FBI was following him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.841
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

143
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:03.674
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

144
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge movement from the left to</v>

145
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 1>the right as people get older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm well aware,</v>

147
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned to you earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a former progressive,</v>

148
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movement in the modern sense.</v>

149
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember sort of what you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking?</v>

150
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>What appealed to you at that time about </v>
<v Speaker 1>artism?</v>

151
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

152
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.440
<v Speaker 1>there was no alternative being </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>

153
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first job was as a Western Union </v>

154
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Messenger and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would come home on some nights.</v>

155
00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I would take the fifth avenue bus which </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost all of fifteen cents in those days,</v>

156
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.300
<v Speaker 1>but I figured I splurge now and then and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would drive,</v>

157
00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:40.134
<v Speaker 1>it would go all the way up fifth avenue </v>
<v Speaker 1>past always Lord and Taylor and all </v>

158
00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:48.801
<v Speaker 1>these fancy places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then cross 57th street past Carnegie</v>

159
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Hall and down Riverside Drive.</v>

160
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And that was sort of the Gold Coast </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

161
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 1>And then yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came across this long viaduct and that</v>

162
00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.493
<v Speaker 1>turned into 135th street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly there were the tenements and I </v>

163
00:08:02.491 --> 00:08:04.980
<v Speaker 1>went into why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

164
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.211
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

165
00:08:06.211 --> 00:08:11.211
<v Speaker 1>it's so different and nothing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools or most of the books,</v>

166
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to deal with that and walks,</v>

167
00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:15.480
<v Speaker 1>dealt with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

168
00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:16.290
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

169
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like winning an election when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only one person running.</v>

170
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.813
<v Speaker 1>So then what was your wake up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was wrong with that line of </v>

171
00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 1>thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A facts?</v>

172
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:25.283
<v Speaker 1>Facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could probably end the interview </v>

173
00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:30.400
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Specifically.</v>

174
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.700
<v Speaker 1>My first professional job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a,</v>

175
00:08:32.701 --> 00:08:33.534
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a summer intern at the US Department of </v>

176
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.403
<v Speaker 1>Labor and I realized from dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that the US Department of </v>

177
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.833
<v Speaker 1>Labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of my biggest concern was about </v>

178
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.810
<v Speaker 1>minimum wages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been for a long time.</v>

179
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.810
<v Speaker 1>And so my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my.</v>

180
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.003
<v Speaker 1>At first I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is good because all these </v>

181
00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:53.330
<v Speaker 1>people are poor and it'll get a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher income and so that,</v>

182
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>that'll be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

183
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I studied economics,</v>

184
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I began to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's the downside.</v>

185
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 1>They may lose their jobs completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as that.</v>

186
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 1>And so I try and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was at the Labor Department,</v>

187
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.544
<v Speaker 1>I tried to talk about that to them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually I came up with some test of </v>

188
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 1>it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

189
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>when I came up with this test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we might test this,</v>

190
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.353
<v Speaker 1>I was waiting to hear congratulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that it had this and I can see </v>

191
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:18.804
<v Speaker 1>these people were stunned as oldest </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot has stumbled on something that </v>

192
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>will ruin us all.</v>

193
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.800
<v Speaker 1>And I realized the US Department of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Labor had its own agenda and interests.</v>

194
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.903
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that didn't necessarily not </v>

195
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:32.874
<v Speaker 1>necessarily mean that the were the four </v>
<v Speaker 1>people lost their jobs for minimum wage </v>

196
00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>and it got higher pay was their highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>

197
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:40.314
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much longer did you last after that </v>

198
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Speaker 1>was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

199
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.313
<v Speaker 1>that was really the turning point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I began to see that all these </v>

200
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:46.554
<v Speaker 1>government agencies were not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their own institutional </v>

201
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.913
<v Speaker 1>incentives and you cannot say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government will step in and do what's </v>

202
00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:54.534
<v Speaker 1>right for these people and whatnot </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'll do what's right for </v>

203
00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think a lot of people watching this</v>

204
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 1>and I know because I've been so open </v>
<v Speaker 1>about my own sort of awakening,</v>

205
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.013
<v Speaker 1>are going through this right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're realizing that the things that </v>

206
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 1>they've been taught for so long are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth and are not based.</v>

207
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:11.843
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that happened to you and you </v>

208
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:13.944
<v Speaker 1>started telling other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the people you were working </v>

209
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be it family or friends,</v>

210
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.413
<v Speaker 1>what kind of pushback did you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was sort of radical ideas in </v>

211
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>a way that you were talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

212
00:10:22.411 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

213
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:25.180
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel any need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.311
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a lot,</v>

215
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:27.930
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of proselytizing.</v>

216
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was enough for me that,</v>

217
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:31.554
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was now beginning to understand </v>

218
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:35.470
<v Speaker 1>things I hadn't understood before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

219
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.323
<v Speaker 1>you noted that in the book I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned minimum wage studies and </v>

220
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 1>really they are incredibly flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole chapter on numbers,</v>

221
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

222
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.430
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing,</v>

223
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.210
<v Speaker 1>getting back to my personal development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

224
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I left home when I was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

225
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 1>no high school diploma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no skills,</v>

226
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.740
<v Speaker 1>no job experience.</v>

227
00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.913
<v Speaker 1>And I discovered that there was not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of demand for people like </v>

228
00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:03.900
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

229
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.780
<v Speaker 1>but in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades later when I do research,</v>

230
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:07.614
<v Speaker 1>I realized that in 1948,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unemployment rate for black 16 and </v>

231
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:17.910
<v Speaker 1>17 year olds was nine point four for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whites,</v>

232
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia was 10 point two,</v>

233
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>and those numbers are much smaller than </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were used to in recent decades.</v>

234
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.943
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no serious racial </v>

235
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

236
00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:31.950
<v Speaker 1>the blocks in my age bracket we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>just slightly better.</v>

237
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>

238
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:34.494
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that the minimum wage </v>
<v Speaker 1>law does is that it creates </v>

239
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.060
<v Speaker 1>unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised it to multiples of what it was.</v>

240
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.283
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 48 was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a special time because the </v>

241
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:46.914
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage law was passed in 1938.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the intervening 10 years there </v>

242
00:11:50.571 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 1>was huge inflation in the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't gotten.</v>

243
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.220
<v Speaker 1>And so for all practical purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no minimum wage law.</v>

244
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.750
<v Speaker 1>But had we had these wonderful liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

245
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 1>insisting that I be paid a living wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were supportive.</v>

246
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Family of four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been unemployed.</v>

247
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.713
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that would've looked </v>

248
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.543
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't probably would not have led </v>

249
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.270
<v Speaker 1>up to everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

250
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.133
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about these wonderful </v>

251
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 1>liberals as you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I think there's sort of two lines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

253
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:20.350
<v Speaker 1>One is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.390
<v Speaker 1>the road to hell is paved with good </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions.</v>

255
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 1>I try not to a highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a super highway.</v>

256
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try not to besmirch their intentions,</v>

257
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>but then I think there are people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are either can have confused thinking or</v>

258
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:32.554
<v Speaker 1>have ulterior motives or what else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it is as someone that </v>

259
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:37.270
<v Speaker 1>is so based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

260
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.340
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to get to a plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fact in a moment.</v>

261
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.710
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the thinking is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flaw in that thinking?</v>

262
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.193
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the idea that you don't </v>

263
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>have to check a good sounding idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>against what actually happens.</v>

264
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole 90 zero people to this day who</v>

265
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 1>thinks that the 19 sixties was just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great period and a,</v>

266
00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.213
<v Speaker 1>and I'll send them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you realize how many good trends </v>

267
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.350
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

268
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.500
<v Speaker 1>the murder rate among black males had </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone down,</v>

269
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.910
<v Speaker 1>it had been going down for two decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:16.060
<v Speaker 1>by 18 percent in one decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 percent in the next decade,</v>

271
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 1>and in 1960 is suddenly it takes a uturn</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight up and that was not peculiar to</v>

272
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:25.240
<v Speaker 1>blocks or even to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pinker's book about,</v>

273
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.020
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

274
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.520
<v Speaker 1>violence that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:32.521
<v Speaker 1>that throughout what the Western world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the homicide rates did a uturn in the 19</v>

276
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:38.080
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is what actually happens</v>

277
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:39.970
<v Speaker 1>when you put your wonderful ideas to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>

278
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.043
<v Speaker 1>Do they produce the kind of thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they were going to produce or </v>

279
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:43.594
<v Speaker 1>the produce all the opposite and many </v>
<v Speaker 1>errors and they produce lots of </v>

280
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 1>opposites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

281
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:47.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you mentioned Steven pinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had him on the show a few weeks ago </v>

282
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 1>and I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the clearest thinkers we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have and you know,</v>

284
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:57.220
<v Speaker 1>his new book enlightened me now is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are trending more positively,</v>

285
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.670
<v Speaker 1>but even hearing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very hard for a lot of people.</v>

286
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what your baseline is,</v>

287
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.240
<v Speaker 1>a pancreas much more optimistic than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>am.</v>

288
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

289
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:09.543
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I happen to be very pessimistic about </v>

290
00:14:10.571 --> 00:14:13.040
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hope the optimists are right.</v>

291
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you're a pessimist by </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature?</v>

292
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.603
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think having studied with so many </v>

293
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.260
<v Speaker 1>things that sounded so good and ended up</v>
<v Speaker 1>so bad,</v>

294
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me a doubt,</v>

295
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.043
<v Speaker 1>especially when there are people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious to spout off with very little </v>

296
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.080
<v Speaker 1>study of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what they're talking about.</v>

297
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a lot of that these days.</v>

298
00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that has ramped up or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

299
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I think social media seems to amplify </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

300
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:41.914
<v Speaker 1>but do you think it's always been that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way about just sort of this endless </v>

301
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 1>pontificating of people that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what they're talking about?</v>

302
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.153
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always been that as long as </v>

303
00:14:48.771 --> 00:14:49.604
<v Speaker 1>there have been human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the question is magnitude of it and </v>

304
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 1>the ability of various institutions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut out on any other viewpoint of which</v>

305
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.500
<v Speaker 1>the universities are the worst examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

306
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.491
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

307
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

308
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:05.150
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see the riots with Charles Murray</v>

309
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.660
<v Speaker 1>shows up and I have a notion I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>blurry.</v>

310
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.523
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can demonize wherever you can </v>

311
00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:11.430
<v Speaker 1>demonize anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

312
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

313
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to see what are they going to</v>

314
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:15.794
<v Speaker 1>quote that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard a single quote of all </v>

315
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:19.430
<v Speaker 1>the books the man is written.</v>

316
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.110
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never caught anything he said.</v>

317
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of what he said is the direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of what they claim.</v>

318
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:28.150
<v Speaker 1>He said that tells you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about state we're in right now.</v>

319
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>

320
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.793
<v Speaker 1>this thing that's happening on college </v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses right now that everyone seems </v>

321
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>to think it's freezing free speech and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to be speeches,</v>

322
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 1>speech that's generally thought of as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

323
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians,</v>

324
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.673
<v Speaker 1>further people on the right than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that's really not a new </v>

325
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:46.461
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

326
00:15:46.461 --> 00:15:48.110
<v Speaker 1>you were kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

327
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.180
<v Speaker 1>it was not that bad in the 19 fifties </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a Marxist.</v>

328
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:57.220
<v Speaker 1>And when Senator Joe McCarthy was Kara </v>
<v Speaker 1>was tracking down anybody on the left.</v>

329
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:59.203
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said whatever I felt like where I </v>

330
00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:01.734
<v Speaker 1>arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like it and I got no such blow </v>

331
00:16:03.521 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>

332
00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:06.770
<v Speaker 1>So McCarthy's talking about all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

333
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:10.010
<v Speaker 1>but you had no problem being an open in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>

334
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I was in Cambridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so be it.</v>

335
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do think of something has gotten </v>

336
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:15.800
<v Speaker 1>worse now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

337
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.130
<v Speaker 1>there was a number of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venereal diseases,</v>

338
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going down a very steep worried it</v>

339
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:23.504
<v Speaker 1>was either syphilis or gonorrhea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one half or as prevalent in 1960 as </v>

340
00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:29.074
<v Speaker 1>it was in 1950.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That brilliant idea was to bring in sex </v>

341
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:33.710
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

342
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:38.711
<v Speaker 1>to avoid unwanted pregnancies and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a venereal diseases skyrocketed.</v>

343
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Unwanted pregnancies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenage pregnancy skyrocketed.</v>

344
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.523
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that so many people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left are able to just ignore any facts </v>

345
00:16:49.941 --> 00:16:51.800
<v Speaker 1>that go against their theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

346
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:53.750
<v Speaker 1>it just does not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

347
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:55.543
<v Speaker 1>my uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my old mentor at the University of </v>

348
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a joy stigler argued however,</v>

349
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:04.180
<v Speaker 1>that economists have early influence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they,</v>

350
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.810
<v Speaker 1>what they say makes very little </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

351
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.350
<v Speaker 1>And he was giving a talk at the hoover </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution wants.</v>

352
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.213
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to years of dedicated work by </v>

353
00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

354
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.573
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next minimum wage increase will be </v>

355
00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:18.290
<v Speaker 1>five cents an hour less than it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been otherwise.</v>

356
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:20.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's interesting to me is </v>

357
00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:22.520
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I,</v>

358
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:23.354
<v Speaker 1>as I prefaced this with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the writings that you've </v>

359
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:27.104
<v Speaker 1>done all these years and these books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're becoming culturally relevant </v>

360
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:32.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe in a way that they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to say it this way,</v>

361
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:35.300
<v Speaker 1>but maybe in a way that they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't economically relevant.</v>

362
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.153
<v Speaker 1>Why do you understand the point there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think there's a cultural </v>

363
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:39.554
<v Speaker 1>relevance to all the things that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done for these last 40 some odd years </v>

364
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.300
<v Speaker 1>that seems so actually powerful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>impactful to me right now,</v>

365
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.343
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible when it comes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact that that's a different story </v>

366
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 1>entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

367
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.133
<v Speaker 1>long ago I stopped accepting invitations</v>
<v Speaker 1>to testify before a congressional </v>

368
00:17:59.010 --> 00:17:59.760
<v Speaker 1>committees.</v>

369
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.593
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolute waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have made up their minds and they </v>

370
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:04.254
<v Speaker 1>just want to be able to say they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard all points of view and then it </v>

371
00:18:07.701 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 1>pretty much stops there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

372
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember once or Kenneth Clark was,</v>

373
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I was debating him and he was beside </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself because of the mindset,</v>

374
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.243
<v Speaker 1>supposed sinister influence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington during the Reagan </v>

375
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told him if my,</v>

376
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.480
<v Speaker 1>if my influence in Washington is all you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to worry about,</v>

377
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.320
<v Speaker 1>very fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad because I've had,</v>

378
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.333
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of anything that happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>any different than if I had never said </v>

379
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:36.540
<v Speaker 1>anything to anybody that you're being </v>
<v Speaker 1>very humble sir.</v>

380
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm realistic.</v>

381
00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:38.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

382
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't find it.</v>

383
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I can remember testifying before one </v>
<v Speaker 1>committee and uh,</v>

384
00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.173
<v Speaker 1>the audience was so rowdy that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chairman had to bang the gavel to keep </v>

385
00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:51.430
<v Speaker 1>them shut.</v>

386
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:56.430
<v Speaker 1>The shut them down and they put some </v>
<v Speaker 1>little tiny thing in the law.</v>

387
00:18:57.091 --> 00:19:00.270
<v Speaker 1>They were building a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would bet their rent money that,</v>

388
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:04.670
<v Speaker 1>that provision is gone now because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so many people who did,</v>

389
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 1>who didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

390
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help up for kids,</v>

391
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 1>then give the money to the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it.</v>

392
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:12.450
<v Speaker 1>For where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where were they go.</v>

393
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.553
<v Speaker 1>Don't turn it over to the institution </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they will then use it in an </v>

394
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:17.304
<v Speaker 1>entirely different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there any examples where the money </v>

395
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:22.890
<v Speaker 1>is turned over to the institution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the institution might be,</v>

396
00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:25.590
<v Speaker 1>where it really does work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there any aberrations?</v>

397
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.713
<v Speaker 1>There must.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There must be somewhere by the law of </v>

398
00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:30.660
<v Speaker 1>averages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a is not prevalent.</v>

399
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a couple of times you've mentioned </v>

400
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:33.654
<v Speaker 1>liberals and one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about on my show offing because I </v>

401
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:37.770
<v Speaker 1>wa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a progressive.</v>

402
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a lefty.</v>

403
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.373
<v Speaker 1>I now call myself a classical liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've tried to make the point that </v>

404
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:46.530
<v Speaker 1>being a liberal in the traditional sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>has very little,</v>

405
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:49.770
<v Speaker 1>if anything to do with the left anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

406
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.693
<v Speaker 1>Are there any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you see any sort of meaningful </v>

407
00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:57.360
<v Speaker 1>distinction between classical liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Libertarian at this point or,</v>

408
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.520
<v Speaker 1>or DC even?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask you a couple things at once and</v>

409
00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:01.100
<v Speaker 1>you can go any direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

410
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.310
<v Speaker 1>do you see any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there,</v>

411
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Speaker 1>do you see a difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course between liberals and the left.</v>

412
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean the words have all sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>

413
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.910
<v Speaker 1>When I used to always say that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a liberal Senator Hyatt,</v>

414
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.043
<v Speaker 1>and of course in different countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word means different things in </v>

415
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

416
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>if you said you were a liberal that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would understand what you saying,</v>

417
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.573
<v Speaker 1>but in a liberal and is Australia is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from a liberal in the United </v>

418
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.000
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

419
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.700
<v Speaker 1>So when you say liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean leftist basic.</v>

420
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.930
<v Speaker 1>The American sense of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

421
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think there's any sort of </v>

422
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.273
<v Speaker 1>real distinction that needs to be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>between classical liberal and </v>

423
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:35.184
<v Speaker 1>libertarian that that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people ask me all the time </v>

424
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.120
<v Speaker 1>and I know you're not big on labels </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally,</v>

425
00:20:39.121 --> 00:20:43.770
<v Speaker 1>but I did read something where you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the closest thing that you could be</v>

426
00:20:43.771 --> 00:20:44.604
<v Speaker 1>labeled as his libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that still where you're at accept a </v>

427
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 1>course in foreign policy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about that too.</v>

428
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:52.703
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess also the Libertarians seem to </v>

429
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:56.704
<v Speaker 1>have this atomistic view of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a completely </v>

430
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:03.120
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

431
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's a good because not only in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

432
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:10.160
<v Speaker 1>but in the lives of people around me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

433
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.490
<v Speaker 1>the surroundings might make a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

434
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.863
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I get into a lot in </v>

435
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.803
<v Speaker 1>the book is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disparities imply either either </v>

436
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.440
<v Speaker 1>discrimination on the one hand or </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic differences on the other.</v>

437
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.430
<v Speaker 1>And disparities are the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

438
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading something the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

439
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:30.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

440
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:31.744
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America has eight percent of the </v>

441
00:21:33.701 --> 00:21:34.534
<v Speaker 1>people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They commit 38 percent of all the </v>

442
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:40.960
<v Speaker 1>murders and in Latin America at 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

443
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.670
<v Speaker 1>no 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>38 percent for that.</v>

444
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:43.803
<v Speaker 1>But in Latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of the murders occur on two </v>

445
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:47.650
<v Speaker 1>percent of the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

446
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you find that when you look,</v>

447
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.823
<v Speaker 1>look up facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you find over and over </v>

448
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:54.050
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

449
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.263
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in all the discussions of a income </v>

450
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.200
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they acted that day.</v>

451
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.780
<v Speaker 1>They never take into account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Age and age is huge.</v>

452
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:05.614
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese Americans have a median age of </v>

453
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:11.680
<v Speaker 1>50 Hispanic Americans has immediate age </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 26.</v>

454
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.233
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see a Hispanic Americans </v>

455
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:21.150
<v Speaker 1>greatly overrepresented among baseball </v>
<v Speaker 1>stars and not a single Japanese American</v>

456
00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:24.640
<v Speaker 1>baseball star and the major leagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in the entire history.</v>

457
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had each hero on.</v>

458
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:27.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

459
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

460
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.403
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people of Japanese ancestry </v>

461
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 1>who've come baseball stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them are from Japan.</v>

462
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.030
<v Speaker 1>None of them are Japanese American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

463
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:37.721
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

464
00:22:37.721 --> 00:22:39.190
<v Speaker 1>He played,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a star in Japan for that.</v>

465
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

466
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:41.081
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

467
00:22:41.081 --> 00:22:43.840
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how many 50 year old men are going to</v>

468
00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:46.020
<v Speaker 1>be baseball stars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

469
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.120
<v Speaker 1>and by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many 20,</v>

470
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.700
<v Speaker 1>26 year old men are going to be surgeons</v>
<v Speaker 1>or ceos,</v>

471
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other kind of job that requires long</v>

472
00:22:54.191 --> 00:22:57.640
<v Speaker 1>years of study or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and slash or long years of experience.</v>

473
00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.773
<v Speaker 1>And so even if they were the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two groups were the same in every </v>

474
00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:03.064
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there was absolutely no </v>

475
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 1>distinction though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination and whatnot,</v>

476
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.870
<v Speaker 1>they still would be a huge difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>income simply because of age.</v>

477
00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.330
<v Speaker 1>And that really is what this book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

478
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book itself,</v>

479
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:16.990
<v Speaker 1>it's about 160 pages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I loved,</v>

480
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many pages of notes you have in </v>

481
00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:19.240
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have,</v>

482
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.170
<v Speaker 1>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off hand veins,</v>

483
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.770
<v Speaker 1>127 bay pages are texts and the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as notes.</v>

484
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:24.843
<v Speaker 1>So you had about 30 some odd pages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>notes and I actually started going </v>

485
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>through the notes because I thought this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

486
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 1>this is exactly what we need now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

487
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was reading it,</v>

488
00:23:33.641 --> 00:23:34.474
<v Speaker 1>there were pages that I had to read more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than once because you're obviously </v>

489
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:37.114
<v Speaker 1>giving a lot of numbers and facts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at these things from </v>

490
00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:42.970
<v Speaker 1>different angles and we're not very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that these days.</v>

491
00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:43.491
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

492
00:23:43.491 --> 00:23:44.324
<v Speaker 1>we're sort of from one angle and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you start the screaming and I think </v>

493
00:23:47.781 --> 00:23:49.820
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really a master up here.</v>

494
00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you.</v>

495
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to but we'll see.</v>

496
00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:54.920
<v Speaker 1>We'll see how it works out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

497
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.843
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you make any meaningful distinction </v>

498
00:23:56.961 --> 00:23:59.150
<v Speaker 1>between sort of a classical liberal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a libertarian?</v>

499
00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that just sort of a,</v>

500
00:24:01.111 --> 00:24:04.940
<v Speaker 1>that's a wholly peripheral as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

501
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to get a few simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts that crosses a full time job.</v>

502
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

503
00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:11.900
<v Speaker 1>So now let's talk about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts that you learned in the back.</v>

504
00:24:11.901 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 1>You talk about two types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination.</v>

505
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you,</v>

506
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 1>could you lay those out in the world has</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost opposite meetings.</v>

507
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:19.773
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first meeting when they say </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have someone has discriminating </v>

508
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:22.920
<v Speaker 1>tastes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean he,</v>

509
00:24:22.921 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 1>he can tell what is a good wine from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad wine,</v>

510
00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:29.660
<v Speaker 1>what is a good camera from a bedroom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>

511
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.913
<v Speaker 1>And that's almost the exact opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meeting and the law where you mean </v>

512
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:36.074
<v Speaker 1>someone who judges someone by what group</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes from irrespective of the </v>

513
00:24:40.491 --> 00:24:43.250
<v Speaker 1>individual's actual personal qualities.</v>

514
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 1>So those are two very different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

515
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 1>ideally you would like every person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be judged as an individual,</v>

516
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:52.483
<v Speaker 1>but as a practical matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes impossible because the </v>

517
00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:56.700
<v Speaker 1>costs are prohibitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

518
00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I use the example where if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking down the street at night and you</v>

519
00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:04.130
<v Speaker 1>see a shadowy figure in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an alley up ahead,</v>

520
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.203
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you judge him as an individual or do </v>

521
00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:10.490
<v Speaker 1>you cross the street and go across on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side because,</v>

522
00:25:10.491 --> 00:25:11.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost of,</v>

523
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.680
<v Speaker 1>of judging him as an individual can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>very high including your life.</v>

524
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

525
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:18.703
<v Speaker 1>so we make that distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I say that I call that </v>

526
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:24.580
<v Speaker 1>discrimination discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One one is when you just have a,</v>

527
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.433
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very good understanding of what the </v>

528
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:27.614
<v Speaker 1>facts are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you judge these persons and </v>

529
00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:30.064
<v Speaker 1>individually I call that discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 1>one a and then if you judge them by the </v>

530
00:25:33.441 --> 00:25:35.270
<v Speaker 1>group they belong to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not as good,</v>

531
00:25:35.271 --> 00:25:38.690
<v Speaker 1>but that's discrimination wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still based on some facts,</v>

532
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination tool,</v>

533
00:25:40.181 --> 00:25:41.014
<v Speaker 1>which is one reason we have anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination laws is that you don't </v>

534
00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:45.260
<v Speaker 1>worry about that at all.</v>

535
00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 1>And he's someone that you don't like for</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason.</v>

536
00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>

537
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

538
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.770
<v Speaker 1>you're biased against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

539
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Are you shocked when you look at what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on right now?</v>

540
00:25:56.391 --> 00:25:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And see so much talk about race all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

541
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:02.630
<v Speaker 1>So much talk about all of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that separate us,</v>

542
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.673
<v Speaker 1>the very things that you've been arguing</v>
<v Speaker 1>against based in fact for so many years </v>

543
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:08.804
<v Speaker 1>that seemed in an odd way more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's more racism now </v>

544
00:26:12.051 --> 00:26:15.260
<v Speaker 1>than ever or more of dividers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's more talk about it.</v>

545
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's devastating.</v>

546
00:26:17.631 --> 00:26:22.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean a was in general a much easier to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start than they ought to stop.</v>

547
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

548
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that a fellow in,</v>

549
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:27.734
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

550
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Speaker 1>in Serbia shot the archduke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

551
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.920
<v Speaker 1>who knew that that was going to millions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people around the world,</v>

552
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 1>including people from the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to about 10,000</v>

553
00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:41.840
<v Speaker 1>miles away and I called with and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting the great war and you can't get</v>

554
00:26:41.841 --> 00:26:41.960
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

555
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.060
<v Speaker 1>You get an a and worried about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current trade war.</v>

556
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.480
<v Speaker 1>You start a trade war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may never be able to stop it.</v>

557
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:49.314
<v Speaker 1>And then in the next decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are too many people </v>

558
00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many cross currents of interests and</v>

559
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:55.000
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

560
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.030
<v Speaker 1>what would you do about our school </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems?</v>

561
00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try,</v>

562
00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to be rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do try.</v>

563
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.790
<v Speaker 1>They are so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

564
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.033
<v Speaker 1>the public has no idea what I'm reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>a book about the schools and the woman </v>

565
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:12.534
<v Speaker 1>who writing a Diane Ravitch is talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how teachers have due process </v>

566
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.600
<v Speaker 1>before they can be fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now know when you look into the facts of</v>

567
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.120
<v Speaker 1>it right down here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was afternoon the,</v>

568
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.790
<v Speaker 1>it cost a half a million dollars to fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>one incompetent teacher,</v>

569
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:31.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

571
00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a big enough budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

572
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.710
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has something called the rubber room.</v>

573
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.543
<v Speaker 1>This is the teachers who is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>incompetent that the principals don't </v>

574
00:27:40.981 --> 00:27:42.890
<v Speaker 1>want them in the classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:48.650
<v Speaker 1>and they get paid full salary and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>show up and they accrue a pension rights</v>

576
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.173
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last time I forget how many </v>

577
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:54.894
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars I spent a year in </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York paying for teachers who don't </v>

578
00:27:59.101 --> 00:27:59.934
<v Speaker 1>teach and in fact don't do anything but </v>
<v Speaker 1>show up at at the same time as if they </v>

579
00:28:03.121 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 1>were teaching and they read magazines or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

580
00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:09.680
<v Speaker 1>They feel like doing a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this forest goes on a,</v>

581
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.553
<v Speaker 1>at a time when they don't have enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to provide the kids with a decent </v>

582
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 1>supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we scale back this?</v>

583
00:28:16.441 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can talk,</v>

584
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.840
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about it through the lens of</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

585
00:28:18.841 --> 00:28:19.674
<v Speaker 1>but in any mna area where the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>has taken on a bigger role than it's </v>

586
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:23.934
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things you hear all </v>

587
00:28:24.571 --> 00:28:26.070
<v Speaker 1>the time is it's sort of too late.</v>

588
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people think it's too </v>
<v Speaker 1>late to take back.</v>

589
00:28:28.651 --> 00:28:30.600
<v Speaker 1>No government power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

590
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.440
<v Speaker 1>you heaven's a during the Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>

591
00:28:34.441 --> 00:28:39.441
<v Speaker 1>That was the only time I know of when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Federal Register grew.</v>

592
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:40.374
<v Speaker 1>Smaller that where they compile all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws that had been passed in a given </v>

593
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it can be done.</v>

594
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:47.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

595
00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.770
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

596
00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can be done.</v>

597
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:53.483
<v Speaker 1>Someone wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some issue with Reagan was </v>

598
00:28:55.711 --> 00:28:56.990
<v Speaker 1>discussing and someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it,</v>

599
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.920
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

600
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 1>not complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not easy to do.</v>

601
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now we,</v>

602
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

603
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.093
<v Speaker 1>one of the big forces out here or talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about affordable housing and they're </v>

604
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.203
<v Speaker 1>appointing a blue ribbon committee is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look into why there's no affordable </v>

605
00:29:13.981 --> 00:29:14.814
<v Speaker 1>housing and I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like appointing of Blue Ribbon </v>

606
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Committee to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

607
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.700
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to explain why the ground is wet after,</v>

608
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.690
<v Speaker 1>after a rain.</v>

609
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:22.853
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you prevent people from building </v>

610
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:26.754
<v Speaker 1>housing and the population is growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a housing shortage </v>

611
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.880
<v Speaker 1>and you won't have affordable housing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

612
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics one during the first,</v>

613
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.023
<v Speaker 1>first two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not very good at taking </v>

614
00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:39.980
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>widow and I don't think so.</v>

615
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.913
<v Speaker 1>So when you're answering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in almost every case to just scale </v>

616
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:46.520
<v Speaker 1>back government scale back regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what they're doing there.</v>

617
00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:47.810
<v Speaker 1>There were some things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

618
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.110
<v Speaker 1>the government is necessary to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

619
00:29:50.111 --> 00:29:52.660
<v Speaker 1>what are those types of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>done for security?</v>

620
00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:54.490
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>

621
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:58.800
<v Speaker 1>having dependable laws up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that if you're a,</v>

622
00:29:59.040 --> 00:29:59.873
<v Speaker 1>a for free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you don't think the </v>

623
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:03.320
<v Speaker 1>government should do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

624
00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:08.110
<v Speaker 1>you get the free markets don't operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>except within a framework of laws that's</v>

625
00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:08.944
<v Speaker 1>wholly different from having them </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate with politicians jumping in </v>

626
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:17.610
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable times to suddenly pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>some new legislation.</v>

627
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do right now?</v>

628
00:30:19.961 --> 00:30:20.794
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so really this would be about just sort </v>

629
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:25.750
<v Speaker 1>of electing more libertarian minded </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians then.</v>

630
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.733
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that really the only way we can </v>

631
00:30:27.401 --> 00:30:28.234
<v Speaker 1>change things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>

632
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.103
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the main thing people have to </v>

633
00:30:29.771 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 1>know what the facts are themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

634
00:30:32.171 --> 00:30:33.004
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everyone knew what all the facts </v>

635
00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:34.894
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd have an Italian different </v>

636
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.670
<v Speaker 1>set of set of people elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

637
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that either of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential candidates in 19 in 2016,</v>

638
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:44.781
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

639
00:30:44.781 --> 00:30:45.614
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been the candidates if you </v>

640
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:49.360
<v Speaker 1>had an informed public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not very good at that.</v>

641
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.910
<v Speaker 1>How much of this do you think is part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media's fault?</v>

642
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.560
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things was the media </v>
<v Speaker 1>are mostly uninformed.</v>

643
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

644
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.050
<v Speaker 1>They're not uninformed or misinformed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

645
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:00.983
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

646
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.610
<v Speaker 1>and they simply do not shut.</v>

647
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Check the facts on the large issues of </v>
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>

648
00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:09.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

649
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.350
<v Speaker 1>what can we do to fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>

650
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose this,</v>

651
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I buy books like this as well,</v>

652
00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:16.924
<v Speaker 1>but I think more fundamentally the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public that votes has to itself become </v>

653
00:31:20.641 --> 00:31:21.474
<v Speaker 1>informed and not be so easily stampeded </v>
<v Speaker 1>by slogans in a few numbers thrown </v>

654
00:31:25.871 --> 00:31:27.480
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

655
00:31:27.481 --> 00:31:28.314
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women make x percent of what men make </v>

656
00:31:30.521 --> 00:31:31.660
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

657
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.693
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started studying that some years </v>

658
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.553
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

659
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out that a young,</v>

660
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.913
<v Speaker 1>young female doctors made much less </v>
<v Speaker 1>money than young male doctors not seem </v>

661
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 1>like a very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I.</v>

662
00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:46.984
<v Speaker 1>But when you're looking into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you discover that young male doctors </v>

663
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:50.584
<v Speaker 1>work an average of 500 hours a year or </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than young female doctors and they </v>

664
00:31:54.431 --> 00:31:57.180
<v Speaker 1>get paid for the 500 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

665
00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.083
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason why the women and men </v>

666
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:01.050
<v Speaker 1>should be doing the same thing.</v>

667
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.903
<v Speaker 1>Their circumstances are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are there any laws that are in place </v>

668
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:05.794
<v Speaker 1>right now that you believe are </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminatory one way or another </v>

669
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:10.534
<v Speaker 1>toward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards any community or against any </v>

670
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:14.410
<v Speaker 1>community?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to write a much larger book</v>

671
00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:19.150
<v Speaker 1>to cover them all the minimum wage laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely devastating,</v>

672
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:20.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the policy of saying that you cannot </v>

673
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.823
<v Speaker 1>have more kids from one ethnic group </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined in the school and from </v>

674
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:28.534
<v Speaker 1>another is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean groups are different for each </v>

675
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:33.964
<v Speaker 1>other and umpteen ways and then just </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the presumption that they are the </v>

676
00:32:38.171 --> 00:32:42.200
<v Speaker 1>same except the way they're treated a is</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

677
00:32:42.201 --> 00:32:43.034
<v Speaker 1>It's never been true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know why we would think is </v>

678
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:47.600
<v Speaker 1>true here today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do sense that some of what you just</v>

679
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:48.434
<v Speaker 1>said there is bubbling up into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>national conscience because I get a ton </v>

680
00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:53.900
<v Speaker 1>of email from black conservatives now.</v>

681
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.460
<v Speaker 1>People that feel that they haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented fairly or that the,</v>

682
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

683
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.940
<v Speaker 1>the so called leaders of the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>community that are on television all the</v>

684
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:02.774
<v Speaker 1>time are actually preaching the complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse of everything that you've said </v>

685
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:07.304
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you sense that there is some sort of </v>

686
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.010
<v Speaker 1>growing conservative movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black community?</v>

687
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.870
<v Speaker 1>There was a time when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

688
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.733
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that community with a consistent of </v>

689
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:18.780
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walter Williams,</v>

690
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.173
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know all these to say we were the </v>

691
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:26.490
<v Speaker 1>tuition of a fly on the same plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise a whole will disappear.</v>

692
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes down.</v>

693
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned to you before we started </v>

694
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:31.274
<v Speaker 1>that Larry elder caused my awakening </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was a progressive and I said </v>

695
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:35.834
<v Speaker 1>something to him about a systemic racism</v>
<v Speaker 1>on air and he beat me senseless with </v>

696
00:33:41.091 --> 00:33:45.380
<v Speaker 1>facts and I had to go back and reassess </v>
<v Speaker 1>what was wrong with my thinking.</v>

697
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:45.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

698
00:33:45.741 --> 00:33:46.480
<v Speaker 1>in one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of the,</v>

699
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.510
<v Speaker 1>in one of the chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

700
00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I have a little section about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

701
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the era of apartheid in South Africa.</v>

702
00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.150
<v Speaker 1>And I had that in there because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much argument.</v>

703
00:33:56.151 --> 00:33:56.984
<v Speaker 1>How much racism is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soap when I say let's test this </v>

704
00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:02.640
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis in a setting where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no doubt is a,</v>

705
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.650
<v Speaker 1>a Raga and that's apartheid in South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

706
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:07.733
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the government where blacks were </v>

707
00:34:08.541 --> 00:34:10.040
<v Speaker 1>not allowed to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>

708
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.053
<v Speaker 1>And you then apply the economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles and you find that the </v>

709
00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:15.880
<v Speaker 1>economic principles apply in South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa that,</v>

710
00:34:15.881 --> 00:34:17.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some occupations.</v>

711
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.883
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blacks weren't allowed by law to be in </v>

712
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:23.450
<v Speaker 1>certain occupations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more than a certain percentage and in</v>

713
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:24.284
<v Speaker 1>some occupations couldn't be hired at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all in some of those occupations where </v>

714
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:30.740
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't be hired at all illegal to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hire them at all.</v>

715
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:31.723
<v Speaker 1>There were more blacks higher than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whites because there are economic </v>

716
00:34:34.431 --> 00:34:35.264
<v Speaker 1>factors that could come in and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pass a law and not automatically </v>

717
00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:39.890
<v Speaker 1>produces the results you want.</v>

718
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>

719
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.770
<v Speaker 1>can you go into some of the economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors that you mentioned there?</v>

720
00:34:42.771 --> 00:34:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Because I thought it was sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the types of jobs that</v>

721
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I had and why that would affect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

722
00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.350
<v Speaker 1>it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the competitiveness of the industry</v>

723
00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:55.480
<v Speaker 1>and the competitive industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A discrimination and then the,</v>

724
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:58.940
<v Speaker 1>in the sense that we use for entity </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination laws,</v>

725
00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.023
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it costs the discriminator as well as </v>

726
00:35:01.311 --> 00:35:02.144
<v Speaker 1>the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in so far as the price can be </v>

727
00:35:05.091 --> 00:35:06.770
<v Speaker 1>invaded by the discriminated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will,</v>

728
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:07.940
<v Speaker 1>he will describe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

729
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.390
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage laws let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a minimum wage law,</v>

730
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:13.123
<v Speaker 1>you have more people applying for jobs </v>
<v Speaker 1>in those categories than there are jobs </v>

731
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.140
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the raising,</v>

732
00:35:20.141 --> 00:35:20.974
<v Speaker 1>the raising the wage rate cause more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to apply and employers to hire </v>

733
00:35:24.411 --> 00:35:27.860
<v Speaker 1>fewer because if more expensive and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a chronic surplus.</v>

734
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Now if you've got a chronic surplus in </v>
<v Speaker 1>an industry,</v>

735
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:34.780
<v Speaker 1>it costs nothing to discriminate but it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and but it.</v>

736
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.623
<v Speaker 1>But if you have a competitive market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course it does cost something </v>

737
00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:42.130
<v Speaker 1>that for every person that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate against those qualified,</v>

738
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:42.973
<v Speaker 1>you've got to hire somebody else and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to raise that paved cap rate in </v>

739
00:35:45.871 --> 00:35:50.070
<v Speaker 1>order to get people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I show how how competitive industries</v>

740
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:54.450
<v Speaker 1>have much less discrimination than say a</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulated public utilities.</v>

741
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering when I was reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were ever going to talk about how</v>

742
00:35:57.631 --> 00:35:58.464
<v Speaker 1>now technology is also changing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we see a lot of these movements for </v>

743
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:05.610
<v Speaker 1>$15 minimum wage and I know why you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think that's a great idea,</v>

744
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.653
<v Speaker 1>but even now where we see Mcdonald's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these other places just </v>

745
00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:12.760
<v Speaker 1>replacing people with IBS and computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

746
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.740
<v Speaker 1>this has been happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

747
00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.690
<v Speaker 1>when I grew up in Harlem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you went into a movie theater,</v>

748
00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.770
<v Speaker 1>this is a little neighborhood movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater in Harlem.</v>

749
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.023
<v Speaker 1>There would be a kid who would walk by </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the aisle with you with a </v>

750
00:36:24.231 --> 00:36:28.340
<v Speaker 1>flashlight and show you to your seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now,</v>

751
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.453
<v Speaker 1>now that we have so many compassionate </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who want people to be paid a </v>

752
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.840
<v Speaker 1>living wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually stumbled down this down the</v>

753
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:37.763
<v Speaker 1>aisle to your seat the best way you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not going to pay that </v>

754
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:41.860
<v Speaker 1>kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

755
00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.053
<v Speaker 1>the that's unrelated to productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say to the people I hear </v>

756
00:36:46.731 --> 00:36:48.200
<v Speaker 1>a growing movement of people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

757
00:36:48.201 --> 00:36:49.034
<v Speaker 1>this is why we need a universal basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>income because technology is going to </v>

758
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:57.080
<v Speaker 1>force for so many people out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace.</v>

759
00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.293
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has,</v>

760
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.263
<v Speaker 1>that is that the island has been made </v>
<v Speaker 1>for centuries and has been proven wrong </v>

761
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:04.730
<v Speaker 1>for centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

762
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I would ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has happened?</v>

763
00:37:08.341 --> 00:37:09.930
<v Speaker 1>We've moved in that direction already.</v>

764
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.063
<v Speaker 1>We have lots of people who can live off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the welfare state and not and not and </v>

765
00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:17.480
<v Speaker 1>not have to be productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

766
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.013
<v Speaker 1>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are they better people as a result </v>

767
00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:22.530
<v Speaker 1>of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

768
00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.870
<v Speaker 1>one of I saw some time back and have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't follow this,</v>

769
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.003
<v Speaker 1>that a young pete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suicide rates among young people </v>

770
00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:32.040
<v Speaker 1>were among the negative consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties,</v>

771
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

772
00:37:34.391 --> 00:37:34.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

773
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.780
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've taken all meaning out of people's</v>

774
00:37:36.781 --> 00:37:37.614
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they find all kinds of crazy </v>

775
00:37:40.051 --> 00:37:42.450
<v Speaker 1>things to do drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

776
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

777
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:47.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not peculiar to the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you find this in Britain,</v>

778
00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:49.090
<v Speaker 1>other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

779
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:53.160
<v Speaker 1>and so again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who say this almost never look at</v>

780
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:56.940
<v Speaker 1>any facts about what's happened as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded the welfare state,</v>

781
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.340
<v Speaker 1>that people behave better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

782
00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

783
00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:02.340
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when one of the,</v>

784
00:38:02.341 --> 00:38:07.341
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that one was that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember very well when I was,</v>

785
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.823
<v Speaker 1>I was back in the school in Harlem for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason maybe doing research and I </v>

786
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:14.490
<v Speaker 1>looked out the window and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

787
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a teenager,</v>

788
00:38:15.901 --> 00:38:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I used to walk a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dog in that park.</v>

789
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.380
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it look so hard.</v>

790
00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I came up with the students' faces </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that was,</v>

791
00:38:23.271 --> 00:38:26.040
<v Speaker 1>that was a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

792
00:38:26.041 --> 00:38:27.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

793
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.983
<v Speaker 1>and when I tell them that I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep out on the fire escape on hot </v>

794
00:38:30.151 --> 00:38:30.984
<v Speaker 1>summer nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who,</v>

795
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.960
<v Speaker 1>who could afford air conditioning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think I'm a man from Mars.</v>

796
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 1>People did that all over New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did it in Washington.</v>

797
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:39.634
<v Speaker 1>They did it in North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relatives in Washington used to go down </v>

798
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:45.573
<v Speaker 1>and Haynes point down here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jefferson memorial on hot summer </v>

799
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:51.780
<v Speaker 1>nights and sleep there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometime after midnight when,</v>

800
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.653
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the heat wouldn't be so bad and </v>

801
00:38:53.821 --> 00:38:54.654
<v Speaker 1>he'd go home at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be out of your mind to do that </v>

802
00:38:58.301 --> 00:39:00.080
<v Speaker 1>today would be too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

803
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.203
<v Speaker 1>So how do we sort of untie some of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my sister right now lives on the </v>

804
00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:05.764
<v Speaker 1>upper west side in Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too far from Harlem and she's in a </v>

805
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.250
<v Speaker 1>half a rent stabilized or rent </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled building and,</v>

806
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:13.630
<v Speaker 1>and half market price.</v>

807
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:14.463
<v Speaker 1>She's on the market price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's paying to be in a bedroom in </v>

808
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:17.704
<v Speaker 1>New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to tell you how </v>

809
00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:21.430
<v Speaker 1>expensive it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there are basically half of the</v>

810
00:39:21.431 --> 00:39:22.264
<v Speaker 1>building that's paying next to nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that of course incentivizes people </v>

811
00:39:25.781 --> 00:39:26.614
<v Speaker 1>not to get off the Dole because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're living in a nice area on the </v>

812
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:31.630
<v Speaker 1>upper west side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cheap.</v>

813
00:39:31.631 --> 00:39:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Why in the world would you ever get off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dole?</v>

814
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.820
<v Speaker 1>How do we start solving these problems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know,</v>

815
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I know facts is your is your bedrock ans</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

816
00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.553
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what can we do to get people to </v>

817
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:43.910
<v Speaker 1>understand some of this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's easy.</v>

818
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:48.160
<v Speaker 1>It seems so basic to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone was giving you something that</v>

819
00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:51.370
<v Speaker 1>you didn't earn this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this again is,</v>

820
00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:55.470
<v Speaker 1>this is common in Europe and England </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially is a,</v>

821
00:39:55.471 --> 00:39:56.304
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a special problem because you have </v>

822
00:39:58.961 --> 00:39:59.794
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this place where your rent is </v>

823
00:40:01.511 --> 00:40:06.511
<v Speaker 1>subsidized and say you're in London and </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs are disappearing in London and they</v>

824
00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 1>opening up in Manchester.</v>

825
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to Manchester,</v>

826
00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:10.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

827
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 1>you get on a waiting list for that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

828
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

829
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:16.270
<v Speaker 1>as you stay in London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're unemployed,</v>

830
00:40:16.271 --> 00:40:18.420
<v Speaker 1>which rent is low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so pete,</v>

831
00:40:18.421 --> 00:40:20.770
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you slow down the movement of people,</v>

832
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:23.590
<v Speaker 1>you slow down the turnover of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these apartments.</v>

833
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:24.723
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people who talk about this don't </v>

834
00:40:26.201 --> 00:40:29.890
<v Speaker 1>even talk in terms of if this then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk about it is,</v>

835
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:32.350
<v Speaker 1>this is how the world ought to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

836
00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:34.490
<v Speaker 1>heck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think of all kinds of things we'll</v>

837
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.040
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the world ought to be.</v>

838
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately most of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>involve a cost trade off.</v>

839
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there is a system or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>government that's doing it better,</v>

840
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.100
<v Speaker 1>doing freedom better than we're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>here for,</v>

841
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 1>for all the flaws that we have in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this system?</v>

842
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Is anyone doing it better than us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although there may be marginally solved,</v>

843
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.920
<v Speaker 1>but I think most of the Western world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>less free than it was,</v>

844
00:40:59.921 --> 00:41:03.190
<v Speaker 1>say 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years ago by,</v>

845
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.000
<v Speaker 1>by what measurements do you view that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

846
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.270
<v Speaker 1>just the amount of regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

847
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.180
<v Speaker 1>things you could use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also by consequences.</v>

848
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:14.343
<v Speaker 1>I was reading a Milton Friedman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and his wife had a joint </v>

849
00:41:16.661 --> 00:41:20.680
<v Speaker 1>autobiography and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's looking at one point,</v>

850
00:41:20.681 --> 00:41:21.514
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking back on the days when she would </v>

851
00:41:24.521 --> 00:41:28.930
<v Speaker 1>ride the ind subway in Manhattan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a joy it was.</v>

852
00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:32.560
<v Speaker 1>And she said it knows long gone days and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

853
00:41:32.561 --> 00:41:33.394
<v Speaker 1>the ind subway goes through Harlem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman and his wife when they </v>

854
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:41.180
<v Speaker 1>were still according used to go dancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the savoy ballroom.</v>

855
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.190
<v Speaker 1>A very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people want.</v>

856
00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.820
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the famous theme song of Duke Ellington,</v>

857
00:41:49.821 --> 00:41:51.200
<v Speaker 1>take the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a train the,</v>

858
00:41:51.201 --> 00:41:54.080
<v Speaker 1>a train goes right through Harlem on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and D line.</v>

859
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Friedman who was only five foot two,</v>

860
00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:01.870
<v Speaker 1>he had no fear of being mugged or even a</v>
<v Speaker 1>costume.</v>

861
00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.440
<v Speaker 1>And go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were.</v>

862
00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.140
<v Speaker 1>And this was common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

863
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.983
<v Speaker 1>there was a black actress who used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get finished with Pele and her </v>

864
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.730
<v Speaker 1>socializing afterwards at 1:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

865
00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:14.564
<v Speaker 1>She said she would be taking the subway </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to 155th street and St Nicholas </v>

866
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Avenue by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one walking home,</v>

867
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:22.243
<v Speaker 1>nobody does that these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to look one at what are </v>

868
00:42:26.241 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 1>the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they change?</v>

869
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

870
00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:34.010
<v Speaker 1>and he don't simply say the other thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the same,</v>

871
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.520
<v Speaker 1>the no child left behind thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>

872
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.750
<v Speaker 1>There are kids who go to school to raise</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

873
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And a handful of those can present the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole classroom learning anything.</v>

874
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Now the logical thing would be to </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate those kids out.</v>

875
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.480
<v Speaker 1>And the ones who want to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

876
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.373
<v Speaker 1>learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that because the ideology </v>

877
00:42:56.271 --> 00:42:58.240
<v Speaker 1>says no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

878
00:42:58.241 --> 00:42:59.074
<v Speaker 1>so and so you sacrifice whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations of poor and minority kids </v>

879
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.770
<v Speaker 1>for this ideology and this utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion.</v>

880
00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we.</v>

881
00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:09.560
<v Speaker 1>And we ended up in an ID,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dystopia.</v>

882
00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Probably Friedman used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

883
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:12.943
<v Speaker 1>the best is the enemy of the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it would be better if </v>

884
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:19.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody could be educated at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

885
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:20.383
<v Speaker 1>It can't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as someone that has survived the </v>

886
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.250
<v Speaker 1>arrows and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the venom that the left can throw at</v>

887
00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:30.200
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I see a lot of this these days.</v>

888
00:43:30.201 --> 00:43:32.270
<v Speaker 1>I see even when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say to me,</v>

889
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.433
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find I get a lot of email from people </v>

890
00:43:35.241 --> 00:43:35.640
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

891
00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.730
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I be brave enough to do it?</v>

892
00:43:37.731 --> 00:43:42.731
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's particularly a unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation for a minorities that consider</v>

893
00:43:43.731 --> 00:43:46.430
<v Speaker 1>themselves conservative or libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a little bit to the right.</v>

894
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:47.503
<v Speaker 1>So I mentioned Larry elder before and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course you and my friend David Webb and </v>

895
00:43:50.481 --> 00:43:50.811
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

896
00:43:50.811 --> 00:43:51.644
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some more black conservatives </v>

897
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:54.790
<v Speaker 1>than perhaps there used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

898
00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:55.683
<v Speaker 1>no question about what would be if </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's watching this right now and </v>

899
00:43:58.251 --> 00:44:02.090
<v Speaker 1>just needs that little extra bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>courage to start saying,</v>

900
00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:02.541
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

901
00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:03.374
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

902
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.670
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at the circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

903
00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I've advised some young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

904
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.393
<v Speaker 1>do not go into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up teaching in public schools </v>

905
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.180
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

906
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:15.103
<v Speaker 1>the odds are so stacked against you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can write bad references from </v>

907
00:44:18.531 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For you,</v>

908
00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:22.210
<v Speaker 1>when you touch him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're young and you,</v>

909
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:25.580
<v Speaker 1>and what they say about you is all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this someone sees now,</v>

910
00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 1>by the time I was a teaching at some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these schools,</v>

911
00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I remember one place where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>department,</v>

912
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:34.210
<v Speaker 1>she haven't used to threaten one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues who,</v>

913
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.030
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't write good rob references </v>
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>

914
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

915
00:44:37.651 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

916
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.560
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd published stuff while I was still in</v>

917
00:44:40.561 --> 00:44:43.140
<v Speaker 1>graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had Milton Friedman and enjoy joy,</v>

918
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.983
<v Speaker 1>stealing the right references for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this guy said there as chairman of </v>

919
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:49.320
<v Speaker 1>the department wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't matter a bit,</v>

920
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.530
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people don't have,</v>

921
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:52.800
<v Speaker 1>don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

922
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.070
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to pick you,</v>

923
00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.170
<v Speaker 1>you have to pick your fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to,</v>

924
00:44:59.171 --> 00:45:00.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time is limited here.</v>

925
00:45:00.641 --> 00:45:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I want to mention one thing that you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at the end of the book that really</v>

926
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:07.840
<v Speaker 1>what we need more than anything else </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps is common decency.</v>

927
00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 1>And we've Kinda lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't common anymore.</v>

928
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

929
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 1>when I was going to school and we'd have</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights on the school yard grounds,</v>

930
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.493
<v Speaker 1>when one guy was clearly a beaten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever was the toughest kids in the </v>

931
00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:26.370
<v Speaker 1>crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which simply step in and stop it.</v>

932
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.080
<v Speaker 1>The other guys said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to fight,</v>

933
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you can fight me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

934
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:32.850
<v Speaker 1>that's what we needed in the public </v>
<v Speaker 1>square.</v>

935
00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

936
00:45:34.411 --> 00:45:35.360
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

937
00:45:35.361 --> 00:45:36.194
<v Speaker 1>but what I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only so much the police can do </v>

938
00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:40.083
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have common decency that </v>

939
00:45:41.581 --> 00:45:43.470
<v Speaker 1>the cops are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

940
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:45.210
<v Speaker 1>not going to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to handle it,</v>

941
00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:48.090
<v Speaker 1>especially in when everyone is second </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

942
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I love it when people who have never </v>
<v Speaker 1>fired a gun on their lives,</v>

943
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.353
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

944
00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:53.423
<v Speaker 1>why did the cops fire so many guns now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At one time I taught pistol shooting in </v>

945
00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:58.254
<v Speaker 1>the Marine Corp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't surprise me in the slightest </v>

946
00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 1>shots fired so many things under those </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>

947
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.043
<v Speaker 1>but people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can't be knowledgeable about </v>

948
00:46:06.751 --> 00:46:07.584
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can be knowledgeable about the </v>

949
00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:12.630
<v Speaker 1>extent of their own ignorance or even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have phds.</v>

950
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.713
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thIs has been a true honor and a </v>

951
00:46:16.911 --> 00:46:19.070
<v Speaker 1>pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know I can see it in your eyes,</v>

952
00:46:19.071 --> 00:46:19.904
<v Speaker 1>even the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of humility that you have in </v>

953
00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 1>humbleness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've,</v>

954
00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:22.873
<v Speaker 1>you've affected so many people and are </v>
<v Speaker 1>still continuing to affect so many </v>

955
00:46:25.341 --> 00:46:27.380
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope that we might have just given</v>

956
00:46:27.381 --> 00:46:29.290
<v Speaker 1>that a little extra bump today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

957
00:46:29.291 --> 00:46:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm truly honored that you took the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

958
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Thank robots.</v>
