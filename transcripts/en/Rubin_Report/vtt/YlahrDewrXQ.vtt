1
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Let's go all the way back to one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite years,</v>

2
00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>1985,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talk about Russia today.</v>

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.890
<v Speaker 1>There's so much happening in the news </v>
<v Speaker 1>lately with this giant country,</v>

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>but since we're all in election mode </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in the United States,</v>

5
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:19.520
<v Speaker 1>pretty much all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the news about Russia is getting</v>

6
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>completely lost and there's a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.993
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the ongoing war with Russia in </v>

8
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:25.634
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has become the deadliest conflict </v>

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>since World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's estimated that over 400,000</v>

10
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>people have died so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sadly it seems that there's no light</v>

11
00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:36.884
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the rumors that wikileaks </v>

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.243
<v Speaker 1>is somehow working with the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>government to influence our election </v>

13
00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:43.844
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is become a big talking point in </v>

14
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:46.364
<v Speaker 1>democratic circles as wikileaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to drop information about </v>

15
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emails and Clinton Foundation donors,</v>

16
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>even Julian Assan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wiki leaks,</v>

17
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:55.964
<v Speaker 1>editor in chief is promising more </v>
<v Speaker 1>October surprises and clearly they're </v>

18
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 1>not going to be aimed at helping hilary </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the Democrats on top of those issues.</v>

19
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of other reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that Vladimir Putin sees America</v>

20
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>in retreat around the world and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to fill that void.</v>

21
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Russia is occupied Ukraine for two years</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and it's clear that Russia is making</v>

22
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>moves throughout Syria without us </v>
<v Speaker 1>approval.</v>

23
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes indirect conflict with </v>
<v Speaker 1>American goals,</v>

24
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.690
<v Speaker 1>although it's completely unclear to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly those American goals are.</v>

25
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Only four years ago in America's last </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential election,</v>

26
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:31.694
<v Speaker 1>Mitt Romney was widely mocked for </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling Russia without question our </v>

27
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:36.434
<v Speaker 1>number one geopolitical foe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet now it seems that it's the </v>

28
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:40.634
<v Speaker 1>Democrats who are leaning more hawkish </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Russia just listened to hillary or </v>

29
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:44.774
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kaine and the debate so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the democratic nominees are much more </v>

30
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.524
<v Speaker 1>anti Russia then either trump or pence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is trump to close to Putin or does he </v>

31
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>have other Russian business interests in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind?</v>

32
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be a new cold war brewing,</v>

33
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>but this time there may not be a rocky </v>
<v Speaker 1>Balboa verse.</v>

34
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Ivan Drago boxing match on Christmas Day</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Mascoutah help us work things out.</v>

35
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.600
<v Speaker 1>While I don't think there's any </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate reason that a direct conflict</v>

36
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:12.434
<v Speaker 1>with Russia is on the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think it's important that we start </v>

37
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:15.734
<v Speaker 1>talking about are deeply complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with Russia in an open and </v>

38
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>honest way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just by demonizing and making fun of</v>

39
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which don't get me wrong,</v>

40
00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:28.340
<v Speaker 1>he makes it very easy to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by really understanding what's going</v>

41
00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 1>on within Russia and the geopolitical </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances which have led us to where</v>

42
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 1>we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't do a little homework now,</v>

43
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.810
<v Speaker 1>then we'll all be easily manipulated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>both politicians as well as by the media</v>

44
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>that has their own goals in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boogie men are a lot less scary when you</v>

45
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:46.274
<v Speaker 1>know a little bit about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is author and </v>

46
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:51.080
<v Speaker 1>columnist Cathy Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kathy grew up in Russia until the age of</v>

47
00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>16 when she moved to the United States.</v>

48
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.850
<v Speaker 1>She's written for the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Washington Post,</v>

49
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>the Wall Street Journal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as my hometown newspaper.</v>

50
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>She focuses on some of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>topics,</v>

51
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>including political correctness and free</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

52
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.343
<v Speaker 1>and from what I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she equally calls out the bad elements </v>

53
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>of both the regressive left and the alt </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

54
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.613
<v Speaker 1>She's also been an outspoken critic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern feminism and a defender of the </v>

55
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:15.214
<v Speaker 1>men's rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those she sees some issues with that </v>

56
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>movement as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've you,</v>

57
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:19.924
<v Speaker 1>Cathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the few people really trying </v>

58
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.174
<v Speaker 1>to take both sides to task and give both</v>
<v Speaker 1>sides a chance before forming her own </v>

59
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:31.441
<v Speaker 1>opinions all the while not being too </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to a specific ideology,</v>

60
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.123
<v Speaker 1>not being locked into a specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology and being intellectually </v>

61
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:37.144
<v Speaker 1>flexible is one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes you can have and one that I </v>

62
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>consistently strive to have for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last few months had been interesting</v>

63
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:45.274
<v Speaker 1>as we've seen many never trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans slowly fall in line to a </v>

64
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:49.504
<v Speaker 1>lesser degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen it with the Bernie Bros who </v>

65
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>seemed far less inclined to go all in </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Hillary.</v>

66
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.903
<v Speaker 1>The wider point here though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that everyone is making their own </v>

67
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>calculations and decisions based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information around them.</v>

68
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>The key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you believe,</v>

69
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.294
<v Speaker 1>is to have access to new ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts and to have conversations </v>

70
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>that'll either enforce your beliefs or </v>
<v Speaker 1>change them for the better.</v>

71
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.500
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is an author and </v>
<v Speaker 1>columnist who's written for the New York</v>

72
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.333
<v Speaker 1>Times and Wall Street Journal and is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular contributor to reason and my </v>

73
00:04:23.191 --> 00:04:25.200
<v Speaker 1>hometown newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newsday,</v>

74

<v Speaker 1>I am a long islander.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Born in Brooklyn.</v>

78
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Grew up in long island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in New York City my whole life.</v>

79
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Now here I am in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a Jersey girl though,</v>

80
00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:41.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

81
00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:42.474
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am originally from Russia yet we're </v>

82
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:44.994
<v Speaker 1>going to get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have been a jersey girl since </v>

83
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:52.020
<v Speaker 1>1981,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it has actually been a while.</v>

84
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like a book right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From Jersey.</v>

85
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>From Russia to Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia to Jersey.</v>

86
00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:57.624
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did write a book called growing up in </v>

87
00:04:58.771 --> 00:04:59.604
<v Speaker 1>Moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was my first book came out in 89 </v>

88
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.380
<v Speaker 1>when I was fresh out of college.</v>

89
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.300
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly where I want to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

91
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.053
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well done.</v>

92
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in my direct message,</v>

93
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I talked a bit about Russia and I have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that in the next month or so we're</v>

94
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:18.000
<v Speaker 1>going to be hearing a lot more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia between what's going on in Syria,</v>

95
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.753
<v Speaker 1>talking about the Wiki leaks stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>is there somehow a connection that they </v>

97
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:25.260
<v Speaker 1>want to take down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary does,</v>

98
00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:26.094
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does trump have a business ties to </v>

99
00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this stuff.</v>

100
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.450
<v Speaker 1>So let's go back to your first 16 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it like growing up,</v>

101
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russia and uh,</v>

102
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.650
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to give me your exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

103
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:41.640
<v Speaker 1>give me a rough estimate of the years </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was born in 1965.</v>

104
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never,</v>

105
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.210
<v Speaker 1>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

106
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine with that.</v>

107
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

108
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:48.450
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about growing up in Russia.</v>

109
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.303
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was growing up in the president of a </v>

110
00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:56.061
<v Speaker 1>years and it was interesting because at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time it really seemed like the,</v>

111
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>that existed</v>

112
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 2>at the time was really forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

113
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 2>and it was funny because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

114
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.580
<v Speaker 2>there was a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

115
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.630
<v Speaker 2>by Russian dissident named Andrea Mora,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Willis Soviet Union existed until</v>

116
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:14.890
<v Speaker 2>1984 and he picked that day because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Orwell,</v>

117
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's so bizarre because at the time,</v>

118
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard about this book,</v>

119
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father was a kind of,</v>

120
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.513
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both my parents were really kind of </v>

121
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 2>closet dissidents and we had banned </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature on the house.</v>

122
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what was bad,</v>

123
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.110
<v Speaker 2>what type of literature was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>banned.</v>

124
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that was critical of,</v>

125
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Soviet system social needs.</v>

126
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:41.310
<v Speaker 2>And of course the works of dissidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

127
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.000
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

128
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 2>there is her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not even really formally banned,</v>

129
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 2>but kind of really frowned upon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

130
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

131
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:51.734
<v Speaker 2>the early years of the Soviet regime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people who were executed for being </v>

132
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.000
<v Speaker 2>a sort of an opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm war.</v>

133
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course was done.</v>

134
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't actually get to read it until I</v>

135
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 2>had left the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

136
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because a number of </v>

137
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:10.880
<v Speaker 2>people who read or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

138
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:11.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

139
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was called Samas dot,</v>

140
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:14.534
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these typewritten leaflets that were </v>

141
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.933
<v Speaker 2>kind of passed around from person to </v>
<v Speaker 2>person underground of people who read </v>

142
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.163
<v Speaker 2>world who read or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sort of smuggled in for an to a lot </v>

143
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:29.714
<v Speaker 2>of people in the Soviet Union really </v>
<v Speaker 2>were shocked to learn that orwell had </v>

144
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 2>never actually been to the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were sure that we're,</v>

145
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like George Orwell must've been like the</v>

146
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.873
<v Speaker 2>pen name for our Russian emigre because </v>
<v Speaker 2>who else could have understood the </v>

147
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.820
<v Speaker 2>system so well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

148
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

149
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 2>And the sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pressure of,</v>

150
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:52.544
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pressure to conform to the dominant </v>

151
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

152
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

153
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.843
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andre Amalric who picked that date </v>

154
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.050
<v Speaker 2>because of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

155
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 2>the book 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

156
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 2>And at the time when I first started </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>

157
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.063
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one could really imagine that this </v>

158
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.374
<v Speaker 2>would sort of come true because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually doesn't exist that long passed </v>

159
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 2>the 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:21.440
<v Speaker 2>he was off by 70 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when I was growing up,</v>

161
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:22.274
<v Speaker 2>no one really could have imagined that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's kind of a useful </v>

162
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 2>thing to keep in mind when we think of </v>
<v Speaker 2>today's events in the sense that,</v>

163
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:30.764
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really have no idea whatsoever what </v>

164
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 2>the world is going to look like in five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

165
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:39.680
<v Speaker 2>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are really unpredictable.</v>

166
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.713
<v Speaker 2>They really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I did the direct message </v>

167
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.910
<v Speaker 2>because I want people to have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge about some of this stuff.</v>

168
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.420
<v Speaker 2>So the second we start hearing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

169
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 2>I know we're not all caught guard and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no cancer,</v>

170
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of what it was like to grow up,</v>

171
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.131
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

172
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 2>in the Soviet Union.</v>

173
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 2>And it's really difficult to answer on </v>
<v Speaker 2>one word because,</v>

174
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't in many ways it was a complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

176
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 2>It was not the same as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't in Stalin era where,</v>

177
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.743
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really was kind of back down the </v>

178
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 2>height of the totalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

179
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.930
<v Speaker 2>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very little,</v>

180
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.793
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>information or content as we would say </v>

181
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was allowed to kind of seep in.</v>

182
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 2>That was not thoroughly filtered through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the official ideology.</v>

183
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

184
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

185
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.180
<v Speaker 2>back in the thirties and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.900
<v Speaker 2>even the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the fifties a dusty yefsky was bad.</v>

187
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

188
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.583
<v Speaker 2>not officially banned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but very difficult to get and certainly </v>

189
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 2>wasn't studied in schools and colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

190
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:47.751
<v Speaker 2>by the time that I was in a high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Russia,</v>

191
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.550
<v Speaker 2>we actually had a prime and punishment </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the curriculum.</v>

192
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

193
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

194
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 2>the things that mentioned religion were </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of allowed a,</v>

195
00:09:58.770 --> 00:09:59.603
<v Speaker 2>anything that really was not very </v>
<v Speaker 2>overtly critical of the Soviet Union </v>

196
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.163
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

197
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:09.250
<v Speaker 2>well Dr Chicago for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did have the experience of um,</v>

198
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up in a situation where when I </v>

199
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:15.354
<v Speaker 2>was maybe seven or eight years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I started going to school and I </v>

200
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:19.620
<v Speaker 2>started coming home and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

201
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in the best country in the world</v>

202
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 2>because we have communism.</v>

203
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 2>That was when my parents decided that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of had to explain to me that,</v>

204
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

205
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:29.960
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not really quick.</v>

206
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Can do some of those leaflets that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going around the age of seven,</v>

207
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:35.694
<v Speaker 2>but they just kind of talked to me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of gave me a little bit of an </v>

208
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 2>explanation of what was what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

209
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.413
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember very well my mother </v>

210
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:46.810
<v Speaker 2>telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

211
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 2>he really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot tell anyone at school what we</v>

212
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 2>talk about at home because otherwise you</v>
<v Speaker 2>will go to jail.</v>

213
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not even sure that they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have because again,</v>

214
00:10:57.661 --> 00:10:58.890
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 2>things were a little more flexible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>open that they used to be.</v>

216
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually know of a situation,</v>

217
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.493
<v Speaker 2>a friends of my parents that they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden started talking in kindergarten </v>

218
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 2>about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

219
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:12.384
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad was saying that Lennon was </v>

220
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 2>really not the greatest person who ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived.</v>

221
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.220
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nothing.</v>

222
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.243
<v Speaker 2>But actually he has one of the teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the kindergarten teachers called </v>

223
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 2>that his mom and said and basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

224
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:30.294
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care what you talk about </v>

225
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.940
<v Speaker 2>at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

226
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:36.340
<v Speaker 2>please don't do it in front of the kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know who else is going</v>

227
00:11:36.341 --> 00:11:37.174
<v Speaker 2>to tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was pretty a pretty enlightened </v>

228
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.603
<v Speaker 2>for the teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in this society there was a lot of </v>

229
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.690
<v Speaker 2>kind of flexibility under the radar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

230
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.960
<v Speaker 2>But officially it was all very conform </v>
<v Speaker 2>as we had to at school.</v>

231
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.893
<v Speaker 2>We had to attend these mandatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>meetings where everyone had to kind of </v>

232
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:02.300
<v Speaker 2>repeat the slogans and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

233
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sing the praises of the Soviet Union.</v>

234
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 2>And this is actually one reason that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the stuff that was going on today</v>

235
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 2>in American universities really </v>
<v Speaker 2>resonates with me because,</v>

236
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying to my mom,</v>

237
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 2>my dad passed away two years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

238
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 2>But I've been saying to my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

239
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 2>this really feels like the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they heard you.</v>

240
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:22.984
<v Speaker 2>And so these meetings where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit there and say all the right things </v>

241
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to say,</v>

242
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things you're not allowed to say is that</v>

243
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.813
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to say the things you're </v>

244
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 2>supposed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

245
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I'm listening,</v>

246
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely see that through line.</v>

247
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:44.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

248
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one gets hurt into the gulag,</v>

249
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:47.914
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their resident.</v>

250
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

251
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 2>when I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did know that he could,</v>

252
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't very likely maybe,</v>

253
00:12:54.031 --> 00:12:56.970
<v Speaker 2>but you could go to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

254
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.350
<v Speaker 2>for um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 2>saying heretical things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

256
00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:07.570
<v Speaker 2>we are kind of getting to the point in </v>
<v Speaker 2>many areas of society where you can lose</v>

257
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:09.160
<v Speaker 2>your job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

258
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.023
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for saying the wrong thing or </v>

259
00:13:11.401 --> 00:13:15.430
<v Speaker 2>ideologically which in the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 seventies,</v>

260
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.383
<v Speaker 2>that actually losing your job was a much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more likely outcome though I'm going to </v>

261
00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:21.251
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

262
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 2>unless you were actually like </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically active as a destination.</v>

263
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.553
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because I find that I </v>

264
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:32.640
<v Speaker 1>used to give anonymous people on line </v>
<v Speaker 1>more crap for being anonymous,</v>

265
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.080
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people would respond and so,</v>

266
00:13:34.081 --> 00:13:36.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lose my job right now.</v>

267
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>instances of that in the United States,</v>

268
00:13:39.631 --> 00:13:41.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's more about that chilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

269
00:13:41.461 --> 00:13:45.240
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about existed all the time.</v>

270
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.300
<v Speaker 1>So your parents never went to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really talk about this.</v>

271
00:13:48.301 --> 00:13:50.310
<v Speaker 1>It's funny for all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

272
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.173
<v Speaker 1>so 16 years old you moved here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it because you realized that there </v>

273
00:13:54.331 --> 00:13:55.920
<v Speaker 1>was this great opportunity</v>

274
00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.890
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

275
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.720
<v Speaker 2>they started really saying a Soviet Jews</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the seventies.</v>

276
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.990
<v Speaker 2>And my dad had actually talked for </v>
<v Speaker 2>several years about I'm leaving.</v>

277
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom was a little,</v>

278
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more uncertain about it.</v>

279
00:14:14.371 --> 00:14:18.600
<v Speaker 2>She had a job that she really loved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was teaching at one.</v>

280
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.900
<v Speaker 2>She's a music teacher and she actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>still teaches a,</v>

281
00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:26.901
<v Speaker 2>but she was teaching at one of the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>music schools in Moscow.</v>

282
00:14:26.941 --> 00:14:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

283
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.713
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had students that she was very </v>

284
00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:33.940
<v Speaker 2>attached to when she just really felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

285
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:34.843
<v Speaker 2>It was funny because she felt that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>would never find that kind of work in </v>

286
00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:40.500
<v Speaker 2>the US and she actually ended up doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty well,</v>

287
00:14:40.501 --> 00:14:41.460
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

288
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.720
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

289
00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:43.554
<v Speaker 2>so she was a little hesitant and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>also just sort of the general </v>

290
00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:47.670
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

291
00:14:47.671 --> 00:14:50.340
<v Speaker 2>moving to a whole new country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning a new language.</v>

292
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 2>And I went to a school that specializes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in English by the way.</v>

293
00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:55.274
<v Speaker 2>So I started learning English when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>about seven and it wasn't really at the </v>

294
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:04.340
<v Speaker 2>time with a view to going to America </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually it was just because,</v>

295
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:05.174
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a better school than most and it </v>

296
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:08.084
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because of English there was </v>

297
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:11.024
<v Speaker 2>also more exposure to materials that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't normally see on a curriculum </v>

298
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:19.010
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

299
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:19.641
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

300
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:23.510
<v Speaker 2>for me it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in terms of language,</v>

301
00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:26.280
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't quite as intimidating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

302
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 2>my parents really did have to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>start all over again.</v>

303
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.850
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if finally,</v>

304
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

305
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

306
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.263
<v Speaker 2>my parents both felt that things were </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting worst were the end of the </v>

307
00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

308
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

309
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one knew what was going to happen.</v>

310
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

311
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.493
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people thought that there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a kind of resurgence of </v>

312
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Stalinist type,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

313
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really harsh,</v>

314
00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.593
<v Speaker 2>brutal dictatorship where you could go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to present and very easily for saying </v>

315
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 2>the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

316
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.210
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point you were,</v>

317
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.080
<v Speaker 2>you were allowed to just pick up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>

318
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Your parents were allowed to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

319
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.530
<v Speaker 2>we're leaving now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just,</v>

320
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.161
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

321
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:13.431
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

322
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 2>It certainly wasn't that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

323
00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:18.590
<v Speaker 2>you had to apply for permission to </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>

324
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

325
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:21.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not for any one of,</v>

326
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.563
<v Speaker 2>was basically limited to so good Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were officially being allowed to </v>

327
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:31.811
<v Speaker 2>leave for like repatriation to Israel </v>
<v Speaker 2>and worth family reunification.</v>

328
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.820
<v Speaker 2>And they really like the Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't letting the Jews leave.</v>

329
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Is that pretty much the antisemitism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was another thing.</v>

330
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:46.280
<v Speaker 2>The antisemitism was growing much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticeable.</v>

331
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.793
<v Speaker 2>It was getting to be very difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a young Jewish people to get into </v>

332
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:54.410
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

333
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

334
00:16:56.361 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 2>my parents personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new situations where,</v>

335
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids who were extremely good students,</v>

336
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.163
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were basically blog bull during the </v>

337
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:09.230
<v Speaker 2>admission exams and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was this completely closed system</v>

338
00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:10.064
<v Speaker 2>where they didn't have to tell you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you had failed on the exams and </v>

339
00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:14.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

340
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really,</v>

341
00:17:15.831 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 2>really easy to kind of kill you if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they wanted to,</v>

342
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.070
<v Speaker 2>especially since part of the infants </v>
<v Speaker 2>exam,</v>

343
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:22.904
<v Speaker 2>by the way was Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leninism and quiz here you had to write </v>

344
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:29.350
<v Speaker 2>all these tuxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

345
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.510
<v Speaker 2>the plenary session of the Communist </v>
<v Speaker 2>Party in 1956 and then they can quiz you</v>

346
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 2>on the stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

347
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.860
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was really,</v>

348
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.950
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they wanted to failure,</v>

349
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.900
<v Speaker 2>it was just really easy to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

350
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:46.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 2>and I think that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was another reason that prompted my</v>

352
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:52.890
<v Speaker 2>parents to finally decide to leave.</v>

353
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.050
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we officially,</v>

354
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.213
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were emigrating to reunite with my </v>

355
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:02.130
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his aunt and Israel.</v>

356
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what,</v>

357
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.170
<v Speaker 2>how it was the whole thing kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>existed under Jackson Vanik.</v>

358
00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.790
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of an arrangement where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States where,</v>

359
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia was where the Soviet Union at the</v>

360
00:18:14.431 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 2>time was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

361
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.323
<v Speaker 2>kind of benefits and trade with the US </v>
<v Speaker 2>in exchange for allowing Soviet Jews to </v>

362
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:24.220
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

363
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.733
<v Speaker 2>and I think there were a few other </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups like pentecostal Christians who </v>

364
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:34.710
<v Speaker 2>were kind of a very persecuted sucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were also part of that,</v>

365
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:38.610
<v Speaker 2>but mainly it was Soviet Jews say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

366
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.460
<v Speaker 2>once you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you actually left the Soviet Union,</v>

367
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:42.294
<v Speaker 2>then you got to Vienna as a way station </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you've got a choice of did you </v>

368
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:48.470
<v Speaker 2>want to go to Israel or did you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the states?</v>

369
00:18:48.471 --> 00:18:51.210
<v Speaker 2>So you told them or they were under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>impression you were going to Israel,</v>

370
00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:52.380
<v Speaker 2>but then you went to the United States.</v>

371
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I think they kind of knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

372
00:18:55.741 --> 00:18:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I think they knew what was going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think at the time,</v>

373
00:18:58.711 --> 00:18:59.544
<v Speaker 2>like by the time that we were leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about 80 percent of the Soviet </v>

374
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:02.994
<v Speaker 2>Jews who were at a grading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're actually going to the United </v>

375
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't really care.</v>

376
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:09.510
<v Speaker 2>So what was it like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sort of had the benefit of,</v>

377
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.523
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking English at an early age and go </v>

378
00:19:11.861 --> 00:19:12.860
<v Speaker 2>into A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

379
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 2>what was it like though to move to New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jersey?</v>

380
00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:19.840
<v Speaker 2>16 and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he actually wasn't.</v>

381
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.860
<v Speaker 2>My very first statement was Jackson </v>
<v Speaker 2>Heights,</v>

382
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:25.680
<v Speaker 2>Queens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Queens.</v>

383
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

384
00:19:27.331 --> 00:19:28.590
<v Speaker 2>this is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

385
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I actually um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked uh,</v>

386
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.870
<v Speaker 2>for about six months before my parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually found work in Jersey and that</v>

387
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.500
<v Speaker 2>was why we ended up moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

388
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.383
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a while I was the main breadwinner </v>

389
00:19:41.911 --> 00:19:45.240
<v Speaker 2>because I was the person with English </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

390
00:19:45.241 --> 00:19:50.241
<v Speaker 2>I had a job as a secretary with the boy </v>
<v Speaker 2>scouts of America,</v>

391
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.750
<v Speaker 2>New York chapter.</v>

392
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

393
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:53.893
<v Speaker 2>because I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew how to type and I knew how to </v>

394
00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:59.340
<v Speaker 2>tighten Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I rented a,</v>

395
00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 2>a typewriter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an English keyboard typewriter,</v>

396
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:08.871
<v Speaker 2>and it took me about a week to relearn </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to type in English and I'm like,</v>

397
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.820
<v Speaker 2>what was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

398
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.510
<v Speaker 2>you go from Russia and now you're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>breadwinner for your parents in this new</v>

399
00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:17.550
<v Speaker 2>country learning a new job and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

400
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.210
<v Speaker 2>how did that feel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

401
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 2>actually felt really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

402
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

403
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:24.643
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole period of my life was </v>

404
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:28.070
<v Speaker 2>actually quite exciting because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

405
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the mirror experience of going </v>

406
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:32.730
<v Speaker 2>abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

407
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:37.440
<v Speaker 2>and my father actually had traveled a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit because he was a musician.</v>

408
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had traveled with the Moscow Symphony</v>

409
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Orchestra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was actually mainly,</v>

410
00:20:43.621 --> 00:20:45.210
<v Speaker 2>he was a sound producer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

411
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

412
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.150
<v Speaker 2>for the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was also a violinist and uh,</v>

413
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did occasionally get the travel.</v>

414
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.800
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

415
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had some interesting experiences to.</v>

416
00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:55.834
<v Speaker 2>He was actually in England in 1968 when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia </v>

417
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.720
<v Speaker 2>and he would have defected for sure if </v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have a family back home.</v>

418
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.220
<v Speaker 2>And my mom actually wasn't even sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was coming back because when she</v>

419
00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 2>heard about the invasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

420
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.123
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>

421
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.120
<v Speaker 2>He's going to the doctor.</v>

422
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

423
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:19.830
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

424
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:20.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he bought.</v>

425
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.600
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

426
00:21:21.601 --> 00:21:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was very,</v>

427
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 2>very talented and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

428
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.543
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he was tempted to actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it because he knew that he had a </v>

429
00:21:31.561 --> 00:21:34.920
<v Speaker 2>family back home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he did say,</v>

430
00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if it wasn't for that,</v>

431
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably would have made that </v>

432
00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:42.860
<v Speaker 2>decision because it was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

433
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.960
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had the experience of uh,</v>

434
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

435
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.610
<v Speaker 2>being sort of booed by the woodlands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>London.</v>

436
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really,</v>

437
00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 1>really trying for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

438
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know we could go on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being an immigrant.</v>

439
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

440
00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:07.740
<v Speaker 1>it was</v>

441
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:08.573
<v Speaker 2>really exciting because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was this whole world of information </v>

442
00:22:11.791 --> 00:22:13.620
<v Speaker 2>that had opened up to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

443
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading</v>

444
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.410
<v Speaker 1>well and reading his paper</v>

445
00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.283
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember I just the experience </v>

446
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.630
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually still remember this,</v>

447
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we came here,</v>

448
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:29.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I opened,</v>

449
00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:30.814
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the New York Post and </v>

450
00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.084
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was shortly before Reagan was </v>

451
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:38.920
<v Speaker 2>elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

452
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I opened the New York Post and I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

453
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:45.030
<v Speaker 1>really mean cartoon of Jimmy Carter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

454
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:50.430
<v Speaker 1>this is just the president and here was </v>
<v Speaker 1>this cartoon.</v>

455
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.690
<v Speaker 1>It basically did some as a complainant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love that.</v>

456
00:22:55.981 --> 00:23:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I love obviously frame so much of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you write about and,</v>

457
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:05.190
<v Speaker 1>and that was just an amazing and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just suddenly,</v>

458
00:23:05.191 --> 00:23:06.024
<v Speaker 1>I mean I still remember that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was this moment that really </v>

459
00:23:09.481 --> 00:23:11.360
<v Speaker 1>crystallized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:15.450
<v Speaker 1>the fact of being in a free country that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually do this.</v>

461
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And I want to talk about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues of being in a free country,</v>

462
00:23:21.661 --> 00:23:22.494
<v Speaker 1>but let's do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do one other thing on first </v>

463
00:23:25.201 --> 00:23:27.500
<v Speaker 1>because I mentioned some stuff about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia up top.</v>

464
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:31.590
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of just generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening with Russia now?</v>

465
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's spend a couple minutes on that.</v>

466
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.453
<v Speaker 1>Putin is really trying to fill this void</v>
<v Speaker 1>that America seems to be leaving in the </v>

467
00:23:39.121 --> 00:23:39.771
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

468
00:23:39.771 --> 00:23:42.810
<v Speaker 1>what is going on in Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have they officially taken Ukraine?</v>

469
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.690
<v Speaker 1>GimMe Gimme state of</v>

470
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Russia on the state of Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

471
00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:51.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

472
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 2>pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely ever since he came to power,</v>

473
00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 2>it's been increasingly clear that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think he wants to,</v>

474
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuild a Russia as a superpower.</v>

475
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 2>It can really return to what the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union was,</v>

476
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.843
<v Speaker 2>although I'm not really sure he </v>
<v Speaker 2>understands that he took Ukraine right </v>

477
00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:13.290
<v Speaker 2>or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

478
00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.070
<v Speaker 2>well he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took Crimea.</v>

479
00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:16.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is this view that puts in a sort </v>

480
00:24:19.671 --> 00:24:21.900
<v Speaker 2>of super humanly claver right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

481
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's this great strategist.</v>

482
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure that's the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

483
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

484
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:29.983
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguably he could have gotten further </v>

485
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.530
<v Speaker 2>with Ukraine if he had just maintained </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

486
00:24:36.531 --> 00:24:37.364
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to maintain a friendly </v>

487
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 2>relationship with them then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.120
<v Speaker 2>trade and so on without actually trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to force his person.</v>

489
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say his puppet because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

490
00:24:50.181 --> 00:24:51.014
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even really sure that the </v>

491
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:57.740
<v Speaker 2>president who was a who was removed was </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely a puppet of the prevalent,</v>

492
00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.873
<v Speaker 2>but he was definitely sort of Putin's </v>
<v Speaker 2>man and I think he in a way kind of </v>

493
00:25:03.471 --> 00:25:04.670
<v Speaker 2>overplayed his hand.</v>

494
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ukraine.</v>

495
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.373
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean right now he's in a situation </v>

496
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:10.844
<v Speaker 2>where he's much better at kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>messing things up for other countries </v>

497
00:25:14.661 --> 00:25:17.660
<v Speaker 2>than he is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

498
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 2>actually doing something good for Russia</v>
<v Speaker 2>because right now for instance,</v>

499
00:25:21.621 --> 00:25:24.740
<v Speaker 2>the situation with Ukraine is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

500
00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.693
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new government in Ukraine is not </v>

501
00:25:30.651 --> 00:25:35.651
<v Speaker 2>really able to push through the reforms </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are ones partly because it's bogged</v>

502
00:25:36.891 --> 00:25:37.724
<v Speaker 2>down in this endless kind of undeclared </v>
<v Speaker 2>war that's going on in the eastern </v>

503
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:43.190
<v Speaker 2>regions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

504
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:45.650
<v Speaker 2>they've got poor breathing down their </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck basically.</v>

505
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.750
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time Russia is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>bogged down in this.</v>

506
00:25:49.751 --> 00:25:54.751
<v Speaker 2>I'm declared war and it can really tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the stuff can kind of come back</v>

507
00:25:55.911 --> 00:25:56.744
<v Speaker 2>and bite Russia because they're creating</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of quasi mercenary army of </v>

508
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.840
<v Speaker 2>armed people who will have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience now of fighting.</v>

509
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.840
<v Speaker 2>And the guerrilla war and who knows what</v>
<v Speaker 2>will happen when these people are told,</v>

510
00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 2>well we don't need you anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of done with this.</v>

511
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.713
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prayed a lot of the stabilization in </v>

512
00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Russia itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

513
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.050
<v Speaker 2>and he and I could go on and on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>under does because he's also his god,</v>

514
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:27.913
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of got a tiger by the tail and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chechnya because basically he made a </v>

515
00:26:31.401 --> 00:26:36.401
<v Speaker 2>deal with a guy runs on Kadira of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of well you basically like,</v>

516
00:26:36.891 --> 00:26:41.891
<v Speaker 2>you make sure church now stays a Russian</v>
<v Speaker 2>province and you know,</v>

517
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:46.901
<v Speaker 2>you make sure that on God's 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the votes and judge now elections,</v>

518
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.030
<v Speaker 2>which I think he does and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make sure that,</v>

519
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:51.864
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get a cut of the oil profits and </v>

520
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 2>exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can really do anything you want.</v>

521
00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:59.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is actually kind of interesting</v>

522
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:00.234
<v Speaker 2>because I know that there are people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rights in the west who see Putin as </v>

523
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:08.490
<v Speaker 2>this kind of bull work of the fence </v>
<v Speaker 2>against Sharia law,</v>

524
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under Putin's leadership there as a part</v>

525
00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:14.910
<v Speaker 2>of the Russian Federation.</v>

526
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.150
<v Speaker 2>That is basically a Sharia state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has changed now.</v>

527
00:27:18.151 --> 00:27:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not many people know that this,</v>

528
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that it actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

529
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are forced to wear veils,</v>

530
00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:27.564
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a guy who was actually spoken </v>

531
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:32.310
<v Speaker 2>out in favor of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

532
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:37.530
<v Speaker 2>a polygamy which is technically illegal </v>
<v Speaker 2>under a Russian law and,</v>

533
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are people who have said like,</v>

534
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.073
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

535
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.630
<v Speaker 2>this guy is the president of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

536
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a republic that is part of the Russian </v>

537
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Federation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he doing?</v>

538
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Really advocating things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>contrary to the Russian constitution.</v>

539
00:27:53.251 --> 00:27:55.470
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who really cares because,</v>

540
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the law currently is votes to keep the </v>

541
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.440
<v Speaker 2>boats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also this guy is a Cadeira is,</v>

542
00:28:04.441 --> 00:28:07.190
<v Speaker 2>is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong and supporter.</v>

543
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

544
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 2>if necessary he will bring out his </v>
<v Speaker 2>troops that are loyal to him,</v>

545
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:13.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight.</v>

546
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

547
00:28:14.971 --> 00:28:15.540
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

548
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:20.540
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty well known that he's sent </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to eastern Ukraine to,</v>

549
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight in the guerrilla war there.</v>

550
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:24.151
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

551
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:24.984
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has kind of a tiger by the tail </v>

552
00:28:26.641 --> 00:28:31.641
<v Speaker 2>situation because if suddenly it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the stages for turn tournament,</v>

553
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what's going to happen.</v>

554
00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 2>And he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a pretty dangerous guy,</v>

555
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:37.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

556
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.320
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of the classic warlord who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

557
00:28:40.321 --> 00:28:42.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God as people who are extremely loyal,</v>

558
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:43.254
<v Speaker 2>they have a potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is quite as smart as his often given </v>

559
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:50.184
<v Speaker 2>credit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of the time when he's </v>

560
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.273
<v Speaker 2>succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mainly because of the failures of </v>

561
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:58.130
<v Speaker 2>the West because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

562
00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.630
<v Speaker 2>he has his side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>

563
00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:04.170
<v Speaker 2>he's good at stepping into the vacuum </v>
<v Speaker 2>that arises when,</v>

564
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.333
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in American leadership kind of pulls </v>

565
00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:09.450
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the perfect segue of course,</v>

566
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:10.284
<v Speaker 2>to everything that's going on in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he trying to accomplish in </v>

567
00:29:14.461 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is He really trying to.</v>

568
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 2>And I think part of that is really just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to signal that,</v>

569
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he stands behind US allies.</v>

570
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

571
00:29:26.671 --> 00:29:29.100
<v Speaker 2>he's a sensibly making noises about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

572
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:31.560
<v Speaker 2>creating the preconditions for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

573
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:34.260
<v Speaker 2>a sod to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to the opposition.</v>

574
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.393
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

575
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 2>given the way that put him treats the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition and Russia,</v>

576
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

577
00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:43.550
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't carpet bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

578
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's really,</v>

579
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.010
<v Speaker 2>other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of it,</v>

580
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.900
<v Speaker 2>he's really not a talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition guy.</v>

581
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.110
<v Speaker 2>He's more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

582
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.640
<v Speaker 2>kill the opposition quietly or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

583
00:29:57.641 --> 00:29:59.850
<v Speaker 2>put them in jail or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

584
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.270
<v Speaker 2>basically leave them with no </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutional support whatsoever guy.</v>

585
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:04.751
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

586
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

587
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really fairly clear that,</v>

588
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:09.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

589
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:14.020
<v Speaker 2>the murder of Boris Nemtsov who was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>forum at one point,</v>

590
00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:18.310
<v Speaker 2>a really popular governor who later </v>
<v Speaker 2>became part of the opposition.</v>

591
00:30:18.311 --> 00:30:20.040
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

592
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I think,</v>

593
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.890
<v Speaker 2>who had the charisma really to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

594
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.773
<v Speaker 2>to appeal to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that he actually was </v>

595
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.850
<v Speaker 2>directly a threat to put in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

596
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy might sell it.</v>

597
00:30:32.461 --> 00:30:36.850
<v Speaker 2>It's fairly clear that there was some </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of official hand in his murder.</v>

598
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

599
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.300
<v Speaker 2>I think that kind of tells you a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

600
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

601
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.880
<v Speaker 2>how puts in feels about dealing with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possession.</v>

602
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:49.210
<v Speaker 2>So basically the idea here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he wants to keep us on empower.</v>

603
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.393
<v Speaker 1>I think my guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably good for the economy at </v>

604
00:30:51.781 --> 00:30:52.610
<v Speaker 1>some level.</v>

605
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

606
00:30:55.441 --> 00:31:00.441
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's good for kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining strong man image both inside</v>

607
00:31:02.911 --> 00:31:03.744
<v Speaker 2>and outside Russia put there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I clearly kind of has an affinity with </v>

608
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.753
<v Speaker 2>dictators a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets pretty upset at regime change </v>

609
00:31:15.691 --> 00:31:17.140
<v Speaker 2>anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

610
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.233
<v Speaker 2>he was from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard stories and I got and you </v>

611
00:31:22.021 --> 00:31:24.990
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are sort of rumors from people who</v>

612
00:31:24.991 --> 00:31:26.850
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have been on the inside,</v>

613
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.103
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard that he was extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset by what happened to Qaddafi and </v>

614
00:31:32.701 --> 00:31:36.990
<v Speaker 2>that he really took that personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took it personally.</v>

615
00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what they may someday way.</v>

616
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:41.783
<v Speaker 2>And I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of his issues with the United </v>

617
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.750
<v Speaker 2>States and I think it goes back to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rock and a few other things.</v>

618
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.380
<v Speaker 2>But he really does see the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

619
00:31:52.381 --> 00:31:53.214
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting regime change around the </v>

620
00:31:54.661 --> 00:31:57.180
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

621
00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.480
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's part of this beef </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the US.</v>

622
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:00.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

623
00:32:00.961 --> 00:32:01.794
<v Speaker 1>so is that the irony of where we're at </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the moment that it seems to me that </v>

624
00:32:05.101 --> 00:32:05.934
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats and Hillary are more anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia than the Republicans at the </v>

625
00:32:09.931 --> 00:32:10.764
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe trump has business ties for </v>

626
00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.840
<v Speaker 1>going in and toppling Gaddafi and </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently now it came out that a lot of</v>

627
00:32:20.841 --> 00:32:24.620
<v Speaker 1>the leaders of the army were saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

628
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.733
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is some legitimacy to Putin's </v>

629
00:32:27.201 --> 00:32:28.130
<v Speaker 1>fears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

630
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.330
<v Speaker 1>if you were putting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

631
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.173
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

632
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:31.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

633
00:32:31.101 --> 00:32:32.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

634
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.700
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we'll look at it and I don't really</v>

635
00:32:34.701 --> 00:32:38.840
<v Speaker 2>want to get until the whole Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going,</v>

636
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.600
<v Speaker 2>we're going to spend the next hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the Middle East.</v>

637
00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:42.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand the kind of anti </v>

638
00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:48.584
<v Speaker 2>introduction of good men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've definitely overextended </v>

639
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:53.534
<v Speaker 2>ourselves and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things around the world that get </v>

640
00:32:56.931 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 2>us into really messy situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

641
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little skeptical of this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of line of argument that,</v>

642
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we've made such a mess.</v>

643
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.140
<v Speaker 2>There was this assumption that if only </v>
<v Speaker 2>it weren't for our intervention,</v>

644
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 2>like everything would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

645
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:19.790
<v Speaker 2>peaceful and quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's necessarily the case</v>

646
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:20.714
<v Speaker 2>and I think that in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because it kind of parallels </v>

647
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the left wing arguments about </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy.</v>

648
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Like the other day I saw somebody on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and I don't,</v>

649
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:30.794
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even sure why this came up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason they were talking </v>

650
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:34.311
<v Speaker 2>about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

651
00:33:34.311 --> 00:33:35.144
<v Speaker 2>well it was really Nixon who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for the genocide in </v>

652
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:38.864
<v Speaker 2>Cambodia.</v>

653
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for that.</v>

654
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.073
<v Speaker 2>So it's this mindset that somehow the </v>
<v Speaker 2>west is behind everything bad that </v>

655
00:33:52.881 --> 00:33:55.960
<v Speaker 2>happens in non western countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's again,</v>

656
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:59.960
<v Speaker 2>kind of ironic that we're seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same kind of mindset on the,</v>

657
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.000
<v Speaker 2>on the anti interventionist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

658
00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

659
00:34:03.171 --> 00:34:04.770
<v Speaker 2>this is not to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

660
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.710
<v Speaker 2>mistakes have been made so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really doesn't mean that,</v>

661
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>

662
00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:16.121
<v Speaker 2>if we hadn't blundered in Libya and Iraq</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>

663
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that region today would be just,</v>

664
00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:20.684
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what model of peace and quiet I don't </v>

665
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:25.130
<v Speaker 2>think that we have no idea by the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>what would have happened.</v>

666
00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.363
<v Speaker 2>But we do know that actually Iraq was </v>
<v Speaker 2>better and they were having basically </v>

667
00:34:29.721 --> 00:34:34.130
<v Speaker 2>free elections and then we left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had signed the thing to leave.</v>

668
00:34:34.131 --> 00:34:39.030
<v Speaker 2>But Obama is a collective responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>

669
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

670
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

671
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.870
<v Speaker 2>leaving aside the merits of the invasion</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

672
00:34:44.871 --> 00:34:45.704
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty clear that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration and Iraq post invasion </v>

673
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.250
<v Speaker 2>was very badly mismanaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

674
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.093
<v Speaker 2>I think that was part of why I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't able to get a deal that </v>

675
00:34:56.601 --> 00:34:58.700
<v Speaker 2>would have allowed us to keep some </v>
<v Speaker 2>troops there.</v>

676
00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

677
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:06.350
<v Speaker 2>we don't want them to all think what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying is that not everything all</v>

678
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:08.760
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

679
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.633
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that it's really whether you're </v>

680
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:15.140
<v Speaker 2>blaming George W dot Bush or whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a blaming Hillary.</v>

681
00:35:15.141 --> 00:35:16.970
<v Speaker 2>And Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

682
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:20.630
<v Speaker 2>it's really much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more complicated than that.</v>

683
00:35:20.631 --> 00:35:21.464
<v Speaker 2>There are forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's kind of ironic because in a </v>

684
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:27.230
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a ways demeaning really to the people</v>

685
00:35:27.231 --> 00:35:29.390
<v Speaker 2>in those countries to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

686
00:35:29.391 --> 00:35:30.224
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything they do is really only </v>

687
00:35:31.701 --> 00:35:32.534
<v Speaker 2>because of instigation and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have their own extremely </v>

688
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:42.240
<v Speaker 2>complicated history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

689
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do things for their own reasons.</v>

690
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously we're contribute for better or</v>

691
00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:50.510
<v Speaker 2>for worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

692
00:35:50.511 --> 00:35:52.980
<v Speaker 2>it's really an oversimplification to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

693
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:53.843
<v Speaker 2>oh well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of conservatives are saying </v>

694
00:35:55.261 --> 00:35:55.921
<v Speaker 2>that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

695
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:56.754
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary started this mess in the Middle </v>

696
00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.213
<v Speaker 2>East</v>

697
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:04.841
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

698
00:36:04.841 --> 00:36:07.030
<v Speaker 1>it always depends on where you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start history,</v>

699
00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.220
<v Speaker 1>because there was something called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ottoman Empire,</v>

700
00:36:09.221 --> 00:36:10.054
<v Speaker 1>that realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was the British empire </v>

701
00:36:11.741 --> 00:36:13.010
<v Speaker 1>and then the United States and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

702
00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:13.810
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

703
00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:14.291
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

704
00:36:14.291 --> 00:36:14.950
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

705
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.783
<v Speaker 1>let's move from some geo political stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's talk about the issues of the </v>

706
00:36:17.651 --> 00:36:17.980
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

707
00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.130
<v Speaker 1>let's come back to America for a moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's where you do most of your</v>

708
00:36:21.131 --> 00:36:22.180
<v Speaker 1>writing about now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

709
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:27.360
<v Speaker 2>no know I do actually write quite a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Russia because I do have,</v>

710
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

711
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.760
<v Speaker 2>the experience that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

712
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.950
<v Speaker 2>it was really helpful in assessing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening there.</v>

713
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

714
00:36:35.971 --> 00:36:37.260
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with,</v>

715
00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about the regressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and the alt right.</v>

716
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Which one would you prefer to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>

717
00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.970
<v Speaker 2>What feels like a better transition </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

718
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean like what I like to start?</v>

719
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were regressive laughter.</v>

720
00:36:49.931 --> 00:36:51.240
<v Speaker 1>All right first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

721
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:52.660
<v Speaker 1>let's do the alt right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

722
00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:54.693
<v Speaker 1>So let's do</v>

723
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.113
<v Speaker 2>Italy in Russia is a good kind of segue </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the alt right because I think that a </v>

724
00:36:59.781 --> 00:37:03.490
<v Speaker 2>lot of people on the outright have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

725
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put some cold.</v>

726
00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:06.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

727
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:07.314
<v Speaker 1>So how would you just give me your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course a lot of them are just </v>

728
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.480
<v Speaker 1>crumbling walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

729
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.170
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of trolls on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

730
00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.040
<v Speaker 1>we know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is,</v>

731
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.520
<v Speaker 1>what is your definition of the alt </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

732
00:37:17.521 --> 00:37:18.354
<v Speaker 1>What is the outright to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think nobody's defining it </v>

733
00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:21.600
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everyone,</v>

734
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:24.200
<v Speaker 1>everyone uses it for their own right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're on purpose</v>

735
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.083
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

736
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.750
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to define actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

737
00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:30.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there probably isn't a single.</v>

738
00:37:30.821 --> 00:37:32.360
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

739
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean it started maybe five or six </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

740
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:38.463
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a bunch of people on really obscure </v>

741
00:37:40.931 --> 00:37:45.931
<v Speaker 2>websites and there are these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of factions of the outright,</v>

742
00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.030
<v Speaker 2>some of which are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's the end.</v>

743
00:37:49.031 --> 00:37:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really written about the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>neoreaction array,</v>

744
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.833
<v Speaker 2>so called dub phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really about a kind of going </v>

745
00:37:58.001 --> 00:38:02.740
<v Speaker 2>back to pre democracy political </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions,</v>

746
00:38:02.741 --> 00:38:03.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are three pro monitor </v>

747
00:38:05.411 --> 00:38:07.570
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of a nonstarter.</v>

748
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.433
<v Speaker 2>The United States.</v>

749
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not tear up the whole system.</v>

750
00:38:11.711 --> 00:38:12.544
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

751
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:15.800
<v Speaker 2>But I think today what people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

752
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:16.723
<v Speaker 2>with people we usually have referred to </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they talk about the alt right is </v>

753
00:38:21.441 --> 00:38:24.590
<v Speaker 2>it's more kind of white nationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>segments.</v>

754
00:38:24.591 --> 00:38:27.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think that has primarily come to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

755
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:32.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated especially with the,</v>

756
00:38:32.541 --> 00:38:34.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trump campaign,</v>

757
00:38:34.701 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

758
00:38:36.131 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alt right has been kind of a,</v>

759
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:40.820
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an affiliate.</v>

760
00:38:40.821 --> 00:38:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

761
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

762
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.840
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my.</v>

763
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.320
<v Speaker 1>My take on it has been that when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>refer to the alt right,</v>

764
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:48.154
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're referring to this white </v>

765
00:38:49.121 --> 00:38:52.120
<v Speaker 1>nationalist group of people and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>neonazis in that thing.</v>

766
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.253
<v Speaker 1>My feeling about it from what I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being online and talking to people </v>

767
00:38:56.471 --> 00:38:57.304
<v Speaker 1>and seeing what people send me things is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a huge percentage of the alt right </v>

768
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:05.130
<v Speaker 1>is just really disaffected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who love memes and they love shit</v>

769
00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:09.700
<v Speaker 1>posting and sending a Nazi imagery to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and all this stuff.</v>

770
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:10.534
<v Speaker 1>Not because they're Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're so frustrated with the </v>

771
00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:15.160
<v Speaker 1>system that they're just trying to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

772
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not apologizing for them and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like getting those things.</v>

773
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.353
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure we get as long as they're not </v>

774
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 1>trying to physically harm anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>

775
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.003
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the white nationalist subset of it </v>

776
00:39:25.331 --> 00:39:26.164
<v Speaker 1>obviously exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it actually strikes me as a small </v>

777
00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:29.254
<v Speaker 1>portion of a movement that really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pissed it conservatives that are </v>

778
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.740
<v Speaker 1>pissed at the people on the right who </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do the things they said they were</v>

779
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pissed at the system,</v>

780
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:38.440
<v Speaker 1>they're pissed at the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

781
00:39:38.441 --> 00:39:42.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the things that I actually do </v>
<v Speaker 1>care about yet,</v>

782
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:42.963
<v Speaker 1>there is absolutely a truly Zena phobic </v>
<v Speaker 1>component to it that doesn't like black </v>

783
00:39:47.141 --> 00:39:48.460
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't like Muslims,</v>

784
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.661
<v Speaker 1>gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews,</v>

785
00:39:49.661 --> 00:39:50.494
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's fair to say that </v>

786
00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:52.684
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

787
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:53.703
<v Speaker 2>it's really difficult to estimate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentages because it's not like it's </v>

788
00:39:58.071 --> 00:39:58.904
<v Speaker 2>not a movement where you can do a poll </v>
<v Speaker 2>and find out what percentage of people </v>

789
00:40:04.581 --> 00:40:07.790
<v Speaker 2>who are sort of affiliated with the alt </v>
<v Speaker 2>right online,</v>

790
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.033
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or actually just sort of disaffected </v>

791
00:40:10.701 --> 00:40:13.700
<v Speaker 2>conservatives or libertarians who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

792
00:40:13.701 --> 00:40:18.701
<v Speaker 2>like names and shit posting or former </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal liberal.</v>

793
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As opposed to,</v>

794
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual white nationalists or uh,</v>

795
00:40:24.531 --> 00:40:25.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even neo Nazis,</v>

796
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a know how many people are</v>

797
00:40:29.421 --> 00:40:32.930
<v Speaker 2>actually involved because a lot of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be like,</v>

798
00:40:32.931 --> 00:40:37.931
<v Speaker 2>one person was the 30 handles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be like a,</v>

799
00:40:38.091 --> 00:40:40.460
<v Speaker 2>what was that guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joshua Goldberg.</v>

800
00:40:40.461 --> 00:40:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Remember this was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Jewish guy who had all these different</v>

801
00:40:45.291 --> 00:40:47.540
<v Speaker 2>identities including,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

802
00:40:47.541 --> 00:40:49.280
<v Speaker 2>including a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He posted.</v>

803
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an amazing story.</v>

804
00:40:52.251 --> 00:40:54.770
<v Speaker 2>And I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he eventually got a rust,</v>

805
00:40:54.771 --> 00:40:57.560
<v Speaker 2>the current season of south park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're watching,</v>

806
00:40:57.561 --> 00:40:59.000
<v Speaker 2>but I know I know.</v>

807
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.423
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he eventually got arrested I think </v>

808
00:41:01.821 --> 00:41:05.940
<v Speaker 2>for a raw trying to stage some kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist attack.</v>

809
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.793
<v Speaker 2>Like he was talking to some radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims online also and I think he was </v>

810
00:41:10.161 --> 00:41:13.430
<v Speaker 2>trying to persuade them that he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical Muslim too.</v>

811
00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:14.893
<v Speaker 2>And so he was trolling every one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had some personas that really </v>

812
00:41:19.281 --> 00:41:20.130
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

813
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.760
<v Speaker 2>that we're all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

814
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:24.210
<v Speaker 2>we could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

815
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:27.170
<v Speaker 2>dealing with you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

816
00:41:27.171 --> 00:41:29.240
<v Speaker 2>you never really know who we are dealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

817
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:30.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be dealing with a teenager who </v>

818
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.330
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in his parents bail basement,</v>

819
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pretending to be like 10 or 15 </v>

820
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 1>different people on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what do you make of the,</v>

821
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:45.680
<v Speaker 1>of the strength of it then Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Hillary calls out the alt right,</v>

822
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.700
<v Speaker 1>are we talking about an actual political</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement here or</v>

823
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.300
<v Speaker 2>is something of a political movement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

824
00:41:53.301 --> 00:41:55.970
<v Speaker 2>we know that there are these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people,</v>

825
00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>websites like vade there,</v>

826
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are real people,</v>

827
00:42:00.411 --> 00:42:01.600
<v Speaker 2>those are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

828
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:05.390
<v Speaker 2>teenagers a pretending to be somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

829
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>posting from their parents' basement.</v>

830
00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now how much do they actually have?</v>

831
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows.</v>

832
00:42:13.191 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that there's a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement there.</v>

833
00:42:15.171 --> 00:42:16.004
<v Speaker 2>I think that they are gaining a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>visibility recently and it's really </v>

834
00:42:21.441 --> 00:42:25.070
<v Speaker 2>difficult to even know how to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>those because in a way of course,</v>

835
00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 2>by criticizing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

836
00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:30.440
<v Speaker 2>people like me aren't giving them more </v>
<v Speaker 2>visibility,</v>

837
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.220
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time I do kind of feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it is important to.</v>

838
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.300
<v Speaker 2>And I really hate the word call out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's been so thoroughly kind of,</v>

839
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:40.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate.</v>

840
00:42:40.041 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duh,</v>

841
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Duh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot Hughes by the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

843
00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.080
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that it's important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>point to this and say,</v>

844
00:42:48.081 --> 00:42:48.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

845
00:42:48.591 --> 00:42:51.110
<v Speaker 2>this was really going on in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was not a good thing.</v>

846
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.960
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

847
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:57.990
<v Speaker 2>there are young people who do kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ton to get drawn in by the stuff.</v>

848
00:42:57.991 --> 00:43:00.530
<v Speaker 2>For Real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of young people,</v>

849
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are extremely uneducated,</v>

850
00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:03.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that is a problem with the </v>

851
00:43:05.511 --> 00:43:06.344
<v Speaker 2>educational system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a problem of kind of teaching </v>

852
00:43:09.801 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 2>relativism and the Sun's Thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

853
00:43:12.321 --> 00:43:12.981
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

854
00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:17.780
<v Speaker 2>there's really no such thing as </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective truth and I think people have,</v>

855
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:20.000
<v Speaker 2>people have been saying for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

856
00:43:20.001 --> 00:43:24.050
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of mindset eventually leads </v>
<v Speaker 2>to embracing Holocaust denial that says,</v>

857
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:24.981
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

858
00:43:24.981 --> 00:43:29.981
<v Speaker 2>who's to say what really happened of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>real truth is really historical truth is</v>

859
00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:34.070
<v Speaker 2>really only just a matter of who gets to</v>
<v Speaker 2>control the narrative,</v>

860
00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.100
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

861
00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.120
<v Speaker 1>That is a big problem because whoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>yells,</v>

862
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just yesterday,</v>

863
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.890
<v Speaker 1>did you see this guy at the trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>rallies screaming about it?</v>

864
00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:44.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't retweet it because I don't want</v>

865
00:43:44.491 --> 00:43:45.324
<v Speaker 1>to amplify these crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet at the same point they've </v>

866
00:43:48.481 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 1>suddenly found a voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

867
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:52.860
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's obviously,</v>

868
00:43:52.861 --> 00:43:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's a Holocaust denier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there you.</v>

869
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.650
<v Speaker 1>What is the connection to trump in this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's,</v>

870
00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:58.410
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

871
00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:03.410
<v Speaker 2>connection to trump is not because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his rhetoric on immigration and not,</v>

872
00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:10.740
<v Speaker 2>not his specific positions so much as </v>
<v Speaker 2>just that kind of level of vehemence and</v>

873
00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.560
<v Speaker 2>the common flake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

874
00:44:16.561 --> 00:44:17.460
<v Speaker 2>and I'm in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

875
00:44:17.461 --> 00:44:21.410
<v Speaker 2>it's true that he didn't say all Mexican</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal immigrants are rapists,</v>

876
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:23.040
<v Speaker 2>but like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

877
00:44:23.041 --> 00:44:24.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these Mexican,</v>

878
00:44:24.211 --> 00:44:26.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico is something as these rapists,</v>

879
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:27.623
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

880
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.863
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it did Sunday message to a lot </v>

881
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:35.560
<v Speaker 2>of people on the kind of genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy,</v>

882
00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:38.170
<v Speaker 2>no fallback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

883
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

884
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.430
<v Speaker 2>parts of the outright that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

885
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy who thinks that way we do.</v>

886
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.780
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think ann coulter is kind of a conduit</v>

887
00:44:48.781 --> 00:44:50.790
<v Speaker 2>there too because she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

888
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:56.180
<v Speaker 2>she's actually engaged for years in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely,</v>

889
00:44:56.281 --> 00:44:58.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

890
00:44:58.980 --> 00:44:59.813
<v Speaker 2>kind of a nasty rhetoric targeting all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of different people and including </v>

891
00:45:05.491 --> 00:45:09.180
<v Speaker 2>immigrants and invitation to come on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show by the way.</v>

892
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:09.871
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

893
00:45:09.871 --> 00:45:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

894
00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 2>she became a big cheerleader for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

895
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:14.681
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

896
00:45:14.681 --> 00:45:15.514
<v Speaker 2>the story that I've heard is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually it's the success of her </v>

897
00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:20.430
<v Speaker 2>anti-immigration book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

898
00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.930
<v Speaker 2>audio Adios America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

899
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:23.783
<v Speaker 2>was what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of drove trump to decide </v>

900
00:45:26.821 --> 00:45:29.520
<v Speaker 2>suddenly to make an aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

901
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:32.430
<v Speaker 2>the biggest show of his campaign because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never really.</v>

902
00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of the interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 2012,</v>

903
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:40.390
<v Speaker 2>he actually criticized Mitt Romney for </v>
<v Speaker 2>being too anti integration,</v>

904
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:45.450
<v Speaker 2>which is funny in a way when people talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about trump,</v>

905
00:45:45.451 --> 00:45:46.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being this and that.</v>

906
00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Ideologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think trump ideological,</v>

907
00:45:49.751 --> 00:45:51.740
<v Speaker 2>he trump is a trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

908
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

909
00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.760
<v Speaker 2>is interested in his own advancement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

910
00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:01.110
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make him not dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

911
00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:04.980
<v Speaker 2>and an ego maniac who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.470
<v Speaker 2>very close to being president of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

913
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:08.304
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how close right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if either one of them went to the trump </v>

914
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:14.323
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>

915
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.610
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's,</v>

916
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.570
<v Speaker 2>he's out for his own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know it.</v>

917
00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:20.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we fully understand what </v>
<v Speaker 2>his motivations are,</v>

918
00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:21.744
<v Speaker 2>which may be all presidents have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I think Hillary is the more </v>

919
00:46:26.101 --> 00:46:29.220
<v Speaker 2>conventional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>egomaniac political.</v>

920
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.880
<v Speaker 2>My fear with the trump thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

921
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:33.743
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's a white nationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that by any </v>

922
00:46:36.031 --> 00:46:36.864
<v Speaker 2>estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's allowed for it to </v>

923
00:46:39.001 --> 00:46:41.160
<v Speaker 2>suddenly become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of okay,</v>

924
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:43.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I like you.</v>

925
00:46:43.471 --> 00:46:44.304
<v Speaker 2>I'm a free speech absolutist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as long as these people aren't </v>

926
00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.773
<v Speaker 2>calling to harm for letting them be out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and I'm not for banning any of </v>

927
00:46:50.731 --> 00:46:51.564
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like I'm not for banning Milo from </v>

928
00:46:52.441 --> 00:46:53.274
<v Speaker 2>twitter and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I fear at some level that we're </v>

929
00:46:56.371 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 2>normalizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

930
00:46:58.321 --> 00:46:59.154
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a problem and I think </v>

931
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:05.110
<v Speaker 2>that is really why I felt that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>important to,</v>

932
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:09.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to address this and I have.</v>

933
00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:11.250
<v Speaker 2>And I really do have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

934
00:47:11.251 --> 00:47:16.251
<v Speaker 2>I think Milo was a very smart guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>has done some great things and you know,</v>

935
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:21.660
<v Speaker 2>criticizing and mocking the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice warriors.</v>

936
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a really,</v>

937
00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:28.830
<v Speaker 2>really big mistake for him to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially normalizing and legitimizing</v>

938
00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

939
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kind of creepy or uh,</v>

940
00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>segments of the outright,</v>

941
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:35.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

942
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen them turn on him lately?</v>

943
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:42.271
<v Speaker 2>Because I've seen Nazis show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much of that is theater,</v>

944
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

945
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many of these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

946
00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:50.194
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never actually get out of the </v>

947
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

948
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

949
00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.260
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably.</v>

950
00:47:57.261 --> 00:47:58.094
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

951
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:59.223
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of what goes on while the </v>

952
00:48:00.761 --> 00:48:02.260
<v Speaker 2>outright as theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

953
00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:03.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten threatening tweets and </v>

954
00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:08.770
<v Speaker 2>messages from these people that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really take seriously.</v>

955
00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

956
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:13.083
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of that as really just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of showing off and kind of being </v>

957
00:48:18.131 --> 00:48:19.960
<v Speaker 2>assholes on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

958
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.600
<v Speaker 2>so the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

959
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.790
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a lot of this very violent</v>

960
00:48:24.791 --> 00:48:25.624
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never know when it's going to </v>

961
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.730
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

962
00:48:31.731 --> 00:48:32.564
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trickled down to the wrong person who </v>

963
00:48:34.631 --> 00:48:39.430
<v Speaker 2>actually decides to do something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and not just some tweets and so on.</v>

964
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:40.503
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not going to say that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of not dangerous because when you </v>

965
00:48:43.961 --> 00:48:44.794
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of this rhetoric that </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonizes people that calls for </v>

966
00:48:48.881 --> 00:48:50.310
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

967
00:48:50.311 --> 00:48:54.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of rhetoric come </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling for,</v>

968
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>retaliation against enemies of trump.</v>

969
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.650
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

970
00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the,</v>

971
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:07.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rhetorical atmosphere,</v>

972
00:49:07.331 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 2>the rhetorical climate right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

973
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:11.224
<v Speaker 2>is really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course I'm not going to blame </v>

974
00:49:13.031 --> 00:49:14.620
<v Speaker 2>that entirely on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

975
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:15.830
<v Speaker 2>this may be a good moment.</v>

976
00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:20.500
<v Speaker 1>So that's a segue to the regressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly where I wanted to go with</v>

977
00:49:20.501 --> 00:49:21.334
<v Speaker 1>that because my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I've been somewhat </v>

978
00:49:22.451 --> 00:49:25.540
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic to whatever the alt right </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

979
00:49:25.541 --> 00:49:26.374
<v Speaker 1>is that I do see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not defending the white </v>

980
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:30.580
<v Speaker 1>nationalists and for the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

981
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:34.930
<v Speaker 1>but for all of the people that are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit posting and upsetting everybody and</v>

982
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:35.764
<v Speaker 1>are and are sending memes all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and trying to be heard and all </v>

983
00:49:38.411 --> 00:49:40.540
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're angry at the establishment,</v>

984
00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:41.374
<v Speaker 1>which I fully understand and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry at political correctness and who </v>

985
00:49:44.111 --> 00:49:46.420
<v Speaker 1>did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To them it was the regressive left,</v>

986
00:49:46.421 --> 00:49:47.254
<v Speaker 1>it was the people on the left that </v>
<v Speaker 1>silenced everybody with these false </v>

987
00:49:49.991 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 1>cries of racism and they're a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

988
00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I've been sort of what</v>

989
00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:57.403
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood kind of chaotic reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real argument that I remember actually </v>

990
00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:03.813
<v Speaker 2>arguing with my low back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 40 abroad does articles that were </v>

991
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.083
<v Speaker 2>kind of serious way when he was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of starting to kind of dabble and </v>

992
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize for the alt right.</v>

993
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.150
<v Speaker 2>And he was basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

994
00:50:20.151 --> 00:50:21.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see what,</v>

995
00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:22.323
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on here as that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to challenge these taboos say </v>

996
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.433
<v Speaker 2>because a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the racist label is constantly </v>

997
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:32.210
<v Speaker 2>being used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The silence conservatives,</v>

998
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.253
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually trying to kind of make </v>

999
00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:36.824
<v Speaker 2>that stigma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning meaningless by actually saying </v>

1000
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:46.380
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't really work that way first </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all bought.</v>

1001
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 2>But by doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1002
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:49.813
<v Speaker 2>because I do think that the vast </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of people who are not social </v>

1003
00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:54.254
<v Speaker 2>justice warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are not the regressive left a </v>

1004
00:50:56.601 --> 00:51:01.601
<v Speaker 2>nonetheless quite rightly low the and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1005
00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.490
<v Speaker 2>detest genuine racism and bigotry.</v>

1006
00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:05.643
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing by saying all this </v>

1007
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.410
<v Speaker 2>crap is alienating people who could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be,</v>

1008
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:15.290
<v Speaker 2>it could be your allies because you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're gonna look at you and say,</v>

1009
00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:15.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1010
00:51:15.951 --> 00:51:18.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people really are racist crepes.</v>

1011
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:20.181
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

1012
00:51:20.181 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 2>We don't really want anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1013
00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1014
00:51:23.211 --> 00:51:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really a little bit like a,</v>

1015
00:51:26.841 --> 00:51:27.674
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a black person who wants </v>

1016
00:51:30.141 --> 00:51:33.890
<v Speaker 2>to challenge negative stereotypes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocks,</v>

1017
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:36.210
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna do that by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1018
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.930
<v Speaker 2>trying to embody the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1019
00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:39.861
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1020
00:51:39.861 --> 00:51:42.960
<v Speaker 2>I suppose the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some people in the yellow,</v>

1021
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.430
<v Speaker 2>the rap community who kind of do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that stupid,</v>

1022
00:51:46.431 --> 00:51:47.264
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1023
00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.280
<v Speaker 2>it's stupid when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1024
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:53.220
<v Speaker 2>when anti pc people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1025
00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:54.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1026
00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.500
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I totally agree that the,</v>

1027
00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:01.430
<v Speaker 2>the left bears a lot of responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the climate of uh,</v>

1028
00:52:01.431 --> 00:52:01.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1029
00:52:01.921 --> 00:52:02.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the really,</v>

1030
00:52:02.931 --> 00:52:05.240
<v Speaker 2>really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1031
00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.153
<v Speaker 2>and counterproductive rhetorical climate</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have a uncouple some of that </v>

1032
00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:12.290
<v Speaker 2>from left because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1033
00:52:12.291 --> 00:52:13.124
<v Speaker 2>that's why I've spent so much time </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this show is that I want </v>

1034
00:52:16.191 --> 00:52:21.191
<v Speaker 2>liberalism to turn to logic and reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not always demonizing everybody.</v>

1035
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:22.543
<v Speaker 2>How do I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said almost too late because we </v>

1036
00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:29.981
<v Speaker 2>now see whether side gaining power and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that much more scared of the people that</v>

1037
00:52:30.231 --> 00:52:32.370
<v Speaker 2>are stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1038
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's too late.</v>

1039
00:52:34.461 --> 00:52:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're at the point yet.</v>

1040
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:38.054
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not in the Soviet Union were not </v>

1041
00:52:39.741 --> 00:52:42.830
<v Speaker 2>at the point where you can go to prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1042
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:44.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong thing.</v>

1043
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:48.320
<v Speaker 2>But you do see the findings of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we do see the underpinnings of that.</v>

1044
00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1045
00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:53.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine liberals.</v>

1046
00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:58.800
<v Speaker 2>What I would love to see by the way is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of liberal conservative alliance of</v>

1047
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.080
<v Speaker 2>reasonable people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think right now that is feasible.</v>

1048
00:53:03.081 --> 00:53:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I think we're seeing a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing people like,</v>

1049
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan chait on the liberal side of,</v>

1050
00:53:10.401 --> 00:53:11.234
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking out against political </v>

1051
00:53:12.621 --> 00:53:15.960
<v Speaker 2>correctness and getting attacked by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>regressive love.</v>

1052
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:17.840
<v Speaker 2>And as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1053
00:53:17.841 --> 00:53:20.120
<v Speaker 2>the attacks are really always the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1054
00:53:20.121 --> 00:53:20.751
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1055
00:53:20.751 --> 00:53:21.584
<v Speaker 2>like you're just another white male who </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like women and minorities </v>

1056
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:25.883
<v Speaker 2>criticizing you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the only thing worse than a white </v>

1057
00:53:28.351 --> 00:53:29.184
<v Speaker 2>male who doesn't think the way he spoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>was because actually if you look at the </v>

1058
00:53:33.301 --> 00:53:34.134
<v Speaker 2>article that Jonathan Shade got a talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about criticism directed </v>

1059
00:53:38.671 --> 00:53:39.504
<v Speaker 2>at himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was actually talking mainly about </v>

1060
00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:42.084
<v Speaker 2>women in minorities who were getting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>toxin really nasty ways for being </v>

1061
00:53:45.661 --> 00:53:47.930
<v Speaker 2>politically incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1062
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:48.833
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about people like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim student at the University of </v>

1063
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Michigan who got really badly harassed </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1064
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:55.734
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing something that mark political </v>

1065
00:53:57.001 --> 00:53:57.960
<v Speaker 2>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1066
00:53:57.961 --> 00:53:58.794
<v Speaker 2>I think he had like a bunch of really </v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty leaflets dropped in front of the </v>

1067
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.350
<v Speaker 2>door of his apartment and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1068
00:54:04.351 --> 00:54:04.820
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1069
00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:08.130
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even just people tweeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty things and so on.</v>

1070
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:08.963
<v Speaker 2>It was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way kind of quotes I physical </v>

1071
00:54:11.221 --> 00:54:12.170
<v Speaker 2>harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1072
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:15.470
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there is a um,</v>

1073
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.333
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a movement of both </v>

1074
00:54:18.661 --> 00:54:23.661
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and liberals who are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very ready to reject this and to kind of</v>

1075
00:54:25.681 --> 00:54:28.650
<v Speaker 2>try to restore rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I would love to see,</v>

1076
00:54:28.651 --> 00:54:30.460
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is kind of my,</v>

1077
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.633
<v Speaker 2>my own personal dream right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a single publication like I </v>

1078
00:54:35.641 --> 00:54:36.474
<v Speaker 2>read a lot of publications online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there was a single </v>

1079
00:54:39.121 --> 00:54:39.954
<v Speaker 2>publication that could have consistently</v>
<v Speaker 2>stands up for a non sort of social </v>

1080
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:48.040
<v Speaker 2>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I put this,</v>

1081
00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:50.670
<v Speaker 2>the word social justice in quotation </v>
<v Speaker 2>marks because,</v>

1082
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:51.760
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1083
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.613
<v Speaker 2>it really is a kind of what passes for </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice today is neil to tell </v>

1084
00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:01.290
<v Speaker 2>attarian cult really is obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling words and thoughts.</v>

1085
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:02.183
<v Speaker 2>It's obsessed with identity politics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obsessed with politicizing every </v>

1086
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:08.040
<v Speaker 2>single aspect of life.</v>

1087
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1088
00:55:10.081 --> 00:55:13.650
<v Speaker 2>the discussions of culture like movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's movies,</v>

1089
00:55:13.651 --> 00:55:15.470
<v Speaker 2>video games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1090
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:16.403
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in the progressive media </v>

1091
00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.640
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1092
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:21.623
<v Speaker 2>vice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bridge to some extent of in the daily </v>

1093
00:55:24.571 --> 00:55:25.920
<v Speaker 2>beast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've written for in,</v>

1094
00:55:25.921 --> 00:55:29.250
<v Speaker 2>which I think does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the daily beast is one of the few</v>

1095
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:33.320
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't kind of completely cooptive</v>
<v Speaker 2>by this and still publishes,</v>

1096
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good stuff.</v>

1097
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.260
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1098
00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:37.183
<v Speaker 2>he or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that doesn't fit that kind of </v>

1099
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:42.720
<v Speaker 2>identity politics mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of that,</v>

1100
00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:44.900
<v Speaker 2>like all of the discussion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

1101
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:48.030
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's completely in terms of,</v>

1102
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:49.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1103
00:55:49.051 --> 00:55:51.750
<v Speaker 2>well does this really rough luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1104
00:55:51.751 --> 00:55:55.590
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the true diversity of the population.</v>

1105
00:55:55.591 --> 00:55:55.951
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1106
00:55:55.951 --> 00:56:00.951
<v Speaker 2>do we have enough trans people and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is this cultural appropriation.</v>

1107
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:03.354
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where does this writer really have the </v>

1108
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:10.341
<v Speaker 2>right to talk about this ethnic group </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that he or she does and it's all</v>

1109
00:56:11.851 --> 00:56:15.930
<v Speaker 2>in terms of this ideology and identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's ridiculous.</v>

1110
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:17.840
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think what we,</v>

1111
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:18.713
<v Speaker 2>what I would love to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's that and there's the </v>

1112
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:21.503
<v Speaker 2>conservative media on the other hand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there isn't a single publication </v>

1113
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 2>that could have consistently embraces a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1114
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:35.590
<v Speaker 2>kind of true liberal point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are still some publications</v>

1115
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.673
<v Speaker 2>are likely Atlantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the daily based that have that point of </v>

1116
00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:44.500
<v Speaker 2>view represented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it coexists with a lot of the really</v>

1117
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:47.800
<v Speaker 2>hardcore kind of ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1118
00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Neela to talent tell Ryan as I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>call it.</v>

1119
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:52.833
<v Speaker 2>And I think what that coexistence very </v>
<v Speaker 2>often tends to lead to the liberal </v>

1120
00:56:58.151 --> 00:57:03.151
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint being pushed out because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social justice people,</v>

1121
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 2>they're really not interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue.</v>

1122
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:08.830
<v Speaker 2>They think that the opposing viewpoint </v>
<v Speaker 2>as evil.</v>

1123
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's a little bit like a,</v>

1124
00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:17.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't really have a dialogue between</v>

1125
00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:22.080
<v Speaker 2>voltaire on Torquemada was volunteering </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing burned at the stake.</v>

1126
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:31.300
<v Speaker 2>And so I think trend what we really need</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would love to see this,</v>

1127
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:33.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1128
00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.190
<v Speaker 2>like the old new or a public for </v>
<v Speaker 2>instance.</v>

1129
00:57:36.191 --> 00:57:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean the new new republic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is this,</v>

1130
00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lamentable,</v>

1131
00:57:42.281 --> 00:57:43.114
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shadow of its former self were avoided </v>

1132
00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.353
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw the other day </v>

1133
00:57:46.301 --> 00:57:47.134
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had this really bizarre essay </v>

1134
00:57:50.851 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 2>called what are white writers for or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1135
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.900
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it contained this line,</v>

1136
00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:01.750
<v Speaker 2>which I actually screenshot it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter that said something like,</v>

1137
00:58:01.751 --> 00:58:02.584
<v Speaker 2>well for the most part white people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>always been able to do everything they </v>

1138
00:58:06.281 --> 00:58:11.140
<v Speaker 2>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is detached from reality.</v>

1139
00:58:11.141 --> 00:58:11.974
<v Speaker 2>I mean really seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like these people don't even </v>

1140
00:58:14.351 --> 00:58:18.640
<v Speaker 2>realize how profoundly elitist because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they think.</v>

1141
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:20.830
<v Speaker 2>And the guy who wrote this as a Yale </v>
<v Speaker 2>Grad,</v>

1142
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:21.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you think that your experience as a </v>

1143
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:29.290
<v Speaker 2>writer who went to Yale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because your wife is identical to the</v>

1144
00:58:29.291 --> 00:58:34.280
<v Speaker 2>experience of some white guy who lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Kentucky and as good of a job.</v>

1145
00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.160
<v Speaker 2>But it was going to vote for trump by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

1146
00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:38.740
<v Speaker 2>because you people keep telling him </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1147
00:58:38.741 --> 00:58:39.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is a racist because he is not happy </v>

1148
00:58:41.921 --> 00:58:45.900
<v Speaker 2>with where he is in life and he knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1149
00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think we really,</v>

1150
00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:53.490
<v Speaker 2>really need more voices for this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalism that doesn't,</v>

1151
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:57.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both moderate conservatism,</v>

1152
00:58:57.731 --> 00:58:59.310
<v Speaker 2>which I think has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1153
00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:01.580
<v Speaker 2>largely edge down these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1154
00:59:01.581 --> 00:59:02.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rush limbaughs.</v>

1155
00:59:02.861 --> 00:59:06.590
<v Speaker 2>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1156
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:07.923
<v Speaker 2>national review I think still has some </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good kind of a national review </v>

1157
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:13.420
<v Speaker 2>commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1158
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:14.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1159
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:18.460
<v Speaker 2>those publications have some really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of traditional conservative voices.</v>

1160
00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:20.913
<v Speaker 2>But I think we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really need more of that and we're </v>

1161
00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:27.920
<v Speaker 2>needed more liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a liberal will publications,</v>

1162
00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that consistently advanced</v>

1163
00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:32.910
<v Speaker 1>a liberal law point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1164
00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:33.813
<v Speaker 1>I really liked what you said about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new thing for me because I've been </v>

1165
00:59:36.881 --> 00:59:37.714
<v Speaker 1>sort of talking about a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a few guests that have </v>

1166
00:59:39.191 --> 00:59:40.024
<v Speaker 1>mentioned it and I've been saying for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile that it seems to me that </v>

1167
00:59:41.861 --> 00:59:46.180
<v Speaker 1>defending my liberal values is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a conservative position.</v>

1168
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:48.850
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make me feel good to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1169
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:49.723
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that shows that there's a </v>

1170
00:59:50.651 --> 00:59:52.810
<v Speaker 1>bridge to be built here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to back up to something else that</v>

1171
00:59:52.811 --> 00:59:53.644
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that everything's being </v>

1172
00:59:54.191 --> 00:59:55.024
<v Speaker 1>politicized these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because yesterday I saw on twitter </v>

1173
00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:01.360
<v Speaker 1>somebody tweeted that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lead actress in the show,</v>

1174
01:00:01.361 --> 01:00:02.840
<v Speaker 1>blackish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1175
01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.350
<v Speaker 1>which has doubled the ratings I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

1176
01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:07.270
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Tim Allen's newer show.</v>

1177
01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Not home improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that's on now.</v>

1178
01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:10.683
<v Speaker 1>And it said that he makes something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 times more than him and what the </v>

1179
01:00:14.021 --> 01:00:14.854
<v Speaker 1>implication was with somehow that he as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a white man is making more than this </v>

1180
01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:22.000
<v Speaker 1>black woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that line in general is just</v>

1181
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>a misguided way of attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was really.</v>

1182
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.540
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to solve some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social injustice,</v>

1183
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>but really Tim Allen is a massive star </v>
<v Speaker 1>who I think,</v>

1184
01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been around for name.</v>

1185
01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.093
<v Speaker 1>He's the only person ever to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number one movie number one book and </v>

1186
01:00:38.171 --> 01:00:41.470
<v Speaker 1>number one second of all at the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all the same week.</v>

1187
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.393
<v Speaker 1>So this is a massive star who's reaping </v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of being the headline guy </v>

1188
01:00:45.611 --> 01:00:46.444
<v Speaker 1>in a sycamore.</v>

1189
01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Oprah Winfrey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>

1190
01:00:48.261 --> 01:00:50.530
<v Speaker 2>makes a lot more money than you do.</v>

1191
01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure how the Youtube CPM work out.</v>

1192
01:00:56.921 --> 01:00:59.140
<v Speaker 1>But yes she does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a white guy.</v>

1193
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that prove?</v>

1194
01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1195
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:04.570
<v Speaker 1>but that idea that everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicized,</v>

1196
01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really dangerous,</v>

1197
01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:07.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As someone that comes from absolute,</v>

1198
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>everything was political.</v>

1199
01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1200
01:01:10.221 --> 01:01:11.160
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1201
01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:15.620
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really discouraging to me to see,</v>

1202
01:01:15.621 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 2>especially a lot of the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism,</v>

1203
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:22.310
<v Speaker 2>a couch completely in these political </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms.</v>

1204
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1205
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:24.734
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can read a random review of some TV </v>

1206
01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:33.410
<v Speaker 2>show and suddenly you see a lot in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long the lines of,</v>

1207
01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1208
01:01:34.611 --> 01:01:35.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1209
01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.660
<v Speaker 2>in the rape culture of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1210
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:40.920
<v Speaker 2>modern American society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

1211
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.650
<v Speaker 2>women are systematically suppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1212
01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:46.370
<v Speaker 2>cannot express their wishes freely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1213
01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

1214
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:52.820
<v Speaker 2>it reminds me of how when I was growing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the Soviet Union,</v>

1215
01:01:52.821 --> 01:01:54.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to that experience,</v>

1216
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I had these additions of classics like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare in translation and there was</v>

1217
01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:05.291
<v Speaker 2>a kind of obligatory thing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually any publication of,</v>

1218
01:02:07.401 --> 01:02:08.234
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a classic had to have a forward that </v>

1219
01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:14.653
<v Speaker 2>had to have at least some passages that </v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in the proper kind of Marxist </v>

1220
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:18.853
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

1221
01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.253
<v Speaker 2>A warning before trigger will trigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>warning so much as kind of an </v>

1222
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:27.630
<v Speaker 2>ideological framework that told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1223
01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.430
<v Speaker 2>what the correct weight are we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

1224
01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:30.750
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1225
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:35.751
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare's King Lear is really about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the emergence of the bourgeoisie and its</v>

1226
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.660
<v Speaker 2>replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1227
01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:40.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feudal family system.</v>

1228
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:44.440
<v Speaker 2>So on and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it really has,</v>

1229
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:45.283
<v Speaker 2>and there would be a quote from either </v>
<v Speaker 2>mark's or London and it was funny </v>

1230
01:02:48.451 --> 01:02:49.284
<v Speaker 2>because apparently in the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>publishing industry I've heard people </v>

1231
01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:57.750
<v Speaker 2>actually used to refer to these Marx and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lenin quotes as locomotives because they</v>

1232
01:02:57.751 --> 01:03:00.480
<v Speaker 2>were like pulling the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw the publication of the book,</v>

1233
01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:01.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you couldn't get the book published </v>

1234
01:03:03.031 --> 01:03:04.230
<v Speaker 2>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1235
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:07.650
<v Speaker 2>and it's not necessarily the person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote the foreword believed any of that.</v>

1236
01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:08.484
<v Speaker 2>I will just this obligatory nod to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reigning ideology and I think we're </v>

1237
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:14.334
<v Speaker 2>almost getting to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at a lot of TV movie book reviews </v>

1238
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.160
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1239
01:03:20.161 --> 01:03:20.994
<v Speaker 2>kind of progressive left of center </v>
<v Speaker 2>publications and it's the same kind of </v>

1240
01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:24.871
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1241
01:03:24.871 --> 01:03:26.730
<v Speaker 2>you see these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1242
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:30.240
<v Speaker 2>references to the race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender,</v>

1243
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality,</v>

1244
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:33.780
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

1245
01:03:33.781 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a that permeates everything.</v>

1246
01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:39.720
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's scary,</v>

1247
01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.513
<v Speaker 2>especially in terms of gender and gender</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues and relations between men and </v>

1248
01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:46.930
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1249
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:49.230
<v Speaker 2>we haven't even gotten to the thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1250
01:03:49.231 --> 01:03:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing a lot of writing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender.</v>

1251
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're out of time.</v>

1252
01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.690
<v Speaker 1>So you absolutely are going to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1253
01:03:56.691 --> 01:03:58.790
<v Speaker 1>whether you like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not forcing you to come back,</v>

1254
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>do time next time we're going to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full hour of gender issues,</v>

1255
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:05.090
<v Speaker 1>do all the gender is feminism and men </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and all that.</v>

1256
01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:05.924
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do love how you brought this </v>

1257
01:04:06.741 --> 01:04:07.574
<v Speaker 1>back to where we started because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>themes of being in a society that are </v>

1258
01:04:10.701 --> 01:04:11.534
<v Speaker 1>closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in an open one now and someone </v>

1259
01:04:13.671 --> 01:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>like you that's lived through the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side can,</v>

1260
01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:19.280
<v Speaker 1>can see some of the frameworks of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening here.</v>

1261
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I'm glad that we brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>her in.</v>

1262
01:04:20.951 --> 01:04:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you the last word.</v>

1263
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:23.191
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1264
01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:24.160
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1265
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.013
<v Speaker 2>he made a really good point about how we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an open society that as suddenly </v>

1266
01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:30.204
<v Speaker 2>somehow reproducing a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought patterns of closed society is a </v>

1267
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:38.880
<v Speaker 2>society is where there is a dominant </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>

1268
01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:42.720
<v Speaker 2>And I think that is something that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>all have to be very,</v>

1269
01:04:42.721 --> 01:04:44.580
<v Speaker 2>very leery of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1270
01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1271
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:51.630
<v Speaker 2>the saying the world exclusively through</v>
<v Speaker 2>a political slash ideological lens,</v>

1272
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a really,</v>

1273
01:04:54.421 --> 01:04:55.254
<v Speaker 2>really limited and skewed way of looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the world and it also really keeps </v>

1274
01:05:01.441 --> 01:05:04.140
<v Speaker 2>you from looking at the opposing point </v>
<v Speaker 2>of view because,</v>

1275
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:05.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1276
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.810
<v Speaker 2>if a point of view that is different </v>
<v Speaker 2>from yours is not just a different point</v>

1277
01:05:09.811 --> 01:05:11.550
<v Speaker 2>of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the enemy,</v>

1278
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.051
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1279
01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:16.170
<v Speaker 2>that is really not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1280
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:17.083
<v Speaker 2>that is really not very conducive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a full picture of what's going </v>

1281
01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:23.200
<v Speaker 2>on in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that applies by the way,</v>

1282
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:24.034
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a lot of people on the right as well </v>

1283
01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:27.550
<v Speaker 2>as people in the love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1284
01:05:27.551 --> 01:05:30.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right kind of has its own version of</v>

1285
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:31.030
<v Speaker 2>political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

1286
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defending the right.</v>

1287
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:34.923
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1288
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1289
01:05:37.171 --> 01:05:38.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we,</v>

1290
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:38.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1291
01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:43.590
<v Speaker 2>and I'm gonna repeat it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to add my own politics.</v>

1292
01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:48.640
<v Speaker 2>Quite a moderate libertarian really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not extremely doctrinaire about,</v>

1293
01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:50.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimal government.</v>

1294
01:05:50.761 --> 01:05:51.594
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I obviously think less government is </v>

1295
01:05:53.431 --> 01:05:54.630
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1296
01:05:54.631 --> 01:05:55.464
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably not quite as a minimalistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>about government or some of my </v>

1297
01:05:59.611 --> 01:06:01.020
<v Speaker 2>colleagues that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1298
01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:01.531
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1299
01:06:01.531 --> 01:06:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreements that we can have about,</v>

1300
01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:06.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the size of government,</v>

1301
01:06:06.301 --> 01:06:07.134
<v Speaker 2>about welfare programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are all legitimate subject for </v>

1302
01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.250
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1303
01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.980
<v Speaker 2>as long as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1304
01:06:13.981 --> 01:06:17.430
<v Speaker 2>you understand that your point of view </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be wrong,</v>

1305
01:06:17.431 --> 01:06:18.264
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're not necessarily write about </v>

1306
01:06:19.501 --> 01:06:21.440
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1307
01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:22.283
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately the identity politics are </v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole different ballgame because </v>

1308
01:06:25.591 --> 01:06:29.580
<v Speaker 2>unlike the debates about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the welfare state,</v>

1309
01:06:29.581 --> 01:06:32.010
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity politics,</v>

1310
01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:34.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does turn to put people in boxes.</v>

1311
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Identity politics tends to demonize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition.</v>

1312
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:40.470
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1313
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:41.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1314
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:43.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social justice ideology,</v>

1315
01:06:43.741 --> 01:06:44.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1316
01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:45.563
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really kind of seeks to control how </v>

1317
01:06:47.791 --> 01:06:50.730
<v Speaker 2>people even talk about identity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>related issues.</v>

1318
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:54.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's a whole difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a whole different story.</v>

1319
01:06:54.271 --> 01:06:56.070
<v Speaker 2>And this is where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1320
01:06:56.071 --> 01:06:56.904
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's really possible to </v>

1321
01:06:57.991 --> 01:07:02.991
<v Speaker 2>conduct a dialogue with people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>espouse to Terry and ideology.</v>

1322
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you absolutely,</v>

1323
01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you're coming back where we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get interested in as I last,</v>

1324
01:07:08.671 --> 01:07:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I like to say on a good interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even look at these ones.</v>

1325
01:07:10.751 --> 01:07:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't pick them up once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a pleasure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to do this again.</v>

1328

<v Speaker 1>we're real people in more than 140 </v>

1329
01:07:20.201 --> 01:07:21.190
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>
