1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.473
<v Speaker 1>I truly don't know if I could've come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a more perfect guest for the first </v>

2
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>episode of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris is a neuroscientist,</v>

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>author and founder of project reason and</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to some people,</v>

4
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>he's also a genocidal maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bent on nuking,</v>

5
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>much of the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

6
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

8
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>which half of that would you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>describes you better?</v>

9
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about both halves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine.</v>

10
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take the first though.</v>

11
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really thrilled that you're here and</v>

12
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:28.441
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.274
<v Speaker 1>you came in for my first show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said you were going to come in and </v>

14
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.130
<v Speaker 1>October when your book comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I twisted your arm sufficiently and,</v>

15
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>and here you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Well congratulations on the show too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

17
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

18
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.340
<v Speaker 1>so let's start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to start basically were sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really found out about you and where I</v>

20
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>think this whole discussion that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

21
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.653
<v Speaker 1>everyone's been having for the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight months or so started and you were </v>

22
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>on real time with Bill Maher and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were on to talk about your book.</v>

23
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Bill was talking about liberalism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam and Ben Affleck was on,</v>

24
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 1>and I know everyone's seen this clip </v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

25
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>but let's take a look when</v>

26
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.393
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk about the treatment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>women and homosexuals and free thinkers </v>

27
00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:07.204
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and public intellectuals in the Muslim </v>

28
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:09.154
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that the liberals have </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed us and the crucial point</v>

30
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.233
<v Speaker 3>confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

31
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God you're here.</v>

32
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 3>The crucial point of confusion</v>

33
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.893
<v Speaker 2>and is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have been sold this meme of </v>

34
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:23.374
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia where every criticism of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the doctrine of Islam gets conflated </v>

35
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 2>with bigotry toward Muslims as people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

36
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.293
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

37
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.540
<v Speaker 3>intellectually ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even if it gets cold,</v>

38
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.413
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the person who understands the </v>

39
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:40.420
<v Speaker 2>officially codified doctrine of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

40
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.263
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually well educated on this </v>

41
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 2>topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking you if I criticize the,</v>

42
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 2>you're saying that Islamophobia is not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real thing,</v>

43
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.800
<v Speaker 2>that if you're critical of something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a real thing when we do it.</v>

44
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

45
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

46
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.843
<v Speaker 2>I'm not denying that that certain people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are bigoted against Muslims as people </v>

47
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 2>and that's a problem big have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the gross,</v>

48
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 2>it's racist and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

49
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:06.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like saying nine years shifted,</v>

50
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.753
<v Speaker 2>you know what we are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are saying if you want to be </v>

51
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 2>liberals believe in liberal principles </v>
<v Speaker 2>of freedom of speech.</v>

52
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are endowed by our forefathers of the</v>

53
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all men are created.</v>

54
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.693
<v Speaker 2>No Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to be able to criticize bad </v>

55
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

56
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 1>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's gross.</v>

57
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:23.510
<v Speaker 1>It's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should be your twitter bio.</v>

58
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:24.344
<v Speaker 1>Have you considered putting it there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been just throwing that at </v>

59
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>me on twitter ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

61
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit of a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.493
<v Speaker 1>So what I want to start with is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's obviously a ton </v>

63
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:33.344
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about the fallout of this </v>

64
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:34.814
<v Speaker 1>and we'll get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to talk about actually the </v>

65
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>specifics of what happened there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you expect.</v>

66
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:39.794
<v Speaker 1>Because usually when they bring on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guests that sits on bill's side of the </v>

67
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:42.494
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually it's for a one on one with bill </v>

68
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 1>and sort of a casual conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The panel doesn't really jump in.</v>

69
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Did you expect that whole thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explode the way that it did?</v>

70
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:50.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

71
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.433
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was selling a book on meditation at </v>

72
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>that moment I was talking and the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

73
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 1>that's about 60 seconds into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange.</v>

74
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so initially</v>

75
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 2>it starts with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

76
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 2>how can an atheist be spiritual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a.</v>

77
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 2>we're talking along those lines and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said something slightly derogatory about</v>

78
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.800
<v Speaker 2>the new age and Ben jumped into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>space and,</v>

79
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.853
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was at my throat about Islam hadn't </v>

80
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>even come up so he clearly was poised to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that and yeah,</v>

81
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.824
<v Speaker 2>it's considered a protected interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone on the panel knows they're not </v>

82
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 2>supposed to jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think was going on with Ben?</v>

83
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.743
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from him possibly being on </v>

84
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 2>steroids for his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

85
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.200
<v Speaker 2>his Batman role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

86
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think he clearly had he,</v>

87
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.813
<v Speaker 2>I think he had no idea who I was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone had given him a paragraph </v>

88
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>bio of me and had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had more or less told him that,</v>

89
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

90
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 2>a bigot who's intolerant of Muslims and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.020
<v Speaker 2>he really should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

92
00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 2>take a whack at me on that topic.</v>

93
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And honestly,</v>

94
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.703
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was a little slow to </v>

95
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 2>appreciate how hostile he was because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't just looking at him.</v>

96
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.104
<v Speaker 2>I was actually looking at Nick Kristoff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I have actually collided with on </v>

97
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>this topic and who my remarks were more </v>
<v Speaker 2>pitched to,</v>

98
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 2>I think more appropriately pitched </v>
<v Speaker 2>because nick really deals with,</v>

99
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.770
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

100
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 2>especially women's rights issues in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing world to a unique degree.</v>

101
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 2>So I had a bit of a bone to pick with </v>
<v Speaker 2>nick and um,</v>

102
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.163
<v Speaker 2>and there were other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Steele was on the panel and so </v>

103
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.103
<v Speaker 2>my attention was split and so I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of out of the corner of my </v>

104
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 2>consciousness was I was understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was a level of hostility here</v>

105
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:33.934
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't really expect or know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to interpret and so talking about </v>

106
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 2>knowing how to interpret it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a little different if,</v>

107
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.893
<v Speaker 2>if Nick Kristoff or some author or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher had immediately jumped out </v>

108
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 2>at you like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think perhaps it would have dealt with</v>

109
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:50.540
<v Speaker 2>it in one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when a big.</v>

110
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is an a list Hollywood star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is Batman jumps at you that way.</v>

111
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Did that throw you off in a way that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

112
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:57.844
<v Speaker 2>you were cool and collected there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just having to deal with someone at </v>

113
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:02.310
<v Speaker 2>that level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different ballgame,</v>

114
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

115
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Well it's hard to interrupt a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

116
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 2>a movie star who doesn't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrupted.</v>

117
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>So at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 2>if bill's not going to cut them off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't cut them off.</v>

119
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 2>So trying to get a word in edgewise is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge there.</v>

120
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the irony is the sentence,</v>

121
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:20.254
<v Speaker 2>he was reacting to the sentence where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>say everyone conflates criticism of </v>

122
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Islam instead of ideas with bigotry </v>
<v Speaker 2>against Muslims as people.</v>

123
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.073
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he no sooner no sooner were those words </v>

124
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:31.924
<v Speaker 2>uttered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he demonstrated my thesis with </v>

125
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 2>every subsequent statement and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just impossible to,</v>

126
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.480
<v Speaker 2>to get that mirror bent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 2>close enough toward his face so that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could recognize what,</v>

128
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.430
<v Speaker 2>what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he literally,</v>

129
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 2>for the remainder of the 12 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

130
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:51.030
<v Speaker 2>he continually go and repeatedly proved </v>
<v Speaker 2>your theory.</v>

131
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Then I continued for an hour in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>green room afterwards and it was,</v>

132
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was by no means resolved.</v>

133
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And clearly hasn't resolved since.</v>

134
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.050
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

135
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to focus too much on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>

136
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>but I just want to talk about when </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone throws,</v>

137
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he throws this,</v>

138
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>it's gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's racist.</v>

139
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly I noticed that the next day the</v>
<v Speaker 1>onus was on you and Bill Maher.</v>

140
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>And a little more to bill I think to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prove that you weren't racist.</v>

141
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I have never been a big fan of bills for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>

142
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anyone call him racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever before,</v>

143
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>but suddenly the next day on all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>websites,</v>

144
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:25.200
<v Speaker 1>it was Ben Affleck Call Sam Harris and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill and my racist is Ben,</v>

145
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>is Bill Maher Racist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Sam Harris Racist?</v>

146
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.753
<v Speaker 1>How does that feel in that moment of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion when someone throws that </v>

147
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>gauntlet down because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

148
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 1>you're used to debate and people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

149
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 1>not just words.</v>

150
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.673
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very dispiriting because it's </v>

151
00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 2>almost guaranteed to convince half the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience happy and this is something.</v>

152
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:48.870
<v Speaker 2>This is the first thing I said to Ben </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards in the green room,</v>

153
00:06:48.871 --> 00:06:52.080
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize just calling us racist,</v>

154
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.333
<v Speaker 2>convinced half the people listening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching that were racist and leaders </v>

155
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.520
<v Speaker 2>are using that word is enough for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

156
00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:02.190
<v Speaker 2>So people just assume where there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke,</v>

157
00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:03.024
<v Speaker 2>there's fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't figure out what anyone is </v>

158
00:07:04.681 --> 00:07:05.514
<v Speaker 2>actually saying that their attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>span is so truncated that using words </v>

159
00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:11.590
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.880
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just convinces fully half the audience.</v>

161
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.773
<v Speaker 2>And the most depressing thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aftermath of this was to see the </v>

162
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.513
<v Speaker 2>outpouring of the celebration of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disproportionally and the Muslim </v>

163
00:07:24.631 --> 00:07:25.464
<v Speaker 2>community on social media from people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who thought that he had just mopped the </v>

164
00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:33.234
<v Speaker 2>floor with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he had exposed our racism for all </v>

165
00:07:35.341 --> 00:07:36.174
<v Speaker 2>to see and he had argued brilliantly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just this white knight for the </v>

166
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Muslim world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was so embarrassing because he,</v>

167
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.170
<v Speaker 2>of course he did none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

168
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.023
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't making any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't listening to what we were </v>

169
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:47.280
<v Speaker 2>actually saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was simply,</v>

170
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

171
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling us names,</v>

172
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.960
<v Speaker 2>know very loaded names and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

173
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.010
<v Speaker 2>it works for people who want to perceive</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation along those lines.</v>

174
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Was there was this meme or this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you as a racist,</v>

175
00:08:03.061 --> 00:08:03.894
<v Speaker 1>was that even out there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because now I see it in a dialogue all </v>

176
00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:07.320
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

177
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.110
<v Speaker 1>but I had never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to be 100 percent honest with you,</v>

178
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I had sort of ancillary knew your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure if I was following you</v>

179
00:08:13.801 --> 00:08:14.634
<v Speaker 1>on twitter at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know a lot of people when they're </v>

180
00:08:16.111 --> 00:08:18.330
<v Speaker 1>done with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have just as Sam Harris</v>

181
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.470
<v Speaker 1>fanboy and blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

182
00:08:19.471 --> 00:08:20.304
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

183
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.570
<v Speaker 1>But I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

184
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I was watching that and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

185
00:08:23.311 --> 00:08:24.144
<v Speaker 1>here's someone making some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Now ben Affleck's just using the </v>

186
00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:27.684
<v Speaker 1>worst kind of language with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But was that idea about you out there </v>

187
00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>

188
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

189
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.901
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

190
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:36.580
<v Speaker 2>I think Glenn Greenwald and a few other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people had put it out there.</v>

191
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

192
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.590
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a trope of,</v>

193
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.843
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political politically correct liberal </v>

194
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:47.960
<v Speaker 2>apology around criticism of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this notion of Islamophobia,</v>

195
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 2>the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to single out Islam for any special</v>

196
00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:57.941
<v Speaker 2>attention as a set of doctrines or as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political in today's world is tantamount</v>

197
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:05.450
<v Speaker 2>to synonymous with or covertly motivated</v>
<v Speaker 2>by racist bigotry toward Arabs are Brown</v>

198
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 2>skinned people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

199
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:10.923
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many people like Glenn </v>

200
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Greenwald who quite irresponsibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 2>make that point again and again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

202
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.870
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

203
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so ben's a started.</v>

204
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 2>That was not the first time criticism of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam has been conflated with racism,</v>

205
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

206
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's such a crazy claim because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

207
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean this has been pointed out again </v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

208
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 2>and bill's done this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Islam is not a race.</v>

209
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a set of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't convert away from a race.</v>

210
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 2>You can't convert to erase Rachel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dolezal.</v>

211
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.920
<v Speaker 2>You can get this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

212
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

213
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.773
<v Speaker 2>A few at one person can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything I say about Islam applies to </v>

214
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:49.554
<v Speaker 2>white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>converts to the faith every bit as much </v>

215
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 2>as it does to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Arabs or,</v>

216
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.190
<v Speaker 2>or anyone born into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

217
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.193
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even more so because that means you've </v>

218
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.563
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're 30 years old and had not had </v>

219
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 2>this drummed into you on mother's knee </v>
<v Speaker 2>and with a full adult,</v>

220
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear viewing of,</v>

221
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 2>of your life and all the opportunities </v>
<v Speaker 2>available to you,</v>

222
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.933
<v Speaker 2>you decide to convert to the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrinaire and repressive form of </v>

223
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:12.864
<v Speaker 2>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then then I have the most to say </v>

224
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 2>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

225
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.540
<v Speaker 2>someone like Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

226
00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Don,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the.</v>

227
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.623
<v Speaker 2>I think he's now dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm the guy from Orange County who </v>

228
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 2>joined al Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

229
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.793
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are so and everything I say about </v>

230
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Islam as a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

231
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:29.994
<v Speaker 2>I've said some disparaging things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it as a set of ideas and I've compared </v>

232
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 2>it unfavorably to Buddhism and Hinduism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

233
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:37.050
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their adherence are,</v>

234
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.033
<v Speaker 2>are for the most part not white like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that racism has the notions </v>

235
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:44.190
<v Speaker 2>of race has anything to do with this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just completely crazy.</v>

236
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I took the top five things that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>people attack you on my opinion,</v>

237
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:51.950
<v Speaker 1>misquote you on and I thought maybe we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could take five minutes for each one,</v>

238
00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:55.880
<v Speaker 1>five or six minutes for each one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way each time someone says,</v>

239
00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:56.714
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris wants to nuke the Middle </v>

240
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.903
<v Speaker 1>East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Sam Harris wants to racially profile </v>

241
00:10:59.751 --> 00:11:00.584
<v Speaker 1>Muslims or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You or I or anyone that's clear-minded </v>

242
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.800
<v Speaker 1>can just send a link and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is in five minutes.</v>

243
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:07.663
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to read a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to watch a three hour </v>

244
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:12.050
<v Speaker 1>interview here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the number one thing that people</v>

245
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.350
<v Speaker 1>say about you is that when you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

246
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>you mean all Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

247
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So take it away.</v>

248
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:20.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

249
00:11:20.241 --> 00:11:21.074
<v Speaker 2>the claim is that I generalize about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims and this is incredibly ironic </v>

250
00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:30.470
<v Speaker 2>because half the time on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that film clip,</v>

251
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.693
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was spent where I was talking about </v>

252
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.323
<v Speaker 2>statistics and poll results and </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentages and a certain percentage is </v>

253
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.450
<v Speaker 2>jihadist and then there's a wider circle</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

254
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.390
<v Speaker 2>of Islamists and then there's a wider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wider circle of conservatives.</v>

255
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.553
<v Speaker 2>And so I never generalize about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim world and in so far as we have </v>

256
00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:50.684
<v Speaker 2>good data on the numbers of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribed various beliefs that I'm </v>

257
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:59.371
<v Speaker 2>always looking at those data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm at everything I say about the</v>

258
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 2>problem of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Islam and Islamism,</v>

259
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes as its area of concern.</v>

260
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:09.424
<v Speaker 2>First and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people living in the Muslim world </v>

261
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:15.370
<v Speaker 2>who are living under the shadow of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

262
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.990
<v Speaker 2>if not the boot of theocracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

263
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 2>women and gays and free thinkers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>public intellectuals and atheists.</v>

264
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 2>People who email me saying they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid their,</v>

265
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 2>their mother and father will kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they knew they were an atheist,</v>

266
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

267
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.043
<v Speaker 2>and there's nobody who I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I celebrate more than Muslim </v>

268
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:36.874
<v Speaker 2>apostates and muzzle and true reformist </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims like my coauthor on this new </v>

269
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.134
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Magenta was who have taken just heroic </v>

270
00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:44.614
<v Speaker 2>risks to say critical things about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith in a context where it's much more </v>

271
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Speaker 2>dangerous to do so then the context and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where were you and I live and I mean,</v>

272
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:53.910
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.640
<v Speaker 2>if I were a Muslim in Pakistan saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>half of what I'm saying on this show,</v>

274
00:12:57.641 --> 00:13:01.700
<v Speaker 2>I would have a life expectancy of about </v>
<v Speaker 2>five hours and that is a,</v>

275
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.583
<v Speaker 2>that is a political and human rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality that every liberal who's using </v>

276
00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:10.960
<v Speaker 2>this term Islamophobia is disregarding </v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

277
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.380
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at their peril,</v>

278
00:13:12.381 --> 00:13:15.730
<v Speaker 2>at the peril of all the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not being helped by,</v>

279
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Westerners who could help,</v>

280
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and non Muslims who could help and what </v>

281
00:13:21.451 --> 00:13:22.284
<v Speaker 2>non Muslims can do is help in whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>way possible to make criticism of </v>

282
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 2>theocracy in the Muslim world.</v>

283
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Safe to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

284
00:13:31.761 --> 00:13:32.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't generalize.</v>

285
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.830
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

286
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.223
<v Speaker 2>of course there are millions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of Muslims who do not take the </v>

287
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.930
<v Speaker 2>barbaric passages in the Quran and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hadith seriously and who are not wanting</v>

288
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 2>to kill apostates and don't and don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to throw gays from rooftops.</v>

289
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 2>And those are not the people I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

290
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:54.574
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if I'm ever talking about them in my </v>

291
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:56.674
<v Speaker 2>criticism of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about them in the same </v>

292
00:13:58.601 --> 00:13:59.860
<v Speaker 2>spirit that I talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

293
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 2>reformed Jews or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or non-doctrinaire Christians who are,</v>

294
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.910
<v Speaker 2>who are not a real threat to anybody who</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who,</v>

295
00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:10.480
<v Speaker 2>or but who may be bending public policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>around in ways we don't like.</v>

296
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.063
<v Speaker 2>The problem with many of those Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>is they don't want their religion </v>

297
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 2>criticized at all and they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>any link between its core tenants.</v>

298
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Could tenants around Jihad and paradise </v>
<v Speaker 2>and martyrdom.</v>

299
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.910
<v Speaker 2>A spelled out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

300
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.620
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.533
<v Speaker 2>in terms of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the way it's generating the kinds </v>

302
00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:37.510
<v Speaker 2>of violence and intolerance where we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing in the world today.</v>

303
00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:38.344
<v Speaker 2>So in so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to defend your religion </v>

304
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:41.044
<v Speaker 2>by saying Islam is a religion of peace </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Islamic state has nothing to do </v>

305
00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:47.980
<v Speaker 2>with Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being intellectually dishonest.</v>

306
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of denial of obvious </v>
<v Speaker 2>realities now is I think,</v>

307
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible and dangerous.</v>

308
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to close the door to notions of </v>

309
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 2>racism and bigotry against Muslims as </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

310
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.420
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the apostates,</v>

311
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 2>the intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women,</v>

312
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.243
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gaze of the Muslim world are the </v>

313
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:11.714
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important people in the world </v>

314
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we,</v>

315
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.950
<v Speaker 2>if we could give green cards to every </v>
<v Speaker 2>real secularist in the Muslim world,</v>

316
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I think they should just get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of the line.</v>

317
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

318
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Speaker 2>these are the people who need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>empowered.</v>

319
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.620
<v Speaker 2>And so that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

320
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 2>the irony is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they could leave the Muslim world,</v>

321
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.380
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim world needs them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

322
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:35.390
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best thing to do would be to empower</v>

323
00:15:35.391 --> 00:15:37.280
<v Speaker 2>them in the Muslim world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But method,</v>

324
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life for these people is,</v>

325
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in countries like Pakistan and Bankman,</v>

326
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.753
<v Speaker 2>we have Bangladeshi blogger is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered in public by machete wielding </v>

327
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:50.210
<v Speaker 2>maniacs and nothing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

328
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

329
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:52.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

330
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:53.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

331
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.153
<v Speaker 2>so my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I say about Islam is a </v>

332
00:15:56.931 --> 00:15:59.150
<v Speaker 2>confession of solidarity with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

333
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 2>And so how you get racism out of that or</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigotry against Muslims as people,</v>

334
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's you.</v>

335
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 2>You're a better geometer than I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

336
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.443
<v Speaker 2>this is a big one and I've seen this one</v>
<v Speaker 2>really take a life of its own that you </v>

337
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:15.680
<v Speaker 2>want to do a nuclear first strike on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim world,</v>

338
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:16.663
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

339
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.713
<v Speaker 2>Is that true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam?</v>

340
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.831
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

341
00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Alas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not true.</v>

342
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

343
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.810
<v Speaker 2>I guess it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was made,</v>

344
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.813
<v Speaker 2>made true apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least to the satisfaction of many </v>

345
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:26.774
<v Speaker 2>people by Chris Hedges who went around </v>
<v Speaker 2>in every stop on his book tour Know </v>

346
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.673
<v Speaker 2>Radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

347
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.790
<v Speaker 2>print telling people that this was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact my position.</v>

348
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and many people like Glenn Greenwald and</v>

349
00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Reza Aslan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

350
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.970
<v Speaker 2>you're a old colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Janky,</v>

351
00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:46.430
<v Speaker 2>eager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

352
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have reiterated this claim.</v>

353
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.760
<v Speaker 2>There are a couple of passages in the my</v>
<v Speaker 2>first book,</v>

354
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:53.594
<v Speaker 2>the end of faith where I talk about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>a certainty about paradise and about </v>

355
00:16:58.521 --> 00:16:59.354
<v Speaker 2>martyrdom is the best way to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just destroys the logic of nuclear </v>

356
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:05.024
<v Speaker 2>deterrence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mutually assured destruction that we </v>

357
00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:07.094
<v Speaker 2>had kept us more or less poised on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brink of a mutual annihilation with the </v>

358
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union for so many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

359
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 2>and I just pointed out what I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>an obvious fact and still isn't obvious.</v>

360
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.093
<v Speaker 2>Facts should be an obvious fact and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very troubling one that if you have a </v>

361
00:17:22.761 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 2>regime that has the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

362
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.290
<v Speaker 2>that is the psychological equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 hijackers,</v>

363
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.133
<v Speaker 2>but people who woke up in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to fly a plane into a building </v>

364
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.560
<v Speaker 2>that is a regime who you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not rational actors,</v>

365
00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:38.600
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if they're rational,</v>

366
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:42.230
<v Speaker 2>it's rational within a context of </v>
<v Speaker 2>believing that they're going to paradise</v>

367
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.460
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

368
00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:44.920
<v Speaker 2>So what's the rational part of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

369
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.173
<v Speaker 2>but it's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you believe that it's rational to </v>

370
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 2>blow up the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

371
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 2>it's rational to hit the wall 400 miles </v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour.</v>

372
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

373
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.263
<v Speaker 2>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I pointed out the obvious fact that </v>

374
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:56.454
<v Speaker 2>we have to avoid the circumstance at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>costs and there's no one who should be </v>

375
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:01.104
<v Speaker 2>more cognizant of this problem then </v>
<v Speaker 2>so-called moderate Muslims or so or </v>

376
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.280
<v Speaker 2>secular Muslims or non jihadist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

377
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.373
<v Speaker 2>Muslims and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to collectively find some path </v>

378
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.243
<v Speaker 2>to a alternative future in which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have a true jihadist regime armed </v>

379
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:23.160
<v Speaker 2>with a long range.</v>

380
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Nuclear Weapons and all of those long </v>
<v Speaker 2>range is,</v>

381
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 2>is crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have Pakistan,</v>

382
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:29.064
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan already has nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I think we should execute a nuclear </v>

383
00:18:31.741 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 2>first strike on packs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan?</v>

384
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:33.984
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Pakistan is not first of all age </v>

385
00:18:35.391 --> 00:18:38.090
<v Speaker 2>hottest regime and though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.100
<v Speaker 2>they're one cool away from being taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>over by one,</v>

387
00:18:41.101 --> 00:18:41.934
<v Speaker 2>but they're also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the warheads that can </v>

388
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:48.530
<v Speaker 2>deliver these nukes to the capitals of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe or to the US.</v>

389
00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very different circumstance.</v>

390
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>

391
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:54.390
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that I say in that book,</v>

392
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:56.790
<v Speaker 2>the suggests that we should be nuking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran,</v>

393
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>

394
00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.633
<v Speaker 2>this is all I was talking about is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of game theoretic logic of </v>

395
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.940
<v Speaker 2>nuclear deterrence that we lived however</v>
<v Speaker 2>precariously under,</v>

396
00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:09.774
<v Speaker 2>with the Soviet Union falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you admit to yourself that it's </v>

397
00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:14.574
<v Speaker 2>possible that truly suicidal religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>maniacs can get their hands on these </v>

398
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 2>weapons.</v>

399
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.900
<v Speaker 2>And so all I was calling for his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

400
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our awareness that is a,</v>

401
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.790
<v Speaker 2>that really is a game changer and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to avoid that at all cost.</v>

402
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

403
00:19:30.891 --> 00:19:33.000
<v Speaker 2>you said this was just a few passages in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your book.</v>

404
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:34.630
<v Speaker 2>It was literally about a page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

405
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like a paragraph or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

406
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people have blown this up into,</v>

407
00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.483
<v Speaker 2>into some something that somehow this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this massive idea that you had </v>

408
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.063
<v Speaker 2>actually a good friend of mine who I </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with that a lot of things and </v>

409
00:19:46.381 --> 00:19:48.170
<v Speaker 2>disagree on some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

410
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.103
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he says to me in relation to this </v>

411
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:55.310
<v Speaker 2>is that you are laying the philosophical</v>
<v Speaker 2>groundwork for a nuclear first strike.</v>

412
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.203
<v Speaker 2>People respond to this passage as though</v>
<v Speaker 2>I invented nuclear weapons or that I </v>

413
00:20:00.481 --> 00:20:01.314
<v Speaker 2>think there are a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about the reality of </v>

414
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:03.450
<v Speaker 2>our world.</v>

415
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.300
<v Speaker 2>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a nuclear policy,</v>

416
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a first strike policy.</v>

417
00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:11.370
<v Speaker 2>We have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone somewhere in a war room has,</v>

418
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.263
<v Speaker 2>has beaten out every choice point in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of what are the circumstances </v>

419
00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:18.810
<v Speaker 2>where we would use nuclear weapons </v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

420
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.850
<v Speaker 2>what are the circumstances where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do,</v>

421
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:22.310
<v Speaker 2>where we would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

422
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.223
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we would imagine that they're </v>

423
00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 2>going to be used against us first and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then have to preempt that.</v>

424
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:28.923
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has all been thought out in a Cold </v>

425
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.873
<v Speaker 2>War context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't had to worry about anyone </v>

426
00:20:34.081 --> 00:20:34.914
<v Speaker 2>else doing this to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're talking about other </v>

427
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:39.960
<v Speaker 2>regimes like China or North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

428
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.143
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a plausible assumption that </v>

429
00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:46.470
<v Speaker 2>they're not suicidal then that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't eager to die.</v>

430
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.433
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now we are talking about a set of </v>

431
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.260
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

432
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.310
<v Speaker 2>jihadist eschatology to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that,</v>

433
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.173
<v Speaker 2>that martyrdom is a real metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle and it's not only okay to die </v>

434
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 2>in the right circumstances is the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible thing that can happen to you.</v>

435
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that there really is,</v>

436
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.243
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as innocent </v>
<v Speaker 2>collateral damage because all the good </v>

437
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:12.034
<v Speaker 2>people are going to go to paradise with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and they're just going to thank you </v>

438
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:16.414
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

439
00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:21.400
<v Speaker 2>So there's nothing can go wrong and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>world is just fit to be destroyed.</v>

440
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:27.510
<v Speaker 2>That is the ideology that you see in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>happily a,</v>

441
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 2>a small minority of Muslims at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

442
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 2>But it is not an accident that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people feel this way because it's,</v>

443
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a very plausible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literal reading of the texts during real</v>

444
00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:40.264
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that Islam is the mother lode </v>

445
00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:42.814
<v Speaker 2>of that ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I've seen since I've seen you </v>

446
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:45.304
<v Speaker 2>tweeted someone you tweeted a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago at somebody that Judaism is a </v>

447
00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.960
<v Speaker 2>motherload of bad ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

448
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I should've said the motherlode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

449
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the one moment in that exchange</v>

450
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:57.130
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with athletic wear.</v>

451
00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me,</v>

452
00:21:59.891 --> 00:22:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I misspoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just insane.</v>

453
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.650
<v Speaker 2>V as opposed to a what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I obviously I've written,</v>

454
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I've written more about Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 2>then Islam,</v>

455
00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:10.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I criticize religion in general.</v>

456
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.720
<v Speaker 2>I think faith based religion is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother lode of bad ideas.</v>

457
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.590
<v Speaker 2>My faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faith based thinking,</v>

458
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:22.591
<v Speaker 2>this idea that somehow you're wanting </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to be true is a good surrogate</v>

459
00:22:23.651 --> 00:22:25.300
<v Speaker 2>for evidence that it is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

460
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:26.134
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a way in which you can embrace self </v>

461
00:22:28.721 --> 00:22:32.020
<v Speaker 2>deception and deception of others as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate principal.</v>

462
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.243
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think as a mother lode of bad </v>

463
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:38.200
<v Speaker 2>ideas and religion has kind of a corner </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that market at the moment.</v>

464
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.130
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

465
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:39.963
<v Speaker 2>Islam is an especially dangerous a </v>
<v Speaker 2>variant of it within our current </v>

466
00:22:46.901 --> 00:22:50.830
<v Speaker 2>political rally or I should say Islamism</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to Islamic general.</v>

467
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:51.723
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say that you're talking about </v>

468
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:53.674
<v Speaker 2>because of the Geo politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the maturation of the </v>

469
00:22:56.651 --> 00:22:57.760
<v Speaker 2>religion itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

470
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.610
<v Speaker 2>We know that Judaism is far older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity's older,</v>

471
00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:02.500
<v Speaker 2>they've gone through different </v>
<v Speaker 2>reformations.</v>

472
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.780
<v Speaker 2>So partly this just has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>timing,</v>

473
00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:05.591
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

474
00:23:05.591 --> 00:23:07.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately it's not only time,</v>

475
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.033
<v Speaker 2>but timing is enough to differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because obviously Christianity 500 </v>

476
00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:15.790
<v Speaker 2>years ago was Christians were burning </v>
<v Speaker 2>people alive,</v>

477
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:17.830
<v Speaker 2>but the on street corners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

478
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:19.230
<v Speaker 2>you've written a ton about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

479
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:20.750
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying to me right now.</v>

480
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written more about that.</v>

481
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a whole book just on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity.</v>

482
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I have done that with Islam except this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

483
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.710
<v Speaker 2>this newest book that I wrote with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Majid Nawaz.</v>

484
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.530
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

485
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are historical differences between</v>

486
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Islam and Christianity and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions.</v>

487
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:37.114
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are unfortunately theological </v>

488
00:23:38.531 --> 00:23:43.531
<v Speaker 2>differences that make Islam a harder </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrine to modify.</v>

489
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 2>But it's just as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a sheer matter of history,</v>

490
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Islam has not had a reformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

491
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an enlightenment.</v>

492
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>

493
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.563
<v Speaker 2>hasn't had the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't been modulating buy maternity in </v>

494
00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:58.620
<v Speaker 2>the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

495
00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.503
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have been intellectually </v>

496
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:05.930
<v Speaker 2>isolated to a degree that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that should be unheard of,</v>

497
00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:10.931
<v Speaker 2>but it's still quite common in the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 2>century and unhappily they are,</v>

498
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.023
<v Speaker 2>they're isolated from the ideas and ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thinking that the give a science and </v>

499
00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:17.624
<v Speaker 2>give us a commitment to human rights and</v>
<v Speaker 2>give us a commitment to pluralism and </v>

500
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:21.254
<v Speaker 2>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not isolated from the </v>

501
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 2>destructive enabling technology that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've produced.</v>

502
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:29.150
<v Speaker 2>So you have people who are legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>engineers,</v>

503
00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:30.110
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And legitimate,</v>

504
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:30.944
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer scientists even who are </v>

505
00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:34.880
<v Speaker 2>jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

506
00:24:34.881 --> 00:24:35.714
<v Speaker 2>Who wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who will use the tools of maternity </v>

507
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.210
<v Speaker 2>against any kind of set of modern values</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

508
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 2>that we would be wise to defend.</v>

509
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:44.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

510
00:24:44.861 --> 00:24:47.830
<v Speaker 1>So I think what you said is it is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother load,</v>

511
00:24:47.831 --> 00:24:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but it is a motherload within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of timing,</v>

512
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.740
<v Speaker 1>geopolitics and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a whole bunch of others.</v>

513
00:24:53.741 --> 00:24:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

514
00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.090
<v Speaker 1>I certainly should've said a motherload </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

515
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.960
<v Speaker 1>It's the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to racially profile Muslims,</v>

516
00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a painful.</v>

517
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

518
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.221
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

519
00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:05.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read your piece on it.</v>

520
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.140
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually want to,</v>

521
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you're either Muslim where you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually go screw yourself.</v>

522
00:25:09.771 --> 00:25:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I am of the race that should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>profiled.</v>

523
00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:12.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you explain that a little bit </v>

524
00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:13.744
<v Speaker 1>more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've all had this experience of </v>

525
00:25:15.701 --> 00:25:16.340
<v Speaker 1>going through</v>

526
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.173
<v Speaker 2>clarity and seeing people who at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>glance you can rule out as a non </v>

527
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:26.170
<v Speaker 2>jihadist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

528
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.550
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I've argued for in,</v>

529
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.413
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the few things I've said about </v>

530
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 2>profiling is that we should be honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>about where,</v>

531
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:38.030
<v Speaker 2>what we're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking for gi suicidal jihadists.</v>

532
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:38.953
<v Speaker 2>Now there are other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

533
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.210
<v Speaker 2>there are other suicidal people who may </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring down planes,</v>

534
00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:43.640
<v Speaker 2>but as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a general matter,</v>

535
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:44.893
<v Speaker 2>we're looking for people who are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional equivalent of the 19 </v>

536
00:25:49.461 --> 00:25:50.294
<v Speaker 2>hijackers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

537
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.380
<v Speaker 2>So we're not looking for an 80 year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>women from Okinawa.</v>

538
00:25:54.381 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 2>We're not looking for a little girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Norway.</v>

539
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:00.590
<v Speaker 2>If Jerry Seinfeld is going to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport,</v>

540
00:26:00.591 --> 00:26:01.424
<v Speaker 2>if he gets the same search that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone who looks like Osama bin </v>

541
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Ladin does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy misuse of resources.</v>

542
00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Now there are little wrinkles here that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can correct for.</v>

543
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:14.270
<v Speaker 2>It's possible to put a bomb and someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else's bags.</v>

544
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.080
<v Speaker 2>All banks should be searched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the.</v>

545
00:26:16.081 --> 00:26:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can think this through,</v>

546
00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:22.421
<v Speaker 2>but there are people who you absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>know at a glance are not terrorists.</v>

547
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:23.743
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And any moment spent scrutinizing them </v>

548
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.113
<v Speaker 2>in this security theater we've all </v>
<v Speaker 2>witnessed at TSA is a moment not </v>

549
00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:35.930
<v Speaker 2>actually intelligently looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>more plausible threat.</v>

550
00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:36.764
<v Speaker 2>So I met my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My view is we have $10 worth of </v>

551
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:41.330
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you spend a dollar over here,</v>

552
00:26:41.331 --> 00:26:43.650
<v Speaker 2>you've got nine to spend elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

553
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a zero sum game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my,</v>

554
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.860
<v Speaker 2>my sense is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>

555
00:26:50.861 --> 00:26:53.910
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need well trained smart people at Tsa</v>

556
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:55.020
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a whole other.</v>

557
00:26:55.021 --> 00:26:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>

558
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.080
<v Speaker 2>it's not like we're well poised to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

559
00:26:58.081 --> 00:27:00.240
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at what the Israelis </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

560
00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:03.330
<v Speaker 2>when you look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever get on l and you look at how</v>

561
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:05.100
<v Speaker 2>they run security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

562
00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:07.170
<v Speaker 2>they look at everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

563
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.033
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's absolutely no pretense of being </v>

564
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.020
<v Speaker 2>fair in this process and there shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

565
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:13.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a.</v>

566
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.140
<v Speaker 2>and when I go through security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.350
<v Speaker 2>50 percent of the people to me look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

568
00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that I'm an expert here,</v>

569
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:22.314
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

570
00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.750
<v Speaker 2>I pay attention to this sort of stuff a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

571
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.093
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be willing to bet my life that </v>

572
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 2>certain people are just in this blog </v>
<v Speaker 2>post.</v>

573
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:33.234
<v Speaker 2>I showed a picture of one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a one old woman who you just know </v>

574
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's absolutely no way she's joined.</v>

575
00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you look at her and you say,</v>

576
00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:42.564
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scrutiny on her is a waste of time </v>

577
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:45.594
<v Speaker 2>and it's a dangerous waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the interest of appearing fair </v>

578
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.900
<v Speaker 2>and we are actually ramping up our risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

579
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.640
<v Speaker 2>and being appearing right because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just appearing.</v>

580
00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:57.550
<v Speaker 2>It's not actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

581
00:27:57.551 --> 00:28:00.300
<v Speaker 2>But you and I fit it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fit the profile,</v>

582
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young to middle aged men who could be,</v>

583
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.500
<v Speaker 2>we could be jihadists right there.</v>

584
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.820
<v Speaker 2>There are jihadists who ally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

585
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:09.830
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

586
00:28:09.831 --> 00:28:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Adam Gadahn or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

587
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.823
<v Speaker 2>and in these other western recruits to </v>
<v Speaker 2>al Qaeda or isis who functionally look </v>

588
00:28:18.421 --> 00:28:19.081
<v Speaker 2>like us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

589
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:20.220
<v Speaker 2>they don't look like Arabs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

590
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not holding Pakistani passports.</v>

591
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

592
00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:26.064
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not letting myself off the hook </v>

593
00:28:27.061 --> 00:28:27.840
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I,</v>

594
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want me and the other white guys to </v>

595
00:28:29.611 --> 00:28:30.930
<v Speaker 2>just sail through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

596
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.470
<v Speaker 2>it's just there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are still people who are obviously</v>

597
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:35.304
<v Speaker 2>not jihadists and until these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>start blowing themselves up on planes I </v>

598
00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:40.220
<v Speaker 2>am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're,</v>

599
00:28:40.221 --> 00:28:43.260
<v Speaker 2>we'd be wise to just admit we know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're looking for,</v>

600
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.090
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have some sense of what we're looking</v>

601
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:45.924
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just to be crystal clear in that </v>

602
00:28:47.071 --> 00:28:48.720
<v Speaker 2>post,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally said,</v>

603
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.673
<v Speaker 2>I'm just reiterating what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you should be picked out and </v>

604
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.070
<v Speaker 2>you actually should be picked up.</v>

605
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.903
<v Speaker 2>And as I describe it as anti profiling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I want certain people </v>

606
00:28:57.331 --> 00:28:58.164
<v Speaker 2>profiled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want us to admit that certain </v>

607
00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:02.310
<v Speaker 2>people require less scrutiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

608
00:29:02.311 --> 00:29:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Seinfeld is one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

609
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.150
<v Speaker 2>when you see a famous celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

610
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.093
<v Speaker 2>go through security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treat it as though he just may have </v>

611
00:29:10.261 --> 00:29:11.640
<v Speaker 2>become a jihadist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

612
00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

613
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.650
<v Speaker 2>when no one was watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

614
00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.110
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy making it is security </v>
<v Speaker 2>theater.</v>

615
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:16.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>

616
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.893
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many people who though not </v>

617
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:20.873
<v Speaker 2>famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are every bit as unlikely to be members </v>

618
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:29.040
<v Speaker 2>of al Qaeda as a prominent people who we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

619
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:29.874
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Betty White,</v>

620
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:31.350
<v Speaker 2>betty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Betty White is,</v>

621
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

622
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I would not be happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a surprise.</v>

623
00:29:34.361 --> 00:29:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will have one if they weren't.</v>

624
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Betty white gets a profile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

625
00:29:38.881 --> 00:29:39.714
<v Speaker 2>So the final one of these sort of five </v>
<v Speaker 2>pillars of Sam Harris being the big one </v>

626
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.440
<v Speaker 2>is your anneal con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

627
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.320
<v Speaker 2>so I think we should define neo-con </v>
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

628
00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:50.154
<v Speaker 2>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to handle that or do you want </v>

629
00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:51.480
<v Speaker 2>me to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

630
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it means many things to many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

631
00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

632
00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

633
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.830
<v Speaker 2>the attitude toward foreign policy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most was,</v>

634
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.753
<v Speaker 2>was canonized by people like Richard </v>
<v Speaker 2>Perle and Paul Wolfowitz in the run up </v>

635
00:30:08.701 --> 00:30:09.480
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

636
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

637
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.290
<v Speaker 4>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

638
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or our,</v>

639
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.930
<v Speaker 4>our invasion of Iraq after nine slash </v>
<v Speaker 4>11.</v>

640
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:18.933
<v Speaker 2>This idea that we can go in in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscular way and just create nations </v>

641
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 2>along democratic lines and that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy should be very aggressive</v>

642
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:29.470
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

643
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:30.304
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll fight them over there so we don't </v>

644
00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 2>have to fight them here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

645
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.433
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

646
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I think we've all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was,</v>

647
00:30:36.221 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never for the Iraq war.</v>

648
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:38.974
<v Speaker 2>I was never a vocally against it either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just was at every moment through that </v>

649
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:46.330
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just painfully aware that I had no</v>

650
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:47.164
<v Speaker 2>idea what to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apart from it looked very risky and it </v>

651
00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:54.310
<v Speaker 2>looked like a frank distraction from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>war in Afghanistan,</v>

652
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:55.144
<v Speaker 2>which did seem to me to be necessary and</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed like something we were probably </v>

653
00:30:58.571 --> 00:30:59.404
<v Speaker 2>gonna botch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing you can say against </v>

654
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:01.983
<v Speaker 2>neoconservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that it is idealistic to a </v>

655
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:09.070
<v Speaker 2>degree that now seems not at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable.</v>

656
00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:09.904
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>W we,</v>

657
00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.590
<v Speaker 2>we should have learned a lesson at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

658
00:31:11.591 --> 00:31:14.140
<v Speaker 2>which is we don't do this very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't nation build very well.</v>

659
00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.453
<v Speaker 2>We have a political environment where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>just can't stay committed to these </v>

660
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:19.070
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if we were,</v>

661
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:20.560
<v Speaker 2>we're doing it well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

662
00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:21.020
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

663
00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.230
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we view everything through a four year,</v>

664
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Presidential Lens and an election cycle.</v>

665
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.510
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these are,</v>

666
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.050
<v Speaker 2>these are multi-decade commitments if </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do this as well.</v>

667
00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:33.490
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

668
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:34.683
<v Speaker 2>but Iraq looks like a disaster and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like a disaster for most of the </v>

669
00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:39.770
<v Speaker 2>time apart from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

670
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes thereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the surge.</v>

671
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I certainly don't consider myself an</v>

672
00:31:45.601 --> 00:31:46.450
<v Speaker 2>neo-con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

673
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.333
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think we have to be honest about </v>

674
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.593
<v Speaker 2>in ethical terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is really going on in the world </v>

675
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:52.924
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to say that we never </v>

676
00:31:53.921 --> 00:31:54.754
<v Speaker 2>should have gone into Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a reasonable thing to </v>

677
00:31:57.041 --> 00:31:57.874
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a reasonable thing to say </v>

678
00:31:58.571 --> 00:31:59.404
<v Speaker 2>then you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only decent to admit how depressing </v>

679
00:32:05.021 --> 00:32:06.730
<v Speaker 2>a claim this really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot.</v>

680
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:07.564
<v Speaker 2>We're saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Iraq is a place that requires a </v>

681
00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:17.470
<v Speaker 2>psychopathic thug to run it in a given </v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of religious sectarianism,</v>

682
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.480
<v Speaker 2>given the fact that when you remove a </v>
<v Speaker 2>butcher like Saddam Hussein,</v>

683
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.750
<v Speaker 2>everyone starts killing their neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

684
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in fact what happened.</v>

685
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:28.443
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and which is in fact they political and </v>

686
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:30.634
<v Speaker 2>religious reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We underestimated when we walked in </v>

687
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:33.604
<v Speaker 2>there thinking that they were just going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put flowers in the barrels of our </v>

688
00:32:35.741 --> 00:32:37.450
<v Speaker 2>guns and welcome us as liberators.</v>

689
00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a,</v>

690
00:32:42.171 --> 00:32:43.004
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very depressing thing to admit </v>

691
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:47.330
<v Speaker 2>about the state of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a place like Iraq.</v>

692
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.193
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we should all mean I view </v>

693
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Iraq as initially we went when Saddam </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there as a,</v>

694
00:32:53.411 --> 00:32:54.244
<v Speaker 2>as a kind of hostage crisis when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a totally illegitimate regime run </v>

695
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:00.910
<v Speaker 2>by barbarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

696
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 2>keeping tens of millions of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>hostage.</v>

697
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.773
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the people who criticize the war </v>

698
00:33:08.391 --> 00:33:11.300
<v Speaker 2>based on saying that it was a sovereign </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

699
00:33:11.301 --> 00:33:12.134
<v Speaker 2>And we should never have gone in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a failure to engage with </v>

700
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.093
<v Speaker 2>the moral reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this was a terrible place to </v>

701
00:33:20.691 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 2>live and if we could have done something</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help these people,</v>

702
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.313
<v Speaker 2>we should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are many countries that fit </v>

703
00:33:25.821 --> 00:33:27.590
<v Speaker 2>that description.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean North Korea is one of them.</v>

704
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.753
<v Speaker 2>If there would be some way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to depose that regime and liberate the </v>

705
00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:37.880
<v Speaker 2>North Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should do it now.</v>

706
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 2>We know that it would just be a bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>mess if we tried and we're learning that</v>

707
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 2>more and more in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these other societies.</v>

708
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.100
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

709
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:46.934
<v Speaker 2>so neoconservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what its current state is </v>

710
00:33:49.011 --> 00:33:52.250
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't imagine anyone is,</v>

711
00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even Wolfowitz or parole is a,</v>

712
00:33:55.341 --> 00:33:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine any of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are as saying what about the possibility</v>

713
00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:01.670
<v Speaker 2>of building a nation anywhere from </v>
<v Speaker 2>scratch.</v>

714
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a great point.</v>

715
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:03.644
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are these guys still believing that </v>

716
00:34:04.881 --> 00:34:05.714
<v Speaker 2>idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they think if we went back into a </v>

717
00:34:06.491 --> 00:34:07.370
<v Speaker 2>rack right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it,</v>

718
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.230
<v Speaker 2>would it be any better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I somehow doubt it.</v>

719
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no I.</v>

720
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.383
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that that we created isis </v>

721
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:20.510
<v Speaker 2>by going into a rack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also just delusional,</v>

722
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.051
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

723
00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:21.884
<v Speaker 2>the set of ideas that get gives us isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the set of ideas and the level </v>

724
00:34:27.141 --> 00:34:29.310
<v Speaker 2>of sectarianism that gave us the civil </v>
<v Speaker 2>war that,</v>

725
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:30.230
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

726
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.063
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could barely contain a that drove us </v>

727
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:33.374
<v Speaker 2>out of Iraq and that set of ideas in one</v>
<v Speaker 2>or another degree has been animating a </v>

728
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:41.000
<v Speaker 2>subset of the Muslim world for a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

729
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.863
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is where I think some of your </v>

730
00:34:42.531 --> 00:34:43.820
<v Speaker 2>critics would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

731
00:34:43.821 --> 00:34:44.654
<v Speaker 2>you're blaming things more on religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the geopolitics because had we </v>

732
00:34:47.871 --> 00:34:48.704
<v Speaker 2>never gone to Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saddam would still be there and that </v>

733
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.140
<v Speaker 2>isis would be controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But basically you're saying this,</v>

734
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.710
<v Speaker 2>this thing sorta would have bubbled up </v>
<v Speaker 2>one way or another.</v>

735
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Is that so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

736
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:01.963
<v Speaker 2>but if isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those religious sectarian commitments </v>

737
00:35:05.571 --> 00:35:10.571
<v Speaker 2>were controlled by a dictator a that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

738
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.463
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to me an intrinsically </v>

739
00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:15.320
<v Speaker 2>unstable situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At some point they're going to,</v>

740
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.290
<v Speaker 2>they're going to bubble up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm.</v>

741
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's just admit how depressing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>remedy is.</v>

742
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:24.010
<v Speaker 2>And we're talking about someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a torture chamber,</v>

743
00:35:24.011 --> 00:35:24.844
<v Speaker 2>is running full time and he's got sons </v>
<v Speaker 2>who show up at people's weddings and </v>

744
00:35:28.941 --> 00:35:30.560
<v Speaker 2>rape the bride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

745
00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:31.394
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this is just a playground for </v>

746
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 2>sociopath's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's what it takes to modulate the,</v>

747
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.560
<v Speaker 2>the Sunni Shia Internet saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

748
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animosity,</v>

749
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

750
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

751
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

752
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.420
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does not exonerate religion,</v>

753
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.283
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it does not exonerate at that level </v>

754
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:57.260
<v Speaker 2>of commitment to a device of theology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

755
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.470
<v Speaker 2>and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

756
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:00.150
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

757
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.030
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

758
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:05.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

759
00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.553
<v Speaker 2>I think it is totally appropriate to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>humble about how hard it is to help </v>

760
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 2>people in these circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at a place like Rwanda,</v>

761
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 2>right where Clinton's one regret was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we didn't do more to help,</v>

762
00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to,</v>

763
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.170
<v Speaker 2>to prevent that genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

764
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.143
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a total failure to intervene and the </v>

765
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:30.930
<v Speaker 2>resulting massacre of nearly a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

766
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

767
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:34.010
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was something we,</v>

768
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:38.460
<v Speaker 2>we should not play that hand precisely </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way again.</v>

769
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should do something differently.</v>

770
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.260
<v Speaker 2>We should have intervened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then what do you think we should do</v>

771
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:43.981
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

772
00:36:43.981 --> 00:36:46.350
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening to these cds and in,</v>

773
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.560
<v Speaker 2>under the Islamic state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

774
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 2>we got people being crucified by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the road.</v>

775
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:50.993
<v Speaker 2>We've got thousands of sex slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got gay is being thrown from </v>

776
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:55.434
<v Speaker 2>rooftops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>

777
00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:00.090
<v Speaker 2>So do we intervene or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

778
00:37:00.091 --> 00:37:02.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious,</v>

779
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.583
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's anything we can do in each </v>

780
00:37:05.491 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 2>one of these circumstances to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

781
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:07.854
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that you are a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster to even think that we should </v>

782
00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:15.090
<v Speaker 2>intervene is deeply suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

783
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:16.003
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of my intentions with this show </v>

784
00:37:17.191 --> 00:37:18.024
<v Speaker 2>is that I really want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and not people and I think that's </v>

785
00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:22.500
<v Speaker 2>what we've done so far for the half hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>or so,</v>

786
00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:23.334
<v Speaker 2>but I do think sometimes you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>address certain people within the </v>

787
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:27.144
<v Speaker 2>context of these conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have to talk about one of your </v>

788
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:31.590
<v Speaker 2>favorite people to start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reza Aslan,</v>

789
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.053
<v Speaker 2>who in my view has repeatedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>mischaracterize and misrepresented your </v>

790
00:37:37.451 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 2>abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done this in a very forum.</v>

791
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

792
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:45.600
<v Speaker 2>say to my former boss jaggery that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bill,</v>

793
00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:46.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is about all Muslims than the </v>

794
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:49.643
<v Speaker 2>day later I'll see them on Huffington </v>
<v Speaker 2>Post live saying that bill is his </v>

795
00:37:50.971 --> 00:37:51.300
<v Speaker 2>friend.</v>

796
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.133
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a myriad of things that don't sort </v>

797
00:37:54.241 --> 00:37:56.490
<v Speaker 2>of add up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>

798
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:58.800
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like maybe he half made up his</v>
<v Speaker 2>bio.</v>

799
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make this about people,</v>

800
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:02.520
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I do think this has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressed.</v>

801
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.673
<v Speaker 2>So you want to just take that and put it</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere because I also sense that </v>

802
00:38:06.331 --> 00:38:08.230
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about right.</v>

803
00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you say on twitter that you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't going to do it anymore and then.</v>

804
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.860
<v Speaker 2>And then he feels like the mafia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you get sucked back in,</v>

805
00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:14.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

806
00:38:14.881 --> 00:38:15.491
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

807
00:38:15.491 --> 00:38:17.760
<v Speaker 2>I took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I declared a unilateral ceasefire at one</v>

808
00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:18.594
<v Speaker 2>point on my podcast saying that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>never mentioned these people again </v>

809
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:24.330
<v Speaker 2>unless absolutely necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

810
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:25.763
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I kind of painted myself into a </v>

811
00:38:26.641 --> 00:38:28.320
<v Speaker 2>corner there because they don't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

812
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.900
<v Speaker 2>people like Glenn Greenwald and Reza are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

813
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.030
<v Speaker 2>have the larger platforms.</v>

814
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 2>But there are many people who fit this </v>
<v Speaker 2>description where they,</v>

815
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:38.403
<v Speaker 2>they seem to imagine that it's fair and </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually legitimate to </v>

816
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:44.613
<v Speaker 2>misrepresent the views of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponents as a way of sliming them </v>

817
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 2>because they know it's effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

818
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:49.654
<v Speaker 2>if you can just get something to stick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good because the person you're </v>

819
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:55.640
<v Speaker 2>arguing against is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

820
00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:01.710
<v Speaker 2>so I'm unethical in his or her </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitments that it's,</v>

821
00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:05.930
<v Speaker 2>this is the end justifies the means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

822
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:06.441
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

823
00:39:06.441 --> 00:39:07.274
<v Speaker 2>and I'm noticing more and more of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is obviously not a problem just </v>

824
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:12.550
<v Speaker 2>with razor or Glenn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a,</v>

825
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.010
<v Speaker 2>a larger problem in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

826
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.770
<v Speaker 2>conversation with one another and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

827
00:39:17.771 --> 00:39:18.521
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

828
00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:19.354
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be a pathology that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressing itself on the left </v>

829
00:39:23.711 --> 00:39:26.510
<v Speaker 2>politically in a way that I'm not seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it quite so much on the right.</v>

830
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get attacked by people on the right,</v>

831
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 2>but they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>

832
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.770
<v Speaker 2>do me the courtesy of understanding what</v>
<v Speaker 2>my views are.</v>

833
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.140
<v Speaker 2>And they attended a Bible thumper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

834
00:39:38.141 --> 00:39:39.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

835
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know Rick Warren or anyone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

836
00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I have debated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

837
00:39:43.031 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

838
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.433
<v Speaker 2>he will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he understands what my position is and </v>

839
00:39:48.731 --> 00:39:49.564
<v Speaker 2>then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he disagrees with it based on his own </v>

840
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.470
<v Speaker 2>commitments and then we can have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest debate,</v>

841
00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

842
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.880
<v Speaker 2>and it can be totally pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be barbed onstage,</v>

843
00:39:57.881 --> 00:39:59.890
<v Speaker 2>but it can be totally pleasant in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>green room because we,</v>

844
00:39:59.891 --> 00:40:00.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

845
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.370
<v Speaker 2>we both know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what game we're playing and uh,</v>

846
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:04.263
<v Speaker 2>but with these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not at all pleasant in the green </v>

847
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:07.900
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

848
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.690
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

849
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.650
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to engage at this point.</v>

850
00:40:11.651 --> 00:40:15.760
<v Speaker 2>It's just so poisonous and mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crucial piece is,</v>

851
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.310
<v Speaker 2>and this is something I honestly can </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

852
00:40:18.311 --> 00:40:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm innocent of Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I've ever done this,</v>

853
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:24.040
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it intentionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the moment I've noticed I've done</v>

854
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:25.810
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've apologized for it.</v>

855
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:28.243
<v Speaker 2>The crucial sin here intellectually and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically is misrepresenting the other </v>

856
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:37.160
<v Speaker 2>person's views as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a strategy for defaming them or,</v>

857
00:40:37.161 --> 00:40:38.290
<v Speaker 2>or marginalizing them.</v>

858
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has been done repeatedly.</v>

859
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.104
<v Speaker 1>So in the example of Resident Glen let </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've retweeted memes saying that you </v>

860
00:40:45.161 --> 00:40:45.994
<v Speaker 1>want to nuke the whole middle of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff that we've been talking </v>

861
00:40:48.131 --> 00:40:48.964
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm particularly interested in </v>

862
00:40:50.461 --> 00:40:55.461
<v Speaker 1>here is that I see this on the left too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the left so I care more about the</v>

863
00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:58.990
<v Speaker 1>left and to me the right went over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep end already,</v>

864
00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:03.610
<v Speaker 1>but I want to bring the left back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sorta saying middle ground.</v>

865
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.130
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think is actually going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on here?</v>

866
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:06.964
<v Speaker 1>I had a Dr Gadd sat on a couple of weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago and he said that basically this is </v>

867
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:13.600
<v Speaker 1>just the age old thing where you go for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intellectuals first.</v>

868
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.080
<v Speaker 1>So someone like Reza I think probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't really.</v>

869
00:41:17.081 --> 00:41:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I know you have debated in but can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really defeat you,</v>

870
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.380
<v Speaker 1>so to speak in a debate so that he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to this.</v>

871
00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Because as you said at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this,</v>

872
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.720
<v Speaker 1>40 percent of this stuff just sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

873
00:41:28.721 --> 00:41:32.230
<v Speaker 1>You say racist when our 40 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically believe you're racist.</v>

874
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

875
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

876
00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:38.330
<v Speaker 2>to bend over backwards to be charitable </v>
<v Speaker 2>to these guys,</v>

877
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:40.220
<v Speaker 2>I can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

878
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.013
<v Speaker 2>we're all guilty of kind of a bandwidth </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and an impatience with views </v>

879
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:52.800
<v Speaker 2>that were not sympathetic with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And frankly we all are.</v>

880
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:53.703
<v Speaker 2>It's possible for any one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how scrupulous we attempt to </v>

881
00:41:57.801 --> 00:41:58.634
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not take enough time to understand </v>

882
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.780
<v Speaker 2>the position we're criticizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

883
00:42:02.781 --> 00:42:03.614
<v Speaker 2>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you feel like if it's somebody </v>

884
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

885
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Glenn Beck or rush limbaugh or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

886
00:42:11.541 --> 00:42:12.374
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ann Coulter or somebody on the right </v>

887
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.030
<v Speaker 2>with whom I'm basically unsympathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I basically,</v>

888
00:42:17.031 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I have the gist of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>their opinions are or likely to be.</v>

889
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 2>And then they say something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

890
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.193
<v Speaker 2>I have a shorter fuse with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I have less of a reason to really </v>

891
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:29.210
<v Speaker 2>look into what their position actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

892
00:42:29.211 --> 00:42:33.230
<v Speaker 2>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a time bandwidth problem,</v>

893
00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's understandable.</v>

894
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.840
<v Speaker 2>But it creates huge pr problems in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with,</v>

895
00:42:37.841 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left and right and on any given topic.</v>

896
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the crucial problem is,</v>

897
00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>

898
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am now to a moral certainty.</v>

899
00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:50.834
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've encountered in these guys is they </v>

900
00:42:52.581 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 2>know they're misrepresenting you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a strategy and I think it comes out</v>

901
00:42:57.021 --> 00:43:02.021
<v Speaker 2>of I'm just a feeling that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very cynical,</v>

902
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:06.980
<v Speaker 2>a relationship to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very cynical relationship to,</v>

903
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:07.933
<v Speaker 2>to the significance of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you started this segment talking </v>

904
00:43:10.371 --> 00:43:12.500
<v Speaker 2>about the distinction between ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

905
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Now these are people who really don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think ideas matter very much.</v>

906
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:20.684
<v Speaker 2>I mean certainly I don't think religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas matter very much and the </v>

907
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:24.520
<v Speaker 2>differences between religious ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

908
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Razah is always talking about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

909
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.280
<v Speaker 2>religions are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

910
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:31.750
<v Speaker 2>so networks of symbols and metaphors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

911
00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:32.643
<v Speaker 2>this kind of postmodernist nonsense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out of his mouth when he was </v>

912
00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.880
<v Speaker 2>talking about the truth claims of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

913
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.890
<v Speaker 2>And the punchline is nobody ever really </v>
<v Speaker 2>does anything based on religion.</v>

914
00:43:42.891 --> 00:43:44.850
<v Speaker 2>It's always some other reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

915
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.150
<v Speaker 2>It's psychology is politics is </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics.</v>

916
00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard him say that you actually </v>

917
00:43:49.971 --> 00:43:50.804
<v Speaker 2>believe in this stuff the most because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you quoted and he obviously </v>

918
00:43:54.111 --> 00:43:56.010
<v Speaker 2>knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he says things.</v>

919
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.060
<v Speaker 2>You know what he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and every time I come up he'll say,</v>

920
00:43:59.061 --> 00:43:59.894
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get my view about religion from Fox </v>

921
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.953
<v Speaker 2>News right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any chance he believes that </v>

922
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:09.880
<v Speaker 2>there is no chance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you've proven anything easy,</v>

923
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:13.010
<v Speaker 2>you look in the bibliography of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my first book,</v>

924
00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:13.844
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a thousand references </v>

925
00:44:14.691 --> 00:44:15.380
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

926
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.213
<v Speaker 2>There's absolutely no chance he believes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's absolutely no chance he </v>

927
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:22.460
<v Speaker 2>thinks I've called for a nuclear first </v>
<v Speaker 2>strike on the Muslim world,</v>

928
00:44:22.461 --> 00:44:25.310
<v Speaker 2>and yet he retweets a tweet that calls </v>
<v Speaker 2>me a genocidal fascist.</v>

929
00:44:25.311 --> 00:44:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

930
00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:26.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

931
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.860
<v Speaker 2>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Glenn Greenwald was in this category</v>

932
00:44:30.861 --> 00:44:32.370
<v Speaker 2>and Jenkins as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

933
00:44:32.371 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris hedges all of them.</v>

934
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.070
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with this is that it works.</v>

935
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:41.070
<v Speaker 2>It actually because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because then for the rest of my life,</v>

936
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:41.933
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be seeing people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely sure on every comment thread </v>

937
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:46.974
<v Speaker 2>I'm ever going to see there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will see people who are absolutely </v>

938
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:50.124
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've called for a genocidal nuclear </v>

939
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Speaker 2>holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

940
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

941
00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 2>and many other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a,</v>

942
00:44:58.381 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

943
00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:01.380
<v Speaker 2>it's very depressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it works.</v>

944
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:06.240
<v Speaker 2>And there really is no way to respond </v>
<v Speaker 2>adequately to it.</v>

945
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:09.330
<v Speaker 2>And so I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had on my blog for years now a,</v>

946
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:10.303
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

947
00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:11.883
<v Speaker 2>post entitled response to controversy </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I deal with each one of these </v>

948
00:45:15.091 --> 00:45:17.550
<v Speaker 2>things as they come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a year later I'll,</v>

949
00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll revisit it and fine tune it.</v>

950
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.010
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

951
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you search response to controversy on</v>

952
00:45:26.341 --> 00:45:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the number one result.</v>

953
00:45:27.871 --> 00:45:28.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

954
00:45:28.251 --> 00:45:28.911
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

955
00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:31.410
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of depressing to associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that phrase,</v>

956
00:45:31.411 --> 00:45:35.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it still is not an addict.</v>

957
00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:39.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like a 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>word letter to the editor essentially.</v>

958
00:45:39.481 --> 00:45:39.990
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

959
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.823
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an adequate way of addressing </v>

960
00:45:41.941 --> 00:45:46.941
<v Speaker 2>this and it's not adequate because a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people just don't care what the truth</v>

961
00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:48.084
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just liked the fact that your </v>

962
00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.253
<v Speaker 2>ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can destroy your opponents </v>

963
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:54.810
<v Speaker 2>reputation by calling him a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

964
00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.673
<v Speaker 1>So that's where I have to bring up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person here that we've sort of </v>

965
00:45:58.741 --> 00:45:59.860
<v Speaker 1>danced around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

966
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's the personal part to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So jank obviously Janky.</v>

967
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Greg is the founder of the young Turks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CEO of the network.</v>

968
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.213
<v Speaker 1>I worked for him for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still play basketball with him every </v>

969
00:46:09.481 --> 00:46:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

970
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:15.240
<v Speaker 1>you sat with him for three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for three hours unaided on his channel.</v>

971
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.450
<v Speaker 1>They put about five commercials in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has over a million views.</v>

972
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:19.284
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they made a lot of money on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You calmly explained to him at the </v>

973
00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:25.620
<v Speaker 1>beginning that basically he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly slandering you.</v>

974
00:46:25.621 --> 00:46:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the word slander,</v>

975
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:27.534
<v Speaker 1>but that he was repeatedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>misrepresenting your views and that you </v>

976
00:46:29.731 --> 00:46:33.420
<v Speaker 1>were there to clean up the mess and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sat there for three hours,</v>

977
00:46:33.421 --> 00:46:35.820
<v Speaker 1>clearly laid out what you think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

978
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I was still working there at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then after that he only doubled down</v>

979
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.230
<v Speaker 1>on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

980
00:46:43.231 --> 00:46:44.064
<v Speaker 1>you not only doubled down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I see this all the time now on </v>

981
00:46:46.111 --> 00:46:48.900
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will take little video clips,</v>

982
00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:51.360
<v Speaker 1>ten second video clips of him saying one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to you,</v>

983
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:53.100
<v Speaker 1>and then what he said when you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

984
00:46:53.101 --> 00:46:55.260
<v Speaker 1>even after and things that he said to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Reza,</v>

985
00:46:55.261 --> 00:46:57.780
<v Speaker 1>knowing that that's not what you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of this stuff.</v>

986
00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the personal part to me,</v>

987
00:47:00.001 --> 00:47:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I just have to say it because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been asking me forever.</v>

988
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.910
<v Speaker 1>So it obviously had a good amount to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with why I left.</v>

989
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.570
<v Speaker 1>So I just want to put that out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a more for my audience.</v>

990
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.030
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of the three hours sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

991
00:47:12.031 --> 00:47:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a long time to sit with somebody.</v>

992
00:47:13.561 --> 00:47:14.940
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to go three hours.</v>

993
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.610
<v Speaker 1>You did three hours with one glass of </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

994
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.713
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your wildest imagination think that </v>

995
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.370
<v Speaker 1>it was going to get worse after that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in my opinion,</v>

996
00:47:23.371 --> 00:47:24.204
<v Speaker 1>at least it did.</v>

997
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:24.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

998
00:47:24.981 --> 00:47:25.201
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

999
00:47:25.201 --> 00:47:26.001
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1000
00:47:26.001 --> 00:47:31.001
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see he was following me entirely</v>

1001
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.033
<v Speaker 2>so I could see that he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a kind of a fundamental </v>

1002
00:47:36.311 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 2>disinclination to have his opinion about</v>
<v Speaker 2>me changed by anything.</v>

1003
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1004
00:47:41.801 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 2>so when you encounter that in someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that it's not,</v>

1005
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.740
<v Speaker 2>it's not functioning by the usual rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>of conversation.</v>

1006
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:48.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1007
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing that's so poisonous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the.</v>

1008
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:52.421
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1009
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:54.760
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately I encountered this more on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left than,</v>

1010
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.700
<v Speaker 2>than elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

1011
00:47:58.830 --> 00:47:59.663
<v Speaker 2>every one on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment seems to be a mind reader </v>

1012
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:04.323
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're trying to detecting you </v>

1013
00:48:07.991 --> 00:48:11.650
<v Speaker 2>evidence of a view which you claim you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't hold,</v>

1014
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.980
<v Speaker 2>but the moment they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can string together anything you've</v>

1015
00:48:14.981 --> 00:48:18.490
<v Speaker 2>said that seems to align up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something they want to find in you.</v>

1016
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.060
<v Speaker 2>They will hold you accountable to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>misunderstanding.</v>

1017
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:26.110
<v Speaker 2>And no matter how much you try to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>their foot out of your mouth,</v>

1018
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:28.370
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

1019
00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:29.243
<v Speaker 2>The mirror effort itself is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>counted against you if you're just </v>

1020
00:48:31.621 --> 00:48:35.080
<v Speaker 2>someone who's in denial or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really understand how racist you are,</v>

1021
00:48:35.081 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1022
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:38.220
<v Speaker 2>and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1023
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1024
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.960
<v Speaker 2>so for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the classic example on twitter,</v>

1025
00:48:43.961 --> 00:48:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I often see that,</v>

1026
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.863
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I say something critical about </v>

1027
00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will get back,</v>

1028
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:52.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you ever criticize </v>

1029
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Christianity or Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which obviously I do my book,</v>

1030
00:48:56.351 --> 00:49:01.351
<v Speaker 2>but now I recently said something very </v>
<v Speaker 2>disparaging about Orthodox Judaism and I</v>

1031
00:49:02.741 --> 00:49:03.574
<v Speaker 2>saw on twitter people claiming that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just covering for my racism with </v>

1032
00:49:08.711 --> 00:49:11.140
<v Speaker 2>respect to the Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that made sense.</v>

1033
00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is just a token way of,</v>

1034
00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:16.600
<v Speaker 2>of just misdirection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1035
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't really feel this about Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judaism.</v>

1036
00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.540
<v Speaker 2>There is no way to dig out from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1037
00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:22.810
<v Speaker 2>really think how perverse that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're all mind readers,</v>

1038
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:27.640
<v Speaker 2>they're all psychics who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are plumbing the depths of your con,</v>

1039
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:31.480
<v Speaker 2>detecting things in you that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even know about yourself.</v>

1040
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Do you wish your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that da?</v>

1041
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1042
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1043
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish it was amazing to me is,</v>

1044
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is such a confused moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>position because they're claiming.</v>

1045
00:49:41.651 --> 00:49:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying all these horrendous things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1046
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I say we should racially profile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say we should nuclear the,</v>

1047
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:48.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1048
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:50.380
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no great.</v>

1049
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Now say they're going to select the edit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I say it right.</v>

1050
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:55.480
<v Speaker 2>I say we should torture people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1051
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.410
<v Speaker 2>These are my claims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I say no,</v>

1052
00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:01.690
<v Speaker 2>this is not actually what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I said.</v>

1053
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1054
00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say I,</v>

1055
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.353
<v Speaker 2>I say incredibly controversial things if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually honestly engaged with what </v>

1056
00:50:13.121 --> 00:50:14.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are very,</v>

1057
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:15.004
<v Speaker 2>I take controversial positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never hiding what I actually </v>

1058
00:50:17.921 --> 00:50:18.620
<v Speaker 2>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1059
00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.440
<v Speaker 2>It's just like I'm walking right up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the line.</v>

1060
00:50:20.441 --> 00:50:21.274
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm going to say though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's though it is politically </v>

1061
00:50:22.871 --> 00:50:23.704
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about the ethics of </v>

1062
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 2>torture publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1063
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a thankless job if there </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever was one.</v>

1064
00:50:29.901 --> 00:50:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet they're claiming to detect in me</v>

1065
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:38.750
<v Speaker 2>commitments that I'm disavowing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just no way you can disavow them</v>

1066
00:50:38.751 --> 00:50:39.530
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they,</v>

1067
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:40.131
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1068
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insist there.</v>

1069
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to have the battle of ideas,</v>

1071
00:50:43.511 --> 00:50:47.050
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what liberalism should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be for and they don't seem to want to do</v>

1072
00:50:47.051 --> 00:50:47.884
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just want to wrap this up with one </v>

1073
00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:49.893
<v Speaker 1>final question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1074
00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.560
<v Speaker 1>this portion of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1075
00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:52.403
<v Speaker 1>so just putting it flat out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have tweeted at Jank publicly and </v>

1076
00:50:54.971 --> 00:50:55.804
<v Speaker 1>respectfully several times since I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>left the network to engage him on this </v>

1077
00:50:58.571 --> 00:51:00.640
<v Speaker 1>and I sort of laid out some things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed out,</v>

1078
00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.790
<v Speaker 1>showed some evidence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this or that and he just ignored me.</v>

1079
00:51:03.791 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 1>So I just think I just have to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1080
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:10.060
<v Speaker 1>everyone can think what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my final question on this is what do</v>

1081
00:51:10.061 --> 00:51:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you think we should do about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

1082
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that your engagement at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this point,</v>

1083
00:51:16.301 --> 00:51:17.134
<v Speaker 1>were you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've seen someone lie repeatedly </v>

1084
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:20.703
<v Speaker 1>misrepresent your views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things when you've seen </v>

1085
00:51:22.211 --> 00:51:23.950
<v Speaker 1>this happen repeatedly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Repeatedly.</v>

1086
00:51:23.951 --> 00:51:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And then I started seeing it bleed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

1087
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:28.953
<v Speaker 1>Do you keep engaging or at some point do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just put your hands up and I'm </v>

1088
00:51:31.271 --> 00:51:32.104
<v Speaker 1>guessing you struggle with this yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were sort of ready to put </v>

1089
00:51:33.761 --> 00:51:35.350
<v Speaker 1>your hands up and then you got sucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

1090
00:51:35.351 --> 00:51:36.610
<v Speaker 1>But where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you stand on that now?</v>

1091
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:37.463
<v Speaker 2>And I wish I had an algorithm for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for how to deal with this because </v>

1092
00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:41.510
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1093
00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:43.880
<v Speaker 2>it's very haphazard on my side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1094
00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'll,</v>

1095
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll just see a tweet that I just can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>let go,</v>

1096
00:51:47.031 --> 00:51:47.864
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll go for weeks or months or </v>

1097
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:52.490
<v Speaker 2>in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even years,</v>

1098
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:56.970
<v Speaker 2>not dealing with this directly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think in so far,</v>

1099
00:51:56.971 --> 00:52:00.740
<v Speaker 2>if someone has a big platform you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with,</v>

1100
00:52:00.741 --> 00:52:03.600
<v Speaker 2>it's somewhat some of the time because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1101
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:08.510
<v Speaker 2>because I see the consequences of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully misleading people.</v>

1102
00:52:08.511 --> 00:52:09.344
<v Speaker 2>And so either the people who I will </v>
<v Speaker 2>never mentioned it never deal with </v>

1103
00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:13.520
<v Speaker 2>because they're kind of smaller fish in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1104
00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:17.330
<v Speaker 2>in this murky pond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But someone like Reza Aslan,</v>

1105
00:52:17.331 --> 00:52:18.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1106
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:21.030
<v Speaker 2>he is a kind of a public figure now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1107
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:21.913
<v Speaker 2>he's a darling of a certain segment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media and so what he says actually </v>

1108
00:52:29.541 --> 00:52:31.610
<v Speaker 2>matters because it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1109
00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.660
<v Speaker 2>he's promulgating genuine falsehoods </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the,</v>

1110
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.593
<v Speaker 2>the connection between religious ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a very dangerous behavior and </v>

1111
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:42.194
<v Speaker 2>he's does it it with a apparently clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience and I think he knows enough </v>

1112
00:52:46.251 --> 00:52:48.230
<v Speaker 2>to know that he's actually line.</v>

1113
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.590
<v Speaker 2>So he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

1114
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:53.000
<v Speaker 2>I view him as a truly bad actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1115
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.590
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1116
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:55.423
<v Speaker 2>but it's incredibly boring to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>poking fun at funded him or to keep </v>

1117
00:52:59.391 --> 00:53:00.710
<v Speaker 2>pushing back against what I said</v>

1118
00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:01.663
<v Speaker 1>and then ultimately you're just getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them clicks and in some cases actual </v>

1119
00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:05.930
<v Speaker 1>money too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of,</v>

1120
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I guess there is no answer yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1121
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'll just do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1122
00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I do it when I can't do otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I move on to other things.</v>

1123
00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:14.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get back into some of the </v>

1124
00:53:15.641 --> 00:53:17.650
<v Speaker 1>religious stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1125
00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:18.693
<v Speaker 1>so I think partly what a lot of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>detractors would say is that you have </v>

1126
00:53:23.201 --> 00:53:24.034
<v Speaker 1>this focus on Islam that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've already illustrated and </v>

1127
00:53:26.611 --> 00:53:27.444
<v Speaker 1>you've written a book about Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole half first half of </v>

1128
00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.153
<v Speaker 1>interfaith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talking about the Crusades or all </v>

1129
00:53:32.311 --> 00:53:34.530
<v Speaker 1>this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you said just a moment ago,</v>

1130
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:37.680
<v Speaker 1>you said all kinds of things about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthodox Jews.</v>

1131
00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:41.670
<v Speaker 1>So I think we get a sense that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just that,</v>

1132
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.180
<v Speaker 1>but they're not all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that a lot of these,</v>

1133
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.190
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the progressives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these people on the left,</v>

1134
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:48.323
<v Speaker 1>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe in this idea that </v>

1135
00:53:49.711 --> 00:53:50.544
<v Speaker 1>everything is equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just this sort of base equality </v>

1136
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.490
<v Speaker 1>except the fact is by definition these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are different.</v>

1137
00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:57.324
<v Speaker 1>If I was to right now draw the Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 1>god of Yahweh or Moses or something and </v>

1138
00:54:02.161 --> 00:54:07.161
<v Speaker 1>then draw Jesus in a weird sex act and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then draw Mohammed and I'm talking stick</v>

1139
00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:08.520
<v Speaker 1>figures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a good artist.</v>

1140
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Only one of those would cause a threat </v>
<v Speaker 1>to my life.</v>

1141
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:13.410
<v Speaker 1>So those things are not equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1142
00:54:13.411 --> 00:54:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I know they like that proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

1143
00:54:14.891 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a faulty proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1144
00:54:16.351 --> 00:54:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1145
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably brought out in the,</v>

1146
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:23.070
<v Speaker 2>the most elegant way by that onion </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoon.</v>

1147
00:54:23.071 --> 00:54:23.904
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw that the title </v>
<v Speaker 2>was no one was murdered over this </v>

1148
00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:27.980
<v Speaker 2>cartoon and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1149
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.651
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1150
00:54:28.651 --> 00:54:31.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Buddha stickiness,</v>

1151
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blowing Jesus.</v>

1152
00:54:34.531 --> 00:54:35.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so like everyone,</v>

1153
00:54:35.341 --> 00:54:39.090
<v Speaker 2>but Muhammad is in there and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is made perfectly.</v>

1154
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.661
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1155
00:54:39.661 --> 00:54:40.494
<v Speaker 2>you can do that and yet you cannot draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>a stick figure of Mohammed without </v>

1156
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:47.090
<v Speaker 2>having your life deranged thereafter by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1157
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.840
<v Speaker 2>conversations with the FBI about how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep your,</v>

1158
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:51.940
<v Speaker 2>your you and your family safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1159
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:55.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the reality of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're living in the West right now.</v>

1160
00:54:55.681 --> 00:54:56.514
<v Speaker 2>Forget about what's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to live in Pakistan or </v>

1161
00:54:57.721 --> 00:54:58.554
<v Speaker 2>Bangladesh or any of these countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you are literally going to be cut </v>

1162
00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:06.690
<v Speaker 2>down by your neighbors on the mere rumor</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have mistreated a Koran or that</v>

1163
00:55:06.691 --> 00:55:08.760
<v Speaker 2>you don't believe that it's the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>word of the creator,</v>

1164
00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:10.260
<v Speaker 2>of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1165
00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:12.550
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1166
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:13.733
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this,</v>

1167
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:15.343
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crucial piece is that beliefs </v>

1168
00:55:17.641 --> 00:55:20.310
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific beliefs matter,</v>

1169
00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:23.420
<v Speaker 2>the differences between beliefs matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doctrines,</v>

1170
00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.633
<v Speaker 2>a religious doctrines are not all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same and therefore the behavioral and </v>

1171
00:55:28.231 --> 00:55:32.100
<v Speaker 2>political and moral commitments born of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those doctrines are not all the same.</v>

1172
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.780
<v Speaker 1>How has media really failed this year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1173
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:37.440
<v Speaker 1>the mainstream media?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I did a video a couple of months</v>

1174
00:55:37.441 --> 00:55:37.801
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1175
00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:38.634
<v Speaker 1>there was this exhibition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was somewhere in the middle </v>

1176
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>of the country where they had the pope </v>
<v Speaker 1>made out of condoms.</v>

1177
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Now I can see that being offensive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some Christians,</v>

1178
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:47.544
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could turn on family guy on any </v>

1179
00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:53.550
<v Speaker 1>given night or South Park and see Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing all sorts of crazy things.</v>

1180
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I posted a clip of Jesus bathing naked </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of Stewie,</v>

1181
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:59.010
<v Speaker 1>a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a male baby,</v>

1182
00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:00.780
<v Speaker 1>and they're playing porn music in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

1183
00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no threat of anything.</v>

1184
00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:03.923
<v Speaker 1>So is this where sort of the media has </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of helped the narrative because </v>

1185
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:13.340
<v Speaker 1>they have no problem publishing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of the pope in condoms,</v>

1186
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:15.510
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

1187
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.373
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post the Charlie Hebdo cartoons and is </v>

1188
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:19.074
<v Speaker 1>this also where secular people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've sort of maybe we've </v>

1189
00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 1>underestimated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not been kind</v>

1190
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.053
<v Speaker 2>enough to the mainstream Christians </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they get crap all the time as </v>

1191
00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm illustrating right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's being shot for things.</v>

1192
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think we just have to acknowledge</v>

1193
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:38.650
<v Speaker 2>publicly and loudly and incessantly that</v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech has to win.</v>

1194
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:43.830
<v Speaker 2>So if anyone who in the wake of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Hebdo massacre wondered,</v>

1195
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:46.781
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

1196
00:56:46.781 --> 00:56:49.480
<v Speaker 2>where are those cartoons at all racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that,</v>

1197
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.820
<v Speaker 2>that was going to make me feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently about it.</v>

1198
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:52.803
<v Speaker 2>That opening that door is just a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral blindness that we should have </v>

1199
00:56:57.251 --> 00:57:00.700
<v Speaker 2>immediately a later itself against me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just.</v>

1200
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 2>And people like Glenn Greenwald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1201
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:04.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the door they open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1202
00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these were.</v>

1203
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.210
<v Speaker 2>These were not kosher cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were racist.</v>

1204
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Of course they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1205
00:57:09.761 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 2>if you understood anything about French </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

1206
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:13.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these were,</v>

1207
00:57:13.001 --> 00:57:13.834
<v Speaker 2>these were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people were on the right side of </v>

1208
00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:17.680
<v Speaker 2>all these liberal questions in France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1209
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.800
<v Speaker 2>if you understood and by the culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on Islam more than any more.</v>

1210
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:25.710
<v Speaker 2>We're about Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of stuff.</v>

1211
00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:28.940
<v Speaker 2>But even the cartoons that's on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>face seemed racist and they were kind of</v>

1212
00:57:28.941 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 2>a racial caricature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1213
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:31.654
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you understood the context weren't </v>

1214
00:57:32.801 --> 00:57:33.634
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1215
00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nevermind that the,</v>

1216
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.150
<v Speaker 2>the sense that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1217
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.073
<v Speaker 2>it's the sense that there's a tension </v>
<v Speaker 2>between freedom of religion and freedom </v>

1218
00:57:42.371 --> 00:57:43.204
<v Speaker 2>of speech is a total moral and political</v>
<v Speaker 2>illusion is that there's absolutely </v>

1219
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:48.814
<v Speaker 2>nothing you and I could say in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation that infringes upon </v>

1220
00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:56.260
<v Speaker 2>somebody else's freedom of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can disparage religion all we want.</v>

1221
00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:00.790
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't affect someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>political rights to practice it.</v>

1222
00:58:00.791 --> 00:58:02.470
<v Speaker 2>They can raise their kids however they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

1223
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.313
<v Speaker 2>We simply need to admit that religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be subjected to the same kind of </v>

1224
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:12.320
<v Speaker 2>criticism and scrutiny and satire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1225
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.560
<v Speaker 2>as any other set of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you point out,</v>

1226
00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:15.423
<v Speaker 2>we do this for something like mormonism </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you can have a play like the </v>

1227
00:58:18.401 --> 00:58:20.580
<v Speaker 2>book of Mormon and no one gets killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1228
00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:21.483
<v Speaker 2>It's unthinkable to have an analogous </v>
<v Speaker 2>play about Islam and we have just </v>

1229
00:58:25.271 --> 00:58:27.670
<v Speaker 2>acquiesced to that difference we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so you know,</v>

1230
00:58:27.671 --> 00:58:28.211
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1231
00:58:28.211 --> 00:58:29.044
<v Speaker 2>it's too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is not that it's too </v>

1232
00:58:31.811 --> 00:58:33.850
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that anyone like me would</v>

1233
00:58:33.851 --> 00:58:34.720
<v Speaker 2>want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1234
00:58:34.721 --> 00:58:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Anyone liked someone like Trey Parker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt Stone,</v>

1235
00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:39.040
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those assholes,</v>

1236
00:58:39.041 --> 00:58:41.380
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't go after Islam.</v>

1237
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:42.243
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the moral sense that the </v>

1238
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:45.610
<v Speaker 2>sensibilities of liberals seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1239
00:58:45.611 --> 00:58:46.444
<v Speaker 2>Whereas we should be acknowledging how </v>
<v Speaker 2>excruciating it is that there is this </v>

1240
00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:52.144
<v Speaker 2>difference even in our own societies </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Islam and something like </v>

1241
00:58:55.811 --> 00:58:56.290
<v Speaker 2>mormonism.</v>

1242
00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Whereas at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1243
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:01.223
<v Speaker 2>in one of my blog posts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pointed out that the Mormon response </v>

1244
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:06.400
<v Speaker 2>to the book of Mormon was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was adorable.</v>

1245
00:59:06.401 --> 00:59:09.550
<v Speaker 2>They took out ads for mormonism in </v>
<v Speaker 2>playbill,</v>

1246
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly as it should be.</v>

1247
00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:12.781
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1248
00:59:12.781 --> 00:59:17.140
<v Speaker 2>and I say just incredibly withering </v>
<v Speaker 2>things about mormonism,</v>

1249
00:59:17.141 --> 00:59:19.800
<v Speaker 2>but that no one is no more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1250
00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:20.643
<v Speaker 2>It's going to kill me for it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is a difference that we know </v>

1251
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:24.703
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like Glenn Greenwald and Reza </v>

1252
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Aslan are maintaining the status quo </v>
<v Speaker 2>actively,</v>

1253
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.843
<v Speaker 2>energetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have the moderates and you talk </v>

1254
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:35.114
<v Speaker 2>about this and end of faith that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the supposed moderates in this </v>

1255
00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:38.361
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1256
00:59:38.361 --> 00:59:39.194
<v Speaker 2>And they're in their liberal apologists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their secular liberal politics who </v>

1257
00:59:41.481 --> 00:59:44.090
<v Speaker 2>are not even religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Glenn Glenn is a gauge you,</v>

1258
00:59:44.091 --> 00:59:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it wouldn't go that well</v>
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>

1259
00:59:45.801 --> 00:59:47.930
<v Speaker 2>It was already walking down the street </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Saudi Arabia.</v>

1260
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:51.080
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a Gad your previous guest,</v>

1261
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:54.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once tweeted in response to something,</v>

1262
00:59:54.081 --> 00:59:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Glenn Greenwald tweeted about me know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending Islam.</v>

1263
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:58.610
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1264
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.070
<v Speaker 2>I think this was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It he'll correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

1265
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:03.320
<v Speaker 2>but he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do me a favor,</v>

1266
01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.173
<v Speaker 2>Glen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a shirt made saying I'm gay and I </v>

1267
01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:08.970
<v Speaker 2>don't believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1268
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.290
<v Speaker 2>and travel around the Middle East and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and report back on your adventures.</v>

1269
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.450
<v Speaker 2>There's one place he could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1270
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:15.284
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to that place in a second </v>

1271
01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:16.874
<v Speaker 2>because we're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go controversial if you </v>

1272
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:18.824
<v Speaker 2>don't think we've gotten there so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought what we could do here for a </v>

1273
01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:23.380
<v Speaker 2>second is because I know that people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna.</v>

1274
01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Say you guys are focused on Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're focusing on Islam.</v>

1275
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Can you just give me a bunch of bad shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Christianity and Judaism?</v>

1276
01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:32.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just rip it apart.</v>

1277
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Just Gimme I know you can do it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I read the books,</v>

1278
01:00:34.851 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 2>but just as telling me some really </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible stuff.</v>

1279
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the level of the text,</v>

1280
01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.810
<v Speaker 2>at the level of what's just in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>

1281
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.990
<v Speaker 2>that is the worst book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is worse than the Koran.</v>

1282
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1283
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.333
<v Speaker 2>it is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most barbaric and theocratic a </v>

1284
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:56.950
<v Speaker 2>recipe for human unhappiness talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Old Testament Judaism and clear to</v>

1285
01:00:58.611 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 2>some degree Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes.</v>

1286
01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1287
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:04.183
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you as a Jew wanted to live out of </v>

1288
01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:08.510
<v Speaker 2>leviticus and Deuteronomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1289
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:10.310
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1290
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:11.480
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1291
01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:15.500
<v Speaker 2>write of Mullah Omar in terms of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>theocratic commitments right now.</v>

1292
01:01:15.501 --> 01:01:16.334
<v Speaker 2>It just so happens there are reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 2>even ultra orthodox Jews aren't </v>

1293
01:01:20.091 --> 01:01:21.980
<v Speaker 2>committed to the letter of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1294
01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:23.640
<v Speaker 2>but they're not good reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

1295
01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.270
<v Speaker 2>they're just kind of accidental </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical reasons.</v>

1296
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:27.710
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually a,</v>

1297
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:28.603
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1298
01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.650
<v Speaker 2>a encounter I brief briefly relate in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>new book with the Majid Nawaz.</v>

1299
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while we're talking,</v>

1300
01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:37.663
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to him about how I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>always worried when I see sort of </v>

1301
01:01:40.521 --> 01:01:45.521
<v Speaker 2>carefully worded seemingly moderate </v>
<v Speaker 2>claims from religious people because you</v>

1302
01:01:45.651 --> 01:01:46.484
<v Speaker 2>sensed that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there they're doing some kind of </v>

1303
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.033
<v Speaker 2>theological correction in their brains </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's covering for other </v>

1304
01:01:52.221 --> 01:01:55.070
<v Speaker 2>commitments that they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being so forthcoming about it.</v>

1305
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:58.430
<v Speaker 2>And I wants discovered this with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Orthodox Jew at a wedding.</v>

1306
01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.170
<v Speaker 2>He was a friend of the groom and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1307
01:02:00.171 --> 01:02:01.004
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were introduced and then the groom </v>

1308
01:02:02.451 --> 01:02:06.770
<v Speaker 2>walked away and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just kind of launched into my spiel</v>

1309
01:02:06.771 --> 01:02:07.210
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1310
01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:10.410
<v Speaker 2>just tell me what about all the barbers </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and leviticus and Deuteronomy and</v>

1311
01:02:10.411 --> 01:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>how do you reconcile those things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1312
01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:13.611
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1313
01:02:13.611 --> 01:02:16.880
<v Speaker 2>it was very interesting that all of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just in the context of the time.</v>

1314
01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.420
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't apply now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no sand hedren,</v>

1315
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:22.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no body of elders who,</v>

1316
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:25.430
<v Speaker 2>who would make all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1317
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:27.420
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1318
01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 2>and I could see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could hear what he was doing there.</v>

1319
01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:30.130
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1320
01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:30.721
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1321
01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:31.554
<v Speaker 2>but when the Messiah comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you think he will and you reconvene </v>

1322
01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:37.440
<v Speaker 2>the Sanhedrin in the temple is rebuilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what you know,</v>

1323
01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.293
<v Speaker 2>then are you stoning people to death for</v>
<v Speaker 2>adultery in witchcraft and </v>

1324
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:42.120
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1325
01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.681
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1326
01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:44.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fair.</v>

1327
01:02:44.851 --> 01:02:47.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a very hard question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

1328
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:48.930
<v Speaker 2>and then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1329
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:52.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can appreciate how,</v>

1330
01:02:52.381 --> 01:02:53.214
<v Speaker 2>what a sacrilege those behaviors would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the presence of the Messiah and a </v>

1331
01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:00.230
<v Speaker 2>properly concentrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consecrated,</v>

1332
01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Sanhedrin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1333
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:02.461
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1334
01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:03.420
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1335
01:03:03.421 --> 01:03:03.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

1336
01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:06.270
<v Speaker 2>aware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what part of your body should I vomit on</v>

1337
01:03:06.271 --> 01:03:06.480
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

1338
01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:06.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1339
01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:08.170
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the.</v>

1340
01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.500
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the know,</v>

1341
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:15.210
<v Speaker 2>if you just push long enough you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>find the theocrat in those people.</v>

1342
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a matter of fact,</v>

1343
01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:19.973
<v Speaker 2>there they have theological reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to be stoning people to </v>

1344
01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:27.030
<v Speaker 2>death for homosexuality and adultery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now we're working on the sabbath,</v>

1345
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Though those rules are,</v>

1346
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 2>are mandated in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Old Testament.</v>

1347
01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:33.950
<v Speaker 2>But there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1348
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:39.020
<v Speaker 2>there are possible circumstances where a</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion like Christianity or Judaism is</v>

1349
01:03:41.131 --> 01:03:43.850
<v Speaker 2>more dangerous than Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just we don't happen to be as,</v>

1350
01:03:43.851 --> 01:03:44.684
<v Speaker 2>as a global matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't happen to be in those </v>

1351
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.123
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you take something like stem </v>

1352
01:03:48.361 --> 01:03:49.110
<v Speaker 2>cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1353
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:52.820
<v Speaker 2>this just comes down to the specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of specific beliefs.</v>

1354
01:03:52.821 --> 01:03:56.460
<v Speaker 2>So Islam is totally off the hook with </v>
<v Speaker 2>embryonic stem cell research.</v>

1355
01:03:56.461 --> 01:03:57.294
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't think that the soul enters </v>

1356
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:01.080
<v Speaker 2>the Zygote at the moment of conception.</v>

1357
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.950
<v Speaker 2>They think it enters that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's day eight or day 1:20,</v>

1358
01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.630
<v Speaker 2>depending on what you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which had either you believe.</v>

1359
01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:07.771
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1360
01:04:07.771 --> 01:04:08.604
<v Speaker 2>when I go on and on about religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the religious impediment to lifesaving </v>

1361
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:15.510
<v Speaker 2>medical research and on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in embryonic stem cell research,</v>

1362
01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:16.763
<v Speaker 2>I'm never thinking about Islam right as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just as long as it's compatible </v>

1363
01:04:20.131 --> 01:04:20.964
<v Speaker 2>with Islam right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isis could be doing embryonic stem cell </v>

1364
01:04:23.221 --> 01:04:24.520
<v Speaker 2>research if they wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1365
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.153
<v Speaker 2>so you just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be honest about who is </v>

1366
01:04:28.411 --> 01:04:28.910
<v Speaker 2>culpa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1367
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:33.630
<v Speaker 2>what ideas and what and what advocates </v>
<v Speaker 2>if those ideas are culpable for specific</v>

1368
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:34.523
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1369
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.950
<v Speaker 2>So I'm pretty sure you're saying we just</v>
<v Speaker 2>proved your an anti Semite yes.</v>

1370
01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:38.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1371
01:04:38.361 --> 01:04:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

1372
01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:40.453
<v Speaker 2>I've been blamed a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a passage in the end of faith </v>

1373
01:04:42.451 --> 01:04:47.451
<v Speaker 2>that if you read it on charitably seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to blame the Holocaust on the Jews.</v>

1374
01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:48.391
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1375
01:04:48.391 --> 01:04:50.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought that as I do.</v>

1376
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:52.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1377
01:04:52.561 --> 01:04:53.350
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1378
01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:54.183
<v Speaker 2>it's an honest fact that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a 2000 year history of </v>

1379
01:04:59.371 --> 01:05:00.204
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to some degree Jews have </v>

1380
01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:08.361
<v Speaker 2>collaborated in by being an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>insular culture,</v>

1381
01:05:08.761 --> 01:05:09.594
<v Speaker 2>religious culture that dogmatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>define themselves in opposition to the </v>

1382
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.840
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1383
01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:17.970
<v Speaker 2>the non Jewish culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's two sides of a coin,</v>

1384
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:19.660
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't excuse the Holocaust,</v>

1385
01:05:19.661 --> 01:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>doesn't blame Jews for the Holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

1386
01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:22.684
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then I saw the conception of Jews </v>

1387
01:05:25.961 --> 01:05:28.780
<v Speaker 2>as Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a race is shared by Jews,</v>

1388
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:29.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1389
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:30.543
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't been foisted on them by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside world and that's why it's a </v>

1390
01:05:33.761 --> 01:05:34.391
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1391
01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:37.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you have to get out of this game of,</v>

1392
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:42.710
<v Speaker 2>of defining ourselves tribally based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>imaginary in a fictitious ideas.</v>

1393
01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:44.763
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have to realize that the way </v>

1394
01:05:47.321 --> 01:05:50.890
<v Speaker 2>forward is recognizing our common </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>

1395
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.753
<v Speaker 2>It were a single species on a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet trying to build a single viable </v>

1396
01:05:55.481 --> 01:05:56.314
<v Speaker 2>global civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are a thousand different ways </v>

1397
01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:01.720
<v Speaker 2>we can screw this up and not so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways where we can,</v>

1398
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:05.380
<v Speaker 2>we can build paradise on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which should be our common project.</v>

1399
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1400
01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:06.853
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our definition of paradise and </v>

1401
01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>some of the people that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about me,</v>

1402
01:06:09.531 --> 01:06:10.364
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that may not be exactly the same </v>

1403
01:06:11.181 --> 01:06:11.360
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1404
01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem you have.</v>

1405
01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hence the power,</v>

1406
01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.753
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crucial matter of criticizing bad </v>

1407
01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.860
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

1408
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:25.370
<v Speaker 2>most people think there's a lot of bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>people running around in the world.</v>

1409
01:06:25.371 --> 01:06:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't a lot of bad people.</v>

1410
01:06:26.871 --> 01:06:27.704
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of bad ideas and bad </v>

1411
01:06:29.961 --> 01:06:32.720
<v Speaker 2>ideas are worse than bad people because </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad ideas are contagious.</v>

1412
01:06:32.721 --> 01:06:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Bad ideas get good people to do horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1413
01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:35.890
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1414
01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:36.723
<v Speaker 1>you wrote what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I think it was on your podcast </v>

1415
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:39.880
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I read the transcript,</v>

1416
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:45.750
<v Speaker 1>what I think is the most tepid defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Israel that has ever been said ever.</v>

1417
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.940
<v Speaker 1>But because of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think you're a Zionist.</v>

1418
01:06:48.941 --> 01:06:51.160
<v Speaker 1>You're secretly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said earlier,</v>

1419
01:06:51.161 --> 01:06:51.651
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1420
01:06:51.651 --> 01:06:53.470
<v Speaker 1>you're manipulating things and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1421
01:06:53.471 --> 01:06:55.630
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you've talked about dragging</v>

1422
01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.930
<v Speaker 1>settlers by their beards out of the West</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bank and all of this stuff.</v>

1423
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we only have about 10 minutes?</v>

1424
01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in about five minutes,</v>

1425
01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:07.300
<v Speaker 1>can you just sort of sum up that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about?</v>

1426
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't even really view it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense in a weird way.</v>

1427
01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

1428
01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:13.323
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't agree with all of it by any </v>

1429
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:15.550
<v Speaker 1>stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I defend Israel.</v>

1430
01:07:15.551 --> 01:07:17.740
<v Speaker 1>It's the one tiny little democracy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of the road,</v>

1431
01:07:17.741 --> 01:07:20.160
<v Speaker 1>which you sort of alluded to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1432
01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:21.880
<v Speaker 1>so can you just sort of sum that up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1433
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:26.881
<v Speaker 1>and then also why then even the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>tepid defense means you're automatically</v>

1434
01:07:26.981 --> 01:07:29.200
<v Speaker 1>on design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Design is Nazi,</v>

1435
01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:29.940
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1436
01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:30.773
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the worst titled Blog Post </v>

1437
01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.650
<v Speaker 2>podcast ever because people read it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1438
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:39.140
<v Speaker 2>the title was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't I criticize Israel?</v>

1439
01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Question mark a and immediately I </v>

1440
01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:46.010
<v Speaker 2>reminded my readers and listeners that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>do criticize Israel,</v>

1441
01:07:46.011 --> 01:07:47.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was read as,</v>

1442
01:07:47.721 --> 01:07:48.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1443
01:07:48.441 --> 01:07:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I am committed to not criticizing Israel</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of x,</v>

1444
01:07:51.321 --> 01:07:52.154
<v Speaker 2>Y,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and z.</v>

1445
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.290
<v Speaker 2>So I do criticize Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1446
01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:58.740
<v Speaker 2>I say in that piece that I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it should exist as a Jewish state.</v>

1447
01:07:58.741 --> 01:07:59.574
<v Speaker 2>And I think I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I think the idea of estate organized </v>

1448
01:08:02.061 --> 01:08:02.894
<v Speaker 2>around a religion is just intrinsically </v>
<v Speaker 2>of noxious and divisive and </v>

1449
01:08:05.451 --> 01:08:06.530
<v Speaker 2>unsustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1450
01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:07.573
<v Speaker 2>with the one caveat that the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that justifies the existence of Israel </v>

1451
01:08:10.521 --> 01:08:11.354
<v Speaker 2>as a Jewish state is the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world has rather reliably </v>

1452
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:17.900
<v Speaker 2>his willingness to murder the Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>outright.</v>

1453
01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:18.620
<v Speaker 2>For being Jewish.</v>

1454
01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.840
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no other people who are,</v>

1455
01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:24.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out of this legacy of having been</v>

1456
01:08:24.141 --> 01:08:29.141
<v Speaker 2>hunted and hounded for generations until</v>
<v Speaker 2>antiquity,</v>

1457
01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

1458
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:33.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1459
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:36.620
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's understandable that many,</v>

1460
01:08:36.621 --> 01:08:39.740
<v Speaker 2>many Jews think we need a Jewish state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1461
01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.420
<v Speaker 2>and I don't deny that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>

1462
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:43.910
<v Speaker 2>it's not a state that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1463
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:46.010
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an ethnicity that is.</v>

1464
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Judaism is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a religion,</v>

1465
01:08:48.121 --> 01:08:48.954
<v Speaker 2>so it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a Jewish state and quite the </v>

1466
01:08:50.121 --> 01:08:53.870
<v Speaker 2>same way that the Saudi Arabia is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic state.</v>

1467
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:55.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not religious in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1468
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I like bagels and I watch curb your </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm so I get.</v>

1469
01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.970
<v Speaker 2>So I'm you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on precisely that sort of Jew.</v>

1470
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I like Israel.</v>

1471
01:09:03.311 --> 01:09:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I been to Israel and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1472
01:09:05.421 --> 01:09:06.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1473
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I've loved my time there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1474
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.930
<v Speaker 2>but if all the Jews woke up tomorrow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1475
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't worth it.</v>

1476
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Let's just assimilate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just,</v>

1477
01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:16.700
<v Speaker 2>let's just blend into the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1478
01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:17.563
<v Speaker 2>This is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this godforsaken piece of land is let's </v>

1479
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.200
<v Speaker 2>give it to the Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1480
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.300
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing</v>

1481
01:09:26.301 --> 01:09:27.134
<v Speaker 2>if the Jews were the first religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>congregation on earth to admit that </v>

1482
01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:33.180
<v Speaker 2>religion as a variable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1483
01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:34.063
<v Speaker 2>as a device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>divisive variable was just defunct and </v>

1484
01:09:36.591 --> 01:09:38.910
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to be human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a,</v>

1485
01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:41.720
<v Speaker 2>as a closing chapter to Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be the,</v>

1486
01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.920
<v Speaker 2>I'd be honored to be among those Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Poles are sort of showing that,</v>

1487
01:09:45.921 --> 01:09:46.754
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean most Jews are secular or </v>

1488
01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:49.210
<v Speaker 2>religious in any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1489
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:51.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing about Judaism now</v>

1490
01:09:51.111 --> 01:09:51.944
<v Speaker 2>is that it's very hard to find Jews who </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe anything superstitious in the </v>

1491
01:09:55.311 --> 01:09:56.144
<v Speaker 2>service of their Judaism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've debate conservative rabbis who </v>

1492
01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.353
<v Speaker 2>don't even believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they believe or the God they </v>

1493
01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:03.310
<v Speaker 2>believe in is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1494
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:05.840
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics or just pure energy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>ms dot.</v>

1495
01:10:05.841 --> 01:10:09.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not a god who can hear prayers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the force with.</v>

1496
01:10:09.771 --> 01:10:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1497
01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I've met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met that rabbi.</v>

1498
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:12.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1499
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:16.410
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a uh,</v>

1500
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:19.220
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my bias toward Israel,</v>

1501
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.173
<v Speaker 2>whenever you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict between Israel and her </v>

1502
01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:23.834
<v Speaker 2>neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my biased towards Israel is really a </v>

1503
01:10:25.911 --> 01:10:26.744
<v Speaker 2>bias against suicide bombing and the use</v>
<v Speaker 2>of human shields and an explicitly </v>

1504
01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:37.910
<v Speaker 2>genocidal aspiration which Hamas has in </v>
<v Speaker 2>its charter and many,</v>

1505
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:42.990
<v Speaker 2>many of Israel's antagonists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ha,</v>

1506
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:46.310
<v Speaker 2>have just in the way they talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fate of the Jews.</v>

1507
01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is prophesized that,</v>

1508
01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:48.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1509
01:10:48.451 --> 01:10:49.284
<v Speaker 2>the end times will come when the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth cries out against the Jews were </v>

1510
01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:56.690
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were the trees and the rocks say there's</v>

1511
01:10:56.691 --> 01:10:58.250
<v Speaker 2>a Jew behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come kill him.</v>

1512
01:10:58.251 --> 01:10:59.084
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

1513
01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:03.050
<v Speaker 2>that is the center of the fairway </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic Prophecy,</v>

1514
01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:04.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1515
01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.890
<v Speaker 2>and it's in the charter of Hamas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1516
01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:10.280
<v Speaker 2>So how can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can Israel expect to deal with these</v>

1517
01:11:10.281 --> 01:11:11.030
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1518
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 2>So I think you illustrated in that piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if the</v>

1519
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:14.873
<v Speaker 1>weapons were reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the Israelis had the weapons that </v>

1520
01:11:18.481 --> 01:11:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Hamas has and Hamas or the weapons he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really had,</v>

1521
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:21.383
<v Speaker 1>well this thing would be over tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there would be a genocide </v>

1522
01:11:23.011 --> 01:11:26.650
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which to me sort of sums up the white</v>

1523
01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:28.800
<v Speaker 2>yes conversation that's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the,</v>

1524
01:11:28.801 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1525
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:31.103
<v Speaker 2>the moral disparity that all of Israel's</v>
<v Speaker 2>critics have to admit to be </v>

1526
01:11:34.951 --> 01:11:35.784
<v Speaker 2>intellectually honest here and just says</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel is showing what they would do if </v>

1527
01:11:40.591 --> 01:11:41.424
<v Speaker 2>they could kill all their enemies </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow because they could kill all </v>

1528
01:11:43.471 --> 01:11:44.304
<v Speaker 2>their enemies tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could go into Gaza and kill </v>

1529
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.800
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're not doing it.</v>

1530
01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.000
<v Speaker 2>You might cynically think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1531
01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:48.973
<v Speaker 2>they're just not doing that because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world would be so horrified </v>

1532
01:11:50.731 --> 01:11:53.760
<v Speaker 2>and treat them like even more like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pariah state.</v>

1533
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:54.763
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're not being restrained by any </v>

1534
01:11:56.731 --> 01:11:58.860
<v Speaker 2>commitment to human rights or anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else notable.</v>

1535
01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:03.360
<v Speaker 2>They're just as pure self serving a </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculation,</v>

1536
01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:07.770
<v Speaker 2>but still they're not committing </v>
<v Speaker 2>genocide.</v>

1537
01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:08.604
<v Speaker 2>And yet you have have people on the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>claiming that what they did in Gaza was </v>

1538
01:12:11.341 --> 01:12:12.174
<v Speaker 2>a genocide right</v>

1539
01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.030
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their population goes up every year.</v>

1540
01:12:14.031 --> 01:12:14.864
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweet that people all the time when </v>

1541
01:12:15.621 --> 01:12:16.454
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying someone tweeted at you </v>

1542
01:12:16.881 --> 01:12:17.900
<v Speaker 1>saying about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1543
01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:19.220
<v Speaker 1>why don't you call it genocide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote,</v>

1544
01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:20.163
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1545
01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:23.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know it's,</v>

1546
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:24.563
<v Speaker 2>it's they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in a horrible and increasingly </v>

1547
01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:31.580
<v Speaker 2>untenable situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're dealing with people.</v>

1548
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:32.623
<v Speaker 2>Some set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some significant subset of whom support </v>

1549
01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.753
<v Speaker 2>the targeting of innocence through </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicidal terrorism in defense of </v>

1550
01:12:43.431 --> 01:12:44.630
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In,</v>

1551
01:12:44.631 --> 01:12:45.464
<v Speaker 2>not in this is this has flown the perch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mere politics and mirror claims upon </v>

1552
01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:52.763
<v Speaker 2>a know scarce resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about religious </v>

1553
01:12:55.161 --> 01:12:56.780
<v Speaker 2>attachments to holy site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1554
01:12:56.781 --> 01:12:58.310
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the dome of the Rock,</v>

1555
01:12:58.311 --> 01:12:59.210
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the Alex,</v>

1556
01:12:59.211 --> 01:13:04.211
<v Speaker 2>a mosque was destroyed as some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians and crazy Jews want to figure</v>

1557
01:13:04.641 --> 01:13:05.890
<v Speaker 2>out how to accomplish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are,</v>

1558
01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.610
<v Speaker 2>there are people who want to bomb that </v>
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>

1559
01:13:07.611 --> 01:13:10.430
<v Speaker 2>right to usher in the second coming of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

1560
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:11.303
<v Speaker 2>Or if that building were destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would see just an all out a attempt </v>

1561
01:13:18.891 --> 01:13:21.410
<v Speaker 2>at genocide from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Muslim world.</v>

1562
01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1563
01:13:23.481 --> 01:13:26.630
<v Speaker 2>based entirely on the religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolism of,</v>

1564
01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:31.040
<v Speaker 2>of just a pile of rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the situation we're in.</v>

1565
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a lot of thought to it.</v>

1566
01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:34.240
<v Speaker 1>How do I want to end this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1567
01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read your other Book Waking Up,</v>

1568
01:13:35.951 --> 01:13:39.370
<v Speaker 1>which is a guide to spirituality without</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

1569
01:13:39.630 --> 01:13:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And as I've sat across from you for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half now,</v>

1570
01:13:41.621 --> 01:13:45.820
<v Speaker 1>you seem to be extremely at peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to you,</v>

1571
01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:47.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your interview with Jake,</v>

1572
01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.273
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of ranting and raving on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his side and papers flying everywhere </v>

1573
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:51.403
<v Speaker 1>and you sat there pretty much like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting here right now and you </v>

1574
01:13:54.461 --> 01:13:57.970
<v Speaker 1>commonly approach all these things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think in a very admirable way.</v>

1575
01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

1576
01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:00.593
<v Speaker 1>I've read the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what are some of the tactics that </v>

1577
01:14:03.401 --> 01:14:04.234
<v Speaker 1>you use to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tap into that spirituality side to </v>

1578
01:14:07.301 --> 01:14:08.134
<v Speaker 1>get all this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we've talked about a lot of </v>

1579
01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>noise and once we post these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what twitter is gonna look like.</v>

1580
01:14:12.761 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And I know what the comments are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to look like,</v>

1581
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 1>how do you find some peace within all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1582
01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:19.024
<v Speaker 1>and then within everything else that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in your personal life and </v>

1583
01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:24.040
<v Speaker 1>everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you sort of get to that space?</v>

1584
01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.470
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Practice Meditation,</v>

1585
01:14:25.471 --> 01:14:29.520
<v Speaker 2>which is just paying close attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your experience in the present moment.</v>

1586
01:14:29.521 --> 01:14:32.670
<v Speaker 2>So if you do pay close attention to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

1587
01:14:32.671 --> 01:14:33.504
<v Speaker 2>you'll notice that you have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition of consciousness which is </v>

1588
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.863
<v Speaker 2>subjectively speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we'll learn about it at the </v>

1589
01:14:41.551 --> 01:14:44.490
<v Speaker 2>level of the brain at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subjectively speaking,</v>

1590
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.333
<v Speaker 2>it's intrinsically mysterious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what this is or how this </v>

1591
01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:50.880
<v Speaker 2>is arising subjectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't,</v>

1592
01:14:50.881 --> 01:14:51.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact you don't even know you have a </v>

1593
01:14:52.411 --> 01:14:54.170
<v Speaker 2>brain subjectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1594
01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:55.403
<v Speaker 2>so you have this space of light and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shadow and color and energy and in that </v>

1595
01:14:59.641 --> 01:15:00.474
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and emotions keep arising and </v>

1596
01:15:03.361 --> 01:15:04.194
<v Speaker 2>changing and passing away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the difference between being at </v>

1597
01:15:08.311 --> 01:15:09.144
<v Speaker 2>peace and being starkly miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always a difference between a </v>

1598
01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:16.283
<v Speaker 2>being kind of free of identification </v>
<v Speaker 2>with thought and being totally captured </v>

1599
01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:21.893
<v Speaker 2>by your thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next thought just comes up and you </v>

1600
01:15:24.961 --> 01:15:25.794
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't notice it as a thought and </v>

1601
01:15:27.241 --> 01:15:28.950
<v Speaker 2>it's just all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to become you,</v>

1602
01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:29.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I'm,</v>

1603
01:15:29.911 --> 01:15:31.680
<v Speaker 2>if I have a thought that arises and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1604
01:15:31.681 --> 01:15:33.000
<v Speaker 2>that fucking raise Isilon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1605
01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:36.540
<v Speaker 2>If that trims down consciousness too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1606
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:39.150
<v Speaker 2>that's the entirety of my being in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>

1607
01:15:39.151 --> 01:15:39.984
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the toxicity of our lives is really </v>

1608
01:15:42.631 --> 01:15:43.464
<v Speaker 2>mediated by thought and the moment you </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize it really your mind as the </v>

1609
01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:52.500
<v Speaker 2>level of experience and the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your functioning in the world,</v>

1610
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:54.420
<v Speaker 2>your mind is all you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1611
01:15:54.421 --> 01:15:57.450
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's every relationship you have,</v>

1612
01:15:57.451 --> 01:15:58.284
<v Speaker 2>every experience you have is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>as good or bad as your mind is in that </v>

1613
01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.530
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1614
01:16:04.650 --> 01:16:08.730
<v Speaker 2>and we all have these experiences where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we just kind of slammed into the present</v>

1615
01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:11.220
<v Speaker 2>moment in a very satisfying way based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1616
01:16:11.221 --> 01:16:12.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some heightened experience,</v>

1617
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:15.380
<v Speaker 2>whether you know your bungee jumping or </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1618
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're having sex.</v>

1619
01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:19.110
<v Speaker 2>So we've taken a drug or the some peak </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

1620
01:16:19.111 --> 01:16:23.200
<v Speaker 2>that seat that overrides all of our kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of habitual mediocrity.</v>

1621
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1622
01:16:24.650 --> 01:16:28.830
<v Speaker 2>and gets us to recognize that life can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be beautiful and profound,</v>

1623
01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:35.360
<v Speaker 2>but you can actually take charge of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>process and just train your mind to find</v>

1624
01:16:35.521 --> 01:16:36.354
<v Speaker 2>that profundity in each moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And meditation is just that technique </v>

1625
01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.133
<v Speaker 2>and that the book waking up is my effort</v>
<v Speaker 2>to describe that process and that </v>

1626
01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:45.983
<v Speaker 2>possibility very much in the context of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and without any religious Mumbo </v>

1627
01:16:49.741 --> 01:16:50.360
<v Speaker 2>jumbo.</v>

1628
01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.193
<v Speaker 1>I sense you'd rather spend more time </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about that than some of these </v>

1629
01:16:53.121 --> 01:16:53.954
<v Speaker 1>other stuff too.</v>

1630
01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the irony is so that,</v>

1631
01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.273
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Ben Affleck collision completely </v>

1632
01:16:57.861 --> 01:16:58.694
<v Speaker 2>hijack my book tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a book tour talking about </v>

1633
01:17:00.981 --> 01:17:05.981
<v Speaker 2>meditation and spirituality and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted from that instant thereafter.</v>

1634
01:17:06.711 --> 01:17:07.341
<v Speaker 2>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

1635
01:17:07.341 --> 01:17:08.420
<v Speaker 2>it was just all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1636
01:17:08.421 --> 01:17:10.910
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam all the time.</v>

1637
01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1638
01:17:12.951 --> 01:17:13.491
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1639
01:17:13.491 --> 01:17:15.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just feel like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I view,</v>

1640
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.410
<v Speaker 2>I really do most of my career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly most of my,</v>

1641
01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:23.480
<v Speaker 2>everything I've said about religion as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive opportunity cost.</v>

1642
01:17:23.481 --> 01:17:24.314
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have to say any of these </v>

1643
01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:26.960
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us should have to say or hear or</v>

1644
01:17:26.961 --> 01:17:28.490
<v Speaker 2>contemplate any of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1645
01:17:28.491 --> 01:17:31.180
<v Speaker 2>we just were talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1646
01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.193
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the legacy of these ancient books that </v>

1647
01:17:35.211 --> 01:17:37.700
<v Speaker 2>people think we're not written by human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>

1648
01:17:37.701 --> 01:17:39.500
<v Speaker 2>but we're dictated by the creator of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

1649
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:43.790
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hence they want to throw gays off of</v>

1650
01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:44.624
<v Speaker 2>rooftops and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and force women to live in bags or </v>

1651
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.673
<v Speaker 2>prevent gay marriage in our context or </v>
<v Speaker 2>preventive embryonic stem cell research </v>

1652
01:17:52.281 --> 01:17:53.750
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is.</v>

1653
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:54.583
<v Speaker 2>And so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fighting these ancient battles </v>

1654
01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.710
<v Speaker 2>which we should have outgrown centuries </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1655
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.720
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1656
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:02.961
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

1657
01:18:02.961 --> 01:18:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I see it as a personal opportunity costs</v>
<v Speaker 2>because yeah,</v>

1658
01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:07.070
<v Speaker 2>there are more interesting things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about,</v>

1659
01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.273
<v Speaker 2>but I just see civilizationally we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this one opportunity to make </v>

1660
01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.270
<v Speaker 2>this life beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
01:18:14.271 --> 01:18:16.760
<v Speaker 2>and we have a short life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1662
01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who just died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1663
01:18:18.921 --> 01:18:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I just learned today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1664
01:18:20.001 --> 01:18:21.590
<v Speaker 2>He was my age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1665
01:18:21.591 --> 01:18:23.750
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1666
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his life was whatever he made of it,</v>

1667
01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.010
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he had been,</v>

1668
01:18:28.011 --> 01:18:28.844
<v Speaker 2>he had a final hour and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were all in that same </v>

1669
01:18:31.161 --> 01:18:31.994
<v Speaker 2>circumstance personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're in that circumstance as a </v>

1670
01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.780
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at how we,</v>

1671
01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:39.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1672
01:18:39.801 --> 01:18:40.634
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are real challenges that make </v>

1673
01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.210
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that make it make that a hard project.</v>

1674
01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:45.043
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's disease and there's no </v>

1675
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.353
<v Speaker 2>scientific things we don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really would help us to understand </v>

1676
01:18:50.251 --> 01:18:52.990
<v Speaker 2>and we have environmental problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't,</v>

1677
01:18:52.991 --> 01:18:53.824
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand economy as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to really figure out how to </v>

1678
01:18:57.290 --> 01:19:01.760
<v Speaker 2>prevent bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm recessions and depressions,</v>

1679
01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:06.180
<v Speaker 2>but we have these other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this other area of our lives where we.</v>

1680
01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:10.190
<v Speaker 2>So obviously creating needless human </v>
<v Speaker 2>misery.</v>

1681
01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you look at something like,</v>

1682
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isis or,</v>

1683
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:14.623
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1684
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extreme forms of religion takes.</v>

1685
01:19:17.361 --> 01:19:18.194
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like we're just like lighting </v>

1686
01:19:19.761 --> 01:19:23.420
<v Speaker 2>fire to the wealth of the world for no </v>
<v Speaker 2>good reason.</v>

1687
01:19:23.421 --> 01:19:24.254
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1688
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:27.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a no,</v>

1689
01:19:27.771 --> 01:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate the opportunity to talk for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few minutes about something else,</v>

1690
01:19:30.801 --> 01:19:31.634
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a fact that I do view us </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the midst of a kind of political and </v>

1691
01:19:36.501 --> 01:19:37.334
<v Speaker 2>moral emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I do find myself talking about </v>

1692
01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:42.140
<v Speaker 2>bad ideas more than I talk about good </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>

1693
01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I,</v>

1694
01:19:43.171 --> 01:19:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way and I don't know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many opportunities people get in life to</v>

1695
01:19:46.661 --> 01:19:49.270
<v Speaker 1>talk to somebody that they truly admire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I got here today.</v>

1696
01:19:49.271 --> 01:19:52.400
<v Speaker 1>So I beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

1697
01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1698
01:19:54.221 --> 01:19:55.054
<v Speaker 1>and I hope that at the end of this that </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be something good happened and if </v>

1699
01:19:57.551 --> 01:19:58.530
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1700
01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll do it again or it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fun.</v>

1701
01:20:01.241 --> 01:20:02.260
<v Speaker 1>It was fun to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1702
01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.393
<v Speaker 1>Maybe next time we'll just do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a room that you do the </v>

1703
