00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the l word today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>not that l word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other l word liberal.</v>

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.753
<v Speaker 1>I've always considered myself a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably before I even knew what the </v>

4
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:12.084
<v Speaker 1>word actually meant as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking that liberals were </v>

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:15.744
<v Speaker 1>the good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberals were looking out for other </v>

6
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:18.474
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberals wanted a fair society and </v>

7
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>liberals didn't care about race or </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Before I go any further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys know I love definitions,</v>

9
00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:26.974
<v Speaker 1>so let's actually define the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal according to the Oxford </v>

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

11
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>open to new behavior or opinions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to discard traditional values to</v>

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.753
<v Speaker 1>concerned mainly with broadening a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's general knowledge and </v>

13
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>experience rather than with technical or</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional training.</v>

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.233
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being open to new opinions and </v>

15
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>broadening your knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both seem like good ideas,</v>

16
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With these two definitions in mind,</v>

17
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:54.804
<v Speaker 1>you can understand why liberals have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been on the forefront of the civil </v>

18
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>workers' rights,</v>

19
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>women's rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and marriage equality.</v>

20
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes to get everyone to a place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality,</v>

21
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>you have to throw out the societal norms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be willing to accept a new normal.</v>

22
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives often argue that change </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't good or at least change that comes</v>

23
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.054
<v Speaker 1>to fastest and I think in certain cases </v>
<v Speaker 1>there can be some truth to that </v>

24
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:18.954
<v Speaker 1>mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're the black person sitting </v>

25
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:21.834
<v Speaker 1>in the back of the bus or a woman trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to vote or the gay person who can't get </v>

26
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change can't happen soon enough.</v>

27
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned all of this because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to lose my credit as a real liberal</v>

28
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>since I've had some conservative guests </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Rubin report.</v>

29
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:36.744
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people suddenly calling me or </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative or claiming that I'm a </v>

30
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I've mentioned before,</v>

31
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I've never voted for a Republican for </v>
<v Speaker 1>any major office,</v>

32
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pretty bad one.</v>

33
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.223
<v Speaker 1>Just because I talked to Ben Shapiro or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos or your own Brooke of </v>

34
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.244
<v Speaker 1>the Iron Rand Institute doesn't mean I </v>
<v Speaker 1>share any or all of their beliefs and </v>

35
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the same as when I talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to left leading guests like Jimmy Dore,</v>

36
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Riva Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or my guest this week.</v>

37
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.103
<v Speaker 1>John Fugelsang saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to people push back when I </v>

38
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>see fit and see where the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

39
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.163
<v Speaker 1>I know some of you want me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrocute my guests every time they </v>

40
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>say saying I disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a litany of legal reasons.</v>

41
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>We just can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but beyond the legal reasons.</v>

42
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm a firm believer that good ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>always beat out bad ideas.</v>

43
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>If you let the light shine on both of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

44
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.853
<v Speaker 1>it's not liberal or even decent to shout</v>
<v Speaker 1>down or silence ideas just because you </v>

45
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.254
<v Speaker 1>don't like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has been and always will be the </v>

46
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:34.104
<v Speaker 1>driving force behind the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I view liberal thinking and liberal </v>

47
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.624
<v Speaker 1>ideas as generally good over the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>few months as I've explored classical </v>

48
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>liberalism with its focus on civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberties and economic freedom.</v>

49
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.473
<v Speaker 1>I've come to realize in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal ideas aren't that far from </v>

50
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>libertarian ideas.</v>

51
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>You can make excellent arguments for </v>
<v Speaker 1>racial equality,</v>

52
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>gender equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and marriage equality,</v>

53
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>all from both liberal and Libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>points of view.</v>

54
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>The main difference is how you think the</v>
<v Speaker 1>role of government should be applied.</v>

55
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:07.294
<v Speaker 1>In any of those cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a liberal may want marriage equality </v>

56
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:11.104
<v Speaker 1>because they believed that a gay couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves to be treated the same as a </v>

57
00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>straight couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A libertarian may want marriage equality</v>

58
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>because they don't believe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government has the right to tell any two</v>

59
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>people what kind of contract they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>partake in.</v>

60
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.800
<v Speaker 1>The silent majority of us have much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>in common than we have apart,</v>

61
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a moderate on </v>
<v Speaker 1>either side or just a good old fashioned</v>

62
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:32.284
<v Speaker 1>centrist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to think that most of you who </v>

63
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>watched the Rubin report fall somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that spectrum.</v>

64
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't pretend to have every answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's preposterous to do so.</v>

65
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.533
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not having an answer doesn't stop most </v>

66
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.173
<v Speaker 1>talking heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer to analyze each situation with </v>

67
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>the same level of critical thinking that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apply to the rest of my life.</v>

68
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.613
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many liberals have taken a turn into </v>

69
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>stifling descent with cries of racism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bigotry.</v>

70
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Every time they hear an idea that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like.</v>

71
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>To me being liberal is a constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution of ideas.</v>

72
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:07.114
<v Speaker 1>As time goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This concept doesn't mean changing my </v>

73
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:10.324
<v Speaker 1>ideals or my morals from day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means that I can change as the </v>

74
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>world changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the world in shades of gray rather</v>

75
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>than black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is constantly changing and I'm</v>

76
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>not ashamed to admit that my opinions </v>
<v Speaker 1>have changed along with it.</v>

77
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>That isn't the position of a man without</v>
<v Speaker 1>conviction.</v>

78
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a position of a man with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

79
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.983
<v Speaker 1>As liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must be brave enough to have our </v>

80
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>ideas challenge just like we challenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that came before us.</v>

81
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't about right and wrong.</v>

82
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>It's about having the bravery to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideals.</v>

83
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.173
<v Speaker 1>So to my liberal friends who have chosen</v>
<v Speaker 1>censorship over ideas and smearing over </v>

84
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I challenge you to be brave.</v>

85
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.333
<v Speaker 1>If our ideas are good and our causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just we shouldn't be afraid to defend </v>

86
00:04:58.181 --> 00:04:59.014
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

87
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.423
<v Speaker 1>John Fugal saying is a comedian host of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me everything on Sirius xm insight </v>

88
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.320
<v Speaker 1>and a good buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

89
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:09.630
<v Speaker 1>it took a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've got you on the show.</v>

90
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>

91
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:12.474
<v Speaker 1>It's a pleasure to be back on your show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really should have recorded what </v>

92
00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 1>happened for these last six or eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes because we had.</v>

93
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty good for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewers.</v>

94
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.040
<v Speaker 1>You didn't record what just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a little miscommunication whether</v>

95
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:25.710
<v Speaker 1>we were doing this at 11:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM or pm.</v>

96
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:26.544
<v Speaker 1>Long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just followed you as you ran across </v>

97
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.540
<v Speaker 1>the Sirius xm hallway with your laptop </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming like a crazy person.</v>

98
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.441
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

99
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:38.220
<v Speaker 1>the good news is my evening is now free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were taping.</v>

100
00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:40.560
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were taping at 5:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM your time.</v>

101
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 8:30</v>

102
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.580
<v Speaker 1>PM your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I apologize for the,</v>

103
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:45.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the uh,</v>

104
00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.360
<v Speaker 1>a grasp of the details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

106
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:49.194
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my defense is that I went to public </v>

107
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:50.994
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

108
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing you on to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism,</v>

109
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:59.361
<v Speaker 1>to defend the left and we've already had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a time problem which has set us up here.</v>

110
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>But first let.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we get into anything.</v>

111
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>So you are at Sirius Xm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where your show is.</v>

112
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>You actually tape your show out of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>old studio,</v>

113
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.653
<v Speaker 1>is that correct?</v>

114
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

115
00:06:10.861 --> 00:06:14.280
<v Speaker 2>When I first met you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a very different studio and I was</v>

116
00:06:14.281 --> 00:06:15.114
<v Speaker 2>doing it from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just moved us to another one and </v>

117
00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.080
<v Speaker 2>they're remodeling or here so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

118
00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:19.914
<v Speaker 2>I have done a pre taped interviews in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your old studio and I always think of </v>

119
00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 2>you and I always scour the room for </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcotics you might've lived.</v>

120
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you dedicate each show to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

121
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.760
<v Speaker 2>In my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

122
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Days in my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

123
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

124
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.010
<v Speaker 1>well let's get to it here because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are one of my favorite comics.</v>

125
00:06:36.011 --> 00:06:40.420
<v Speaker 1>You're actually one of the only guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can drag me to do standup.</v>

126
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much the only time I do stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>these days is when you say,</v>

127
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:44.434
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in town and I'm doing one of my </v>

128
00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:45.934
<v Speaker 1>shows and you do these great comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation shows that are mostly about </v>

129
00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:51.250
<v Speaker 1>politics and free speech and religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

130
00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:52.870
<v Speaker 1>all the things that I like talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

131
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so before we get into comedy,</v>

132
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:56.134
<v Speaker 1>let's just talk about your history </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have an incredible </v>

133
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.430
<v Speaker 1>upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your parents background.</v>

134
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Go fugal sang one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

135
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.883
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

136
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.833
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>

137
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 2>We're where to begin at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

138
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an actor.</v>

139
00:07:08.521 --> 00:07:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm a stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a broadcaster.</v>

140
00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

141
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

142
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I come from a curiously Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

143
00:07:14.671 --> 00:07:17.790
<v Speaker 2>My parents are both a former Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>clergy members.</v>

144
00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:18.624
<v Speaker 2>My father being a Franciscan brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother being a nun who spent many </v>

145
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.260
<v Speaker 2>years as a nurse working with lepers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the jungles of Malawi,</v>

146
00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

147
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.163
<v Speaker 2>with a background like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could never afford the therapy I </v>

148
00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:30.924
<v Speaker 2>actually needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got into theater and stand up and </v>

149
00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:35.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the course of my career I've,</v>

150
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I've hosted adult literacy shows for </v>
<v Speaker 2>pbs.</v>

151
00:07:38.581 --> 00:07:41.700
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been murdered on CSI.</v>

152
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten drama league nominations for</v>

153
00:07:44.521 --> 00:07:48.330
<v Speaker 2>off Broadway Solo shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked on MSNBC,</v>

154
00:07:48.331 --> 00:07:49.164
<v Speaker 2>Fox News and CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hosted my own program for the late </v>

155
00:07:52.201 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 2>limited current channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I once got mid,</v>

156
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 2>run these advisor to call ms and etch a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sketch,</v>

157
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.650
<v Speaker 2>got George Harrison to play his final,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

158
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.543
<v Speaker 2>on camera performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I hosted America's funniest home </v>

159
00:08:01.621 --> 00:08:03.120
<v Speaker 2>videos with daisy puentes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

160
00:08:03.121 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty schizophrenia resume.</v>

161
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.353
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not many people can say they replaced </v>

162
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Bob Saget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you did.</v>

163
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could never replace Bob Saget.</v>

164
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Even his wife agreed with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

165
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was happy to,</v>

166
00:08:14.801 --> 00:08:15.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

167
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.113
<v Speaker 2>to take over for the show for a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was only going to be for like six </v>

168
00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:19.600
<v Speaker 2>weeks and it wound up being a year and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half,</v>

169
00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:22.840
<v Speaker 2>so it was a fun little Gig and it taught</v>
<v Speaker 2>me that,</v>

170
00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:25.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't what I needed to do.</v>

171
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:26.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like doing a little bit of the </v>

172
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:29.440
<v Speaker 1>pedigree stuff because it's important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

173
00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:30.274
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's so many talking </v>

174
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:32.740
<v Speaker 1>heads and nobody knows what their </v>
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds are,</v>

175
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:34.630
<v Speaker 1>what they studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they came from,</v>

176
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nice knowing that.</v>

177
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:39.610
<v Speaker 1>So this religious upbringing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

178
00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:43.060
<v Speaker 1>when did you sort of realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said you couldn't afford therapy,</v>

179
00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:43.894
<v Speaker 1>so you went into acting and comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you realize that maybe some of </v>

180
00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:49.540
<v Speaker 1>the constructs of religion word for you?</v>

181
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 2>That's a great question because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>

182
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that we don't talk about too much is</v>

183
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:00.790
<v Speaker 2>the separation of church and faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

184
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.763
<v Speaker 2>the fact that religion and belief are </v>
<v Speaker 2>two completely different things and a </v>

185
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:06.354
<v Speaker 2>religion is a culture of middleman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas faith is just a between the </v>

186
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 2>believer and the day the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their choice.</v>

187
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

188
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always had problems with religion even</v>

189
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:17.660
<v Speaker 2>when I was about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

190
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't until I went to college and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nyu at the Nyu Catholic Center and uh,</v>

191
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:27.190
<v Speaker 2>it was very progressive community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually asked to help teach a,</v>

192
00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:28.024
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a course for Congress along with the </v>

193
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 2>pastor and it was a church that welcomed</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people openly.</v>

194
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.350
<v Speaker 2>And I remember bringing my parents to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

195
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.223
<v Speaker 2>to the church I went to in college and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were so inspired by seeing how gay </v>

196
00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 2>couples were welcomed and loved.</v>

197
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.220
<v Speaker 2>This isn't the ABS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

198
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Kinda made me realize,</v>

199
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:46.974
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the usual policy for this </v>

200
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:52.940
<v Speaker 2>unauthorized fan club with Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

201
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.963
<v Speaker 2>the more I was really when I saw my dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave a lecture at a college once about </v>

202
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Martin Luther and the reformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was like,</v>

203
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.370
<v Speaker 2>why are we Catholic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't we Lutheran?</v>

204
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 2>These rolled in critiques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the pope,</v>

205
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 2>and so that was what really made me be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

206
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.273
<v Speaker 2>not a Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still consider the Catholic church to </v>

207
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 2>be my asexual sexual orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

208
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years,</v>

209
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:14.454
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found the farther I got away from </v>

210
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:16.134
<v Speaker 2>organized religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more interested in theology and </v>

211
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:20.880
<v Speaker 2>faith I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

212
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:21.714
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I get to La and a everybody because </v>

213
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.600
<v Speaker 2>the snf of them think I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

214
00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:27.434
<v Speaker 2>I'm a cult member.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're making a really interesting </v>

215
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:29.520
<v Speaker 2>distinction there.</v>

216
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 2>So you're not into organized religion as</v>
<v Speaker 2>it stands,</v>

217
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.040
<v Speaker 2>but you are a believer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

218
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a believer.</v>

219
00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

220
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think God's an invisible man</v>

221
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:40.944
<v Speaker 2>with a beard and a penis in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no lightening bolts when </v>

222
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:45.960
<v Speaker 2>he's in a moody situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You read the Old Testament.</v>

223
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like the alcoholic step God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

224
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 2>and it's like this big gut cosmic game </v>
<v Speaker 2>of candid camera and God's Allen funt.</v>

225
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

226
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:56.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make a distinction.</v>

227
00:10:56.581 --> 00:11:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I was asked to go and come out bell show</v>
<v Speaker 2>and debate Jamie Kilstein about,</v>

228
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:01.104
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

229
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 2>atheism versus belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

230
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:03.894
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never tell an atheist they are </v>

231
00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:06.084
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My definition of faith doesn't involve </v>

232
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:11.330
<v Speaker 2>telling other people that they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

233
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.330
<v Speaker 2>when I got into the studio they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>me to,</v>

234
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.820
<v Speaker 2>to defend religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

235
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:15.271
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

236
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:15.770
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

237
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll defend anyone's right to worship.</v>

238
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 2>And as long as you're not bothering </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else's personal property,</v>

239
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:24.060
<v Speaker 2>you're putting somebody down in the name</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Jesus then good for you.</v>

240
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.370
<v Speaker 2>God bless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find the fan club that works for you.</v>

241
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.271
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

242
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:28.104
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to defend religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to descend to faith and </v>

243
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:30.870
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

244
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.531
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

245
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:31.761
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

246
00:11:31.761 --> 00:11:32.480
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

247
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as I said,</v>

248
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:34.824
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Jamie and I just told jokes and </v>

249
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:38.150
<v Speaker 2>it got a million hits on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

250
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.680
<v Speaker 2>because I think people are really tired </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the whole.</v>

251
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.970
<v Speaker 2>My God can beat up your God thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

252
00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:46.230
<v Speaker 2>some of the best Christians I know are </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheists,</v>

253
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.320
<v Speaker 2>some of the most godless and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even atheists can go crazy.</v>

254
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:52.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

255
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.580
<v Speaker 2>there's fundamentalist atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

256
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I love the atheist handbook a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great set of rules for people who</v>

257
00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:01.980
<v Speaker 2>are tired of religions set of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

258
00:12:01.981 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

259
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.233
<v Speaker 2>my faith is such that you believe what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to believe if it makes you a </v>

260
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:07.804
<v Speaker 2>better person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the Dalai Lama says the purpose of </v>

261
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:11.120
<v Speaker 2>religion is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

262
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.920
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of religion is to improve </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

263
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 2>not criticize others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

264
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of where I come from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I do enjoy mocking hypocrites.</v>

265
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's been my thing.</v>

266
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You love mocking hypocrites and that's a</v>

267
00:12:26.031 --> 00:12:27.230
<v Speaker 1>lot about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:12:27.231 --> 00:12:28.064
<v Speaker 1>what you're about and when I see you </v>
<v Speaker 1>going back and forth with people on </v>

269
00:12:30.711 --> 00:12:32.390
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hypocrisy.</v>

270
00:12:32.391 --> 00:12:35.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's the main thing usually that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians call out.</v>

271
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:40.460
<v Speaker 1>So when it comes to faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your faith is just your faith to you.</v>

272
00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:41.294
<v Speaker 1>I sense it's just something private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't if you're not even defining </v>

273
00:12:43.671 --> 00:12:45.380
<v Speaker 1>what your faith is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

274
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:46.663
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

275
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anyone wants to talk to me about it,</v>

276
00:12:48.321 --> 00:12:49.370
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But generally,</v>

277
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

278
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.403
<v Speaker 2>my faith is such that I don't pretend to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know all the answers and they often say </v>

279
00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:56.930
<v Speaker 2>the opposite of faith is doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's rubbish.</v>

280
00:12:56.931 --> 00:12:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I think doubt is an integral part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith.</v>

281
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.470
<v Speaker 2>The opposite of faith is certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I trust anybody who,</v>

282
00:13:03.471 --> 00:13:07.310
<v Speaker 2>who's searching for the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I generally don't trust people who claim</v>

283
00:13:07.311 --> 00:13:08.144
<v Speaker 2>they here.</v>

284
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.153
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting because me and you </v>

285
00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:13.410
<v Speaker 1>were sort of splitting hairs on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say I'm not a believer.</v>

286
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't believe in something without </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

287
00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:18.480
<v Speaker 1>But that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind.</v>

288
00:13:18.481 --> 00:13:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of atheists don't like,</v>

289
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.553
<v Speaker 1>people don't like religious people or </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that they're really just diluted </v>

290
00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:26.790
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>

291
00:13:26.791 --> 00:13:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I would go with sort of what you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

292
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:30.540
<v Speaker 1>which is I don't mind if someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious,</v>

293
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I won't pretend to be more moral</v>

294
00:13:32.821 --> 00:13:33.654
<v Speaker 1>than anyone or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or living somehow a better life than </v>

295
00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:36.414
<v Speaker 1>anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want them pushing it on me </v>

296
00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:40.830
<v Speaker 1>or hitting me or put throw in gaze off </v>
<v Speaker 1>roofs.</v>

297
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them using their personal </v>

298
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.990
<v Speaker 2>faith as an excuse to put somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

299
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.480
<v Speaker 2>and that's something I take very </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

300
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.773
<v Speaker 2>There is no part of the Bible you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever use to justify discrimination </v>

301
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.920
<v Speaker 2>against lgbt people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have this debate not infrequently.</v>

302
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no part of the Bible.</v>

303
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can honestly use to justify any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of discrimination.</v>

304
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.530
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you're starting to use Jesus,</v>

305
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.750
<v Speaker 2>when you're starting to use Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a cloaking device for Douche baggery,</v>

306
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.450
<v Speaker 2>that's what I have to call you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

307
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I've known wonderful conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious people.</v>

308
00:14:17.391 --> 00:14:18.224
<v Speaker 2>I think that very often conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians can be more liberal with </v>

309
00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:23.090
<v Speaker 2>kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then lots of liberals,</v>

310
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.840
<v Speaker 2>you'll find a lot more liberality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>warmth and love,</v>

311
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:27.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at certain,</v>

312
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baptist meetings,</v>

313
00:14:29.601 --> 00:14:31.670
<v Speaker 2>then you'll find it upper east side </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocktail parties.</v>

314
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

315
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.280
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>

316
00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm in love with a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

317
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.203
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my definition of God does not </v>

318
00:14:38.841 --> 00:14:41.000
<v Speaker 2>involve a man with a penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

319
00:14:41.001 --> 00:14:42.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

320
00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

321
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.500
<v Speaker 2>the main character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible,</v>

322
00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Jesus is a guy who spoke in parable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphor.</v>

323
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why it's so hard to read </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible as parable metaphor.</v>

324
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of truth in the Bible.</v>

325
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily a lot of facts.</v>

326
00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

327
00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.813
<v Speaker 1>I feel good about our start here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sort of see this a little bit </v>

328
00:15:00.011 --> 00:15:00.844
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I respect where you're coming from </v>

329
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.310
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of what both of us.</v>

330
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be vague enough to sucker</v>

331
00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:06.124
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

332
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're quite good at it.</v>

333
00:15:08.981 --> 00:15:11.020
<v Speaker 1>And by wearing all black and with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>long hair,</v>

334
00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:12.400
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole thing is very effective.</v>

335
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.483
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a beautiful compound that I </v>

336
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:15.494
<v Speaker 2>want to invite all of your viewers down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll have to turn over some account </v>

337
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:18.854
<v Speaker 2>numbers and were rogues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a really a great safe </v>

338
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'll love what we do there.</v>

339
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we'll put the link in the </v>

340
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.440
<v Speaker 1>description down below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about that.</v>

341
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.311
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

342
00:15:26.311 --> 00:15:27.144
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's shift a little bit to comedy </v>

343
00:15:28.831 --> 00:15:30.960
<v Speaker 1>before we jump right into politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

344
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you really decide,</v>

345
00:15:32.821 --> 00:15:33.654
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got something to say and people </v>

346
00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:40.680
<v Speaker 1>need to hear it because that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy thing for a person to do.</v>

347
00:15:40.681 --> 00:15:43.830
<v Speaker 1>And I say that as someone that has done </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup for a long time.</v>

348
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.113
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if anyone needs to hear </v>

349
00:15:45.811 --> 00:15:46.501
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

350
00:15:46.501 --> 00:15:48.510
<v Speaker 2>I never really felt that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just knew that.</v>

351
00:15:48.511 --> 00:15:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time I saw George Carlin lies,</v>

352
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:57.530
<v Speaker 2>he made me feel less alone and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I knew I wanted to do what he did.</v>

353
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.350
<v Speaker 2>I want it to come out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rail against injustice and,</v>

354
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.030
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nonsense and lies.</v>

355
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

356
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.870
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to just be a propagandist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do it creatively.</v>

357
00:16:06.871 --> 00:16:08.780
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to find ways to be funny and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

358
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:09.623
<v Speaker 2>and make it entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've always tried to adhere to a </v>

359
00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 2>principle of entertaining first and </v>
<v Speaker 2>formative.</v>

360
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconded preachy last,</v>

361
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:16.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is easier on stage than it is on </v>

362
00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:19.570
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

363
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.180
<v Speaker 2>But I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

364
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.343
<v Speaker 2>Carlin was really good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a fan of his before I saw him </v>

365
00:16:24.061 --> 00:16:25.570
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once I saw him lives,</v>

366
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:26.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

367
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.280
<v Speaker 2>I knew that that's what I wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

368
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.203
<v Speaker 2>I so admired how he went after </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians and religious leaders and </v>

369
00:16:34.501 --> 00:16:35.334
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just creeps in general and did it </v>

370
00:16:37.321 --> 00:16:38.730
<v Speaker 2>using humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

371
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.420
<v Speaker 2>rather than hate or a or just propaganda</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

372
00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:44.340
<v Speaker 2>so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love doing stand up.</v>

373
00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.770
<v Speaker 2>It's just silly nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also,</v>

374
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I also really love to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

375
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.920
<v Speaker 2>to work out logic through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

376
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.550
<v Speaker 2>penis jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my morality.</v>

377
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:54.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

378
00:16:54.521 --> 00:16:57.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me the real beauty of Carlin was that</v>

379
00:16:57.521 --> 00:17:01.450
<v Speaker 1>key was the most political you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be.</v>

380
00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:05.920
<v Speaker 1>And yet at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rarely commented on politics of the</v>

381
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.753
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

382
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was alive,</v>

383
00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:08.854
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he would be commenting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much on the race horse that we're </v>

384
00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.500
<v Speaker 1>all caught in of the trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hillary,</v>

385
00:17:14.501 --> 00:17:15.101
<v Speaker 1>Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

386
00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:15.760
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing.</v>

387
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.790
<v Speaker 1>But he would be commenting on the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces of it and then you Kinda,</v>

388
00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:20.380
<v Speaker 1>you kinda take the same approach.</v>

389
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

390
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.083
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he spoke extensively about the Reagan </v>

392
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:25.580
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

393
00:17:25.581 --> 00:17:26.414
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talks a lot about Clinton versus </v>

394
00:17:27.411 --> 00:17:28.244
<v Speaker 2>double.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you listen to the albums from </v>

395
00:17:29.211 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 2>the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what am I doing in New Jersey?</v>

396
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:31.844
<v Speaker 2>And then of course I think I'm a jam in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a jam and in New York is his best album </v>

397
00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:36.554
<v Speaker 2>and back in town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that followed it is almost as </v>

398
00:17:37.971 --> 00:17:38.804
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he would have flipped it up the </v>

399
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:41.354
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even like you are all diseased with </v>

400
00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 2>an album where he talked about Bush and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

401
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:46.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

402
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.980
<v Speaker 2>he talked a lot about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

403
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.820
<v Speaker 2>supporting governor Bush after nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 11,</v>

404
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't like him.</v>

405
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 2>He would only call him governor Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

406
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't make us whole sets about it,</v>

407
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.903
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he more or less took on the introduced </v>

408
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.390
<v Speaker 2>bag in all of us and politicians were </v>
<v Speaker 2>very often the starting point for him to</v>

409
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:04.224
<v Speaker 2>jump off into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into just social hypocrisy that the </v>

410
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 2>politicians are just figureheads of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

411
00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:09.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

412
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.550
<v Speaker 2>he did single out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Clinton,</v>

413
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:12.384
<v Speaker 2>he went off on a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I once saw him in Vegas where he was </v>

414
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 2>railing against the Bush family and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

415
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:18.414
<v Speaker 2>I hope the whole family dies and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>airplane fire and people were walking </v>

416
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:21.924
<v Speaker 2>out in droves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a pleasure to watch him work </v>

417
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.650
<v Speaker 2>out as material that way and separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the anger from the humor,</v>

418
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.733
<v Speaker 2>separate anger from the outrage because </v>
<v Speaker 2>anger doesn't work in comedy but </v>

419
00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 2>outraged us.</v>

420
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.613
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get right to that line and </v>

421
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:37.194
<v Speaker 1>tow it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can tell some people the </v>

422
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:40.320
<v Speaker 1>truth because if you tell them the truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're being funny,</v>

423
00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:41.154
<v Speaker 1>that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you tell them the truth and </v>

424
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the pitchforks come.</v>

425
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

426
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billy Wilder,</v>

427
00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billy Wilder said,</v>

428
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.380
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to tell people the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

429
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.860
<v Speaker 2>make it funny or they'll kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

430
00:18:51.861 --> 00:18:53.250
<v Speaker 2>I keep that quote around.</v>

431
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

432
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.600
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>

433
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.740
<v Speaker 1>let's jump into some political stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are a through and through liberal.</v>

434
00:18:59.741 --> 00:19:00.574
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're one of my left friends that I </v>

435
00:19:03.221 --> 00:19:05.590
<v Speaker 1>still understand a lot of what I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing on the show.</v>

436
00:19:05.591 --> 00:19:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I've lost a lot of my people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

437
00:19:07.991 --> 00:19:11.020
<v Speaker 1>but I consider you a good liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you consider yourself a liberal?</v>

438
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Does that have any meaning to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore?</v>

439
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.533
<v Speaker 1>That the words.</v>

440
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're telling you the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

441
00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:17.054
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago I got called a liberal </v>

442
00:19:18.651 --> 00:19:23.420
<v Speaker 2>because I supported gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I supported a decriminalizing marijuana.</v>

443
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I thought Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his economic plans weren't going to work</v>

444
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.430
<v Speaker 2>and I was against the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

445
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.550
<v Speaker 2>it turns out I wasn't a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was prematurely mainstream.</v>

446
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

447
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.093
<v Speaker 2>And throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think prematurely mainstream is what </v>

448
00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:37.424
<v Speaker 2>liberals have them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been the ones who fight for </v>

449
00:19:38.391 --> 00:19:40.730
<v Speaker 2>social change generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

450
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.803
<v Speaker 2>everyone I know every interesting person</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know is liberal in some areas and </v>

451
00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:46.680
<v Speaker 2>conservative and others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

452
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.750
<v Speaker 2>if you're all just one or the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

453
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.633
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You become a guy at a star trek </v>

454
00:19:50.871 --> 00:19:52.180
<v Speaker 2>convention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

455
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get asked this question and I,</v>

456
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what liberal means </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

457
00:19:56.691 --> 00:19:57.524
<v Speaker 2>but when I read the dictionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of the word I aspire to be </v>

458
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:01.161
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:20:01.161 --> 00:20:01.994
<v Speaker 2>like I was on the show on Fox News and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they kept trying to get me to admit I </v>

460
00:20:04.521 --> 00:20:08.840
<v Speaker 2>was a liberal than I said I aspire to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a liberal the same way I aspired to be a</v>

461
00:20:08.841 --> 00:20:09.674
<v Speaker 2>Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I would ever self </v>

462
00:20:11.271 --> 00:20:13.010
<v Speaker 2>identify as either of those two words.</v>

463
00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I love that.</v>

464
00:20:14.441 --> 00:20:18.070
<v Speaker 1>And you weren't connected to us on skype</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I did the intro to the show,</v>

465
00:20:18.071 --> 00:20:21.280
<v Speaker 1>but I actually took the deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the literal definition,</v>

466
00:20:21.281 --> 00:20:22.114
<v Speaker 1>the dictionary definition of liberal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it out and it's someone who's </v>

467
00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.310
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your ideas are evolving,</v>

468
00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:32.311
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to challenge the </v>
<v Speaker 1>status quo then then you are a liberal.</v>

469
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.423
<v Speaker 1>And it's so funny to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember back in 1992 when I was 12 </v>

470
00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:38.374
<v Speaker 1>years old and we were doing a mock </v>
<v Speaker 1>election when Dukakis was running </v>

471
00:20:41.591 --> 00:20:45.070
<v Speaker 1>against George H,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w Bush and George was that.</v>

472
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was 88,</v>

473
00:20:46.601 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>that was 88.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety two was the,</v>

474
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.860
<v Speaker 1>was a Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

475
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.440
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and George Hw said,</v>

476
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 1>you're a liberal and Dukakis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not a liberal.</v>

477
00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 1>And that was the Democrat because </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal became a dirty word back then.</v>

478
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy for that.</v>

479
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.270
<v Speaker 2>By the end of that campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress finally said,</v>

480
00:21:05.271 --> 00:21:06.104
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a liberal tradition of JFK and all </v>

481
00:21:07.491 --> 00:21:10.040
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Bush celebrated instead of wonder of</v>

482
00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:11.420
<v Speaker 2>wonders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he finally admits it.</v>

483
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.970
<v Speaker 2>And I give Bush credit for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

484
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:14.953
<v Speaker 2>making a word that means a empathetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and open minded and caring about the </v>

485
00:21:18.831 --> 00:21:19.970
<v Speaker 2>least of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

486
00:21:19.971 --> 00:21:23.990
<v Speaker 2>a word that pretty much sums up Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go by the dictionary definition,</v>

487
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

488
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.500
<v Speaker 2>and Bush Sr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the most credit for turning</v>

489
00:21:27.501 --> 00:21:29.270
<v Speaker 2>it into a dirty word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

490
00:21:29.271 --> 00:21:30.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

491
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.513
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you can see that Jesus </v>

492
00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:37.490
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a liberal if you go by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictionary definition of the term and he</v>

493
00:21:37.491 --> 00:21:38.301
<v Speaker 2>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

494
00:21:38.301 --> 00:21:39.720
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't,</v>

495
00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:40.554
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state didn't put them to death and </v>

496
00:21:41.211 --> 00:21:42.044
<v Speaker 2>the conservative religious bosses of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their day didn't put him to death </v>

497
00:21:44.391 --> 00:21:46.340
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't rock the boat up.</v>

498
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.680
<v Speaker 1>He didn't not want change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

499
00:21:49.681 --> 00:21:51.900
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy who wanted some change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

500
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.550
<v Speaker 2>But by that same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:21:53.551 --> 00:21:54.384
<v Speaker 2>that that definition you bring up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the greatest proof that we don't </v>

502
00:21:57.061 --> 00:21:58.670
<v Speaker 2>have a liberal media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

503
00:21:58.671 --> 00:22:01.110
<v Speaker 2>our friends on the right or thunder </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying it's the liberal media.</v>

504
00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:02.100
<v Speaker 2>And I've just been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

505
00:22:02.101 --> 00:22:04.200
<v Speaker 2>this year is proven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the media was liberal,</v>

506
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean for awhile we've known if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were liberal,</v>

507
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:11.580
<v Speaker 2>they'd probably cover an anti war rally </v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as they cover a tea party event.</v>

508
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the media was liberal,</v>

509
00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I think they would have given Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanders a bit more than one 80th.</v>

510
00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.270
<v Speaker 2>The air time they've given Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media profit driven.</v>

511
00:22:21.271 --> 00:22:22.950
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of liberals who work in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media,</v>

512
00:22:22.951 --> 00:22:26.010
<v Speaker 2>but the media itself is ratings driven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's profit driven.</v>

513
00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:28.260
<v Speaker 2>That's not necessarily a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how it is.</v>

514
00:22:28.261 --> 00:22:30.420
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of liberals and conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>can admit that.</v>

515
00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.363
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I love that you made that point </v>

516
00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:33.584
<v Speaker 1>because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's profit driven and people want </v>

517
00:22:35.931 --> 00:22:38.210
<v Speaker 1>clicks and people want views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all understand that.</v>

518
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what a better model would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

519
00:22:40.671 --> 00:22:41.504
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that the government coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and saying everyone should have </v>

520
00:22:43.311 --> 00:22:44.144
<v Speaker 1>exactly equal time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that that really makes </v>

521
00:22:46.041 --> 00:22:47.420
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a huge government guy,</v>

522
00:22:47.421 --> 00:22:50.240
<v Speaker 1>so I don't really love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of the day,</v>

523
00:22:50.241 --> 00:22:53.690
<v Speaker 1>if more people are watching trump and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just using the system,</v>

524
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.840
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of where we're at.</v>

525
00:22:56.841 --> 00:22:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Like what else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else can we do?</v>

526
00:22:59.010 --> 00:22:59.843
<v Speaker 2>Like the restorative fairness doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could have more than one pbs and we </v>

527
00:23:02.221 --> 00:23:04.920
<v Speaker 2>can have a pvs for liberals and a pbs </v>
<v Speaker 2>for conservatives.</v>

528
00:23:04.921 --> 00:23:09.300
<v Speaker 2>I think we could have presidential </v>
<v Speaker 2>debates every week on pbs where it's not</v>

529
00:23:09.301 --> 00:23:10.470
<v Speaker 2>about profit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

530
00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:11.830
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

531
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.790
<v Speaker 2>a corporate media from having to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible to their shareholders.</v>

532
00:23:14.791 --> 00:23:17.610
<v Speaker 2>That's just how the culture in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry has evolved.</v>

533
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Once you can admit that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

534
00:23:19.801 --> 00:23:20.634
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump seems to think that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ratings and all this airtime mean </v>

535
00:23:23.071 --> 00:23:23.904
<v Speaker 2>people love him with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of folks in the media </v>

536
00:23:26.461 --> 00:23:27.294
<v Speaker 2>haven't realized is a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratings that trump generates is because </v>

537
00:23:30.481 --> 00:23:33.300
<v Speaker 2>a large number of people are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate watching him.</v>

538
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.573
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is the true detective season two of </v>

539
00:23:36.151 --> 00:23:41.151
<v Speaker 2>politics and watching to see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible he is.</v>

540
00:23:41.941 --> 00:23:44.460
<v Speaker 2>The way you slow down for a car wreck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

541
00:23:44.461 --> 00:23:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't think necessarily translates </v>
<v Speaker 2>into loves.</v>

542
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I stopped watching true detective season</v>
<v Speaker 1>two after one episode.</v>

543
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country hasn't quite caught up to me</v>

544
00:23:53.311 --> 00:23:53.870
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>

545
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I stayed to the bitter end like Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vice and let me tell,</v>

546
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never get those 10 hours back.</v>

547
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

548
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that,</v>

549
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.693
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

550
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC is doing great in their ratings </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

551
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.383
<v Speaker 2>But I think it maybe because people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fascinated at this trump thing is </v>

552
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:12.770
<v Speaker 2>actually happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

553
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:16.160
<v Speaker 2>as a novelty act historically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never happened before.</v>

554
00:24:16.161 --> 00:24:18.960
<v Speaker 2>It'll probably never happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

555
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.560
<v Speaker 2>so in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's newsworthy in much the same</v>

556
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:22.394
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Malaysian plane going </v>

557
00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:24.104
<v Speaker 2>missing or the Oj case was newsworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are things that have never </v>

558
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:27.854
<v Speaker 2>happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really be grudge the population for </v>

559
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:30.914
<v Speaker 2>leaning in to watch a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spectacle that our grandparents </v>

560
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:34.214
<v Speaker 2>couldn't have imagined.</v>

561
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So isn't it a little bit of both with </v>

562
00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:37.374
<v Speaker 1>trump though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's obviously the spectacle </v>

563
00:24:38.881 --> 00:24:41.010
<v Speaker 1>and the sort of carnival atmosphere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>

564
00:24:41.011 --> 00:24:41.844
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time I read the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day that I think at this point he has </v>

565
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.110
<v Speaker 1>more votes than any other Republican in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the primaries,</v>

566
00:24:49.111 --> 00:24:49.944
<v Speaker 1>or at least he's going to certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>break a Romney's record or george w </v>

567
00:24:53.401 --> 00:24:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Bush's record by the time California </v>
<v Speaker 1>runs around.</v>

568
00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more than Reagan already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

569
00:24:57.991 --> 00:25:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Part of that is just demographics change</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that kinda stuff.</v>

570
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.740
<v Speaker 1>But the point is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

571
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.290
<v Speaker 1>People are actually voting for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just you thing</v>

572
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.030
<v Speaker 2>one percent now a approval of the gop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means Dave,</v>

573
00:25:09.031 --> 00:25:14.031
<v Speaker 2>that Donald trump is so popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got 50 percent of 28 percent of the</v>

574
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.033
<v Speaker 2>American Legion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

575
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Hillary and Bernie combined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

576
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:19.780
<v Speaker 2>have gotten more votes.</v>

577
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were,</v>

578
00:25:20.981 --> 00:25:21.814
<v Speaker 1>if you were conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were a republican right now and </v>

579
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you were in a trump guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you do?</v>

580
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:26.883
<v Speaker 1>Because I find that they're in a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>bind right now because if you're a </v>

581
00:25:29.741 --> 00:25:30.574
<v Speaker 1>mainstream establishment Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can go into that </v>

582
00:25:34.511 --> 00:25:35.344
<v Speaker 1>convention and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to steal this thing away </v>

583
00:25:36.371 --> 00:25:37.480
<v Speaker 1>because we don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would,</v>

584
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.333
<v Speaker 1>it would expose such a horrible flaw in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system and really be undemocratic </v>

585
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time they're giving up </v>
<v Speaker 1>their party,</v>

586
00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.040
<v Speaker 2>but I think they've already been exposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

587
00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:47.874
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe the Republican Party is </v>

588
00:25:48.841 --> 00:25:53.670
<v Speaker 2>against the government at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Government is how in my lifetime they've</v>

589
00:25:53.671 --> 00:25:55.740
<v Speaker 2>redistributed wealth to the top two </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

590
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.530
<v Speaker 2>They don't dislike government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They disliked democracy.</v>

591
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.620
<v Speaker 2>And we've seen it time and time again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at these,</v>

592
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.290
<v Speaker 2>look at these ridiculous voter Id laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

593
00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:06.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as the supreme court removed the</v>

594
00:26:06.571 --> 00:26:07.404
<v Speaker 2>preclearance regulations in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these voter ID laws go up all over the </v>

595
00:26:10.951 --> 00:26:13.620
<v Speaker 2>place because they want as low a turnout</v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>

596
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.580
<v Speaker 2>We know they don't care about the will </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people based on a Bush v Gore.</v>

597
00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.400
<v Speaker 2>We know that they don't care about </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>

598
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government,</v>

599
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.510
<v Speaker 2>they're not really against that.</v>

600
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where you before,</v>

601
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.510
<v Speaker 1>just like a basic voter id registration </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

602
00:26:28.511 --> 00:26:31.990
<v Speaker 1>just that you just have to have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of identification,</v>

603
00:26:31.991 --> 00:26:35.320
<v Speaker 1>some government issued identification </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I get you on that,</v>

604
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.423
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you should just be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to walk in with nothing and just </v>

605
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.030
<v Speaker 1>sign.</v>

606
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.780
<v Speaker 2>If you've registered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your name is on a,</v>

607
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.570
<v Speaker 2>is on a registry when you go into vote.</v>

608
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But shouldn't you have to prove that you</v>

609
00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.010
<v Speaker 2>are that person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

610
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.140
<v Speaker 2>And votes in your place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

611
00:26:47.141 --> 00:26:49.270
<v Speaker 2>the fact is you're going to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a right,</v>

612
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.370
<v Speaker 2>unless you get a photo id and many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these photo ids,</v>

613
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.710
<v Speaker 2>you have to pay fees to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in reality,</v>

614
00:26:56.711 --> 00:26:59.170
<v Speaker 2>that's a poll tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you know,</v>

615
00:26:59.171 --> 00:27:02.800
<v Speaker 2>a lot of folks say that gutting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>voting rights act in 2013,</v>

616
00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.960
<v Speaker 2>which was done by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same week,</v>

617
00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.213
<v Speaker 2>they greenlit Sharknado too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that was just the end of our </v>

618
00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:10.960
<v Speaker 2>country and my total coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

619
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.450
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't just keep African Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>from voting,</v>

620
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.313
<v Speaker 2>it was designed to keep seniors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low income people of all races and </v>

621
00:27:19.001 --> 00:27:19.834
<v Speaker 2>college kids from voting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's districts in this country where </v>

622
00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:25.870
<v Speaker 2>you can vote with an NRA id but not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>university id.</v>

623
00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.930
<v Speaker 2>And the right wing response to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

624
00:27:28.931 --> 00:27:31.900
<v Speaker 2>but foreigners can get college ids will </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess skeeter,</v>

625
00:27:31.901 --> 00:27:33.490
<v Speaker 2>but foreigners can't have registered to </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>

626
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.593
<v Speaker 2>So that's not a problem where people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed by televisions every year that </v>

627
00:27:37.691 --> 00:27:38.524
<v Speaker 2>are than vote illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The New York Times did an extensive </v>

628
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.313
<v Speaker 2>study and found that out over a billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>votes cast far less than one percent </v>

629
00:27:45.101 --> 00:27:47.680
<v Speaker 2>were fraudulent cast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's voter registration fraud.</v>

630
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.960
<v Speaker 2>There's no voter fraud is designed </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliberately to make people vote less.</v>

631
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:53.873
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say there's gotta be some way </v>

632
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:55.734
<v Speaker 1>that it can be subsidized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just give everyone some card that </v>

633
00:27:58.081 --> 00:27:58.914
<v Speaker 1>proves who they are even even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the numbers are incredibly low </v>

634
00:28:01.381 --> 00:28:02.214
<v Speaker 1>and then you register and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>some card that has your picture on it </v>

635
00:28:03.991 --> 00:28:05.760
<v Speaker 1>and the government paid for it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

636
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Your a voter registration card every </v>
<v Speaker 2>year to your home address.</v>

637
00:28:08.531 --> 00:28:11.890
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it's like this,</v>

638
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing with the voter id laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>is just more proof of how a undemocratic</v>

639
00:28:17.201 --> 00:28:18.034
<v Speaker 2>the entire process is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really think that what we should </v>

640
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.243
<v Speaker 2>be talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to make it easier to vote not </v>

641
00:28:23.861 --> 00:28:24.860
<v Speaker 2>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

642
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Why do we only vote the first Tuesday in</v>
<v Speaker 2>November?</v>

643
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.313
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because we're still living by 18th </v>

644
00:28:30.161 --> 00:28:32.140
<v Speaker 2>century standards in an agrarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>

645
00:28:32.141 --> 00:28:35.940
<v Speaker 2>We were mostly farmers and you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>planting your crops up until,</v>

646
00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.350
<v Speaker 2>you know you are harvesting up until the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of October.</v>

647
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.393
<v Speaker 2>And then the presumption was the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunday in November you'd go to church </v>

648
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.560
<v Speaker 2>and then Monday it would take you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful day traveling by horse or mule</v>

649
00:28:47.561 --> 00:28:50.650
<v Speaker 2>to get to the nearest polling station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you could vote on Tuesday.</v>

650
00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.693
<v Speaker 2>So we're being controlled by the living </v>
<v Speaker 2>habits of people who've been dead for </v>

651
00:28:54.371 --> 00:28:55.204
<v Speaker 2>over 100 years instead of having it be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like motor voter where you get your </v>

652
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.430
<v Speaker 2>registration as soon as you get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>license.</v>

653
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't we have a holiday to vote?</v>

654
00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.500
<v Speaker 1>That to me is the number one one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the day off.</v>

655
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

656
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.970
<v Speaker 2>we're able to vote online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

657
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.120
<v Speaker 2>we should make it a lot easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be trying everything we can do</v>

658
00:29:12.121 --> 00:29:12.954
<v Speaker 2>to drive up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to a enrollments to drive a voter </v>

659
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:18.600
<v Speaker 2>participation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How people manage their own democracy.</v>

660
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but since the beginning of this country,</v>

661
00:29:20.731 --> 00:29:21.564
<v Speaker 2>when the founding fathers thought only </v>
<v Speaker 2>land owning white men should be allowed </v>

662
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:26.460
<v Speaker 2>to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've always talked the talk.</v>

663
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.790
<v Speaker 2>We haven't walked the walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm a big fan of democracy.</v>

664
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

665
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Democracy is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>

666
00:29:33.741 --> 00:29:35.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will agree with you on that one.</v>

667
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.513
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about the Democrats a </v>

668
00:29:37.341 --> 00:29:38.990
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect,</v>

669
00:29:38.991 --> 00:29:40.940
<v Speaker 1>but I can't totally confirm your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a Bernie,</v>

670
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:41.973
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

671
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Bernie guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

672
00:29:43.761 --> 00:29:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just if you go by policies alone,</v>

673
00:29:45.861 --> 00:29:46.850
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

674
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.370
<v Speaker 2>no candidates ever gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

675
00:29:49.371 --> 00:29:53.300
<v Speaker 2>we have these purity tests for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians and no politician,</v>

676
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.150
<v Speaker 2>no a lover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no relative,</v>

677
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.900
<v Speaker 2>no artist is ever gonna match your </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire checklist.</v>

678
00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:01.483
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every rockstar you've ever admired has </v>

679
00:30:02.871 --> 00:30:05.060
<v Speaker 2>released a bad album or done something </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing.</v>

680
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every great filmmaker hasn't,</v>

681
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:07.203
<v Speaker 2>beloved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No politician is going to match your </v>

682
00:30:08.841 --> 00:30:11.900
<v Speaker 2>purity tests at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see the Democratic Party,</v>

683
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.970
<v Speaker 2>which I'm not a member of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm independent.</v>

684
00:30:13.971 --> 00:30:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I always have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a democrat.</v>

685
00:30:16.161 --> 00:30:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Republicans generally forced me to vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>

686
00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.540
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

687
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see the civil war where it's like,</v>

688
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:22.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom's friends fighting with GRANDPA's </v>

689
00:30:24.381 --> 00:30:25.610
<v Speaker 2>friend said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so ugly.</v>

690
00:30:25.611 --> 00:30:26.444
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to watch Margaret that </v>
<v Speaker 2>should or beat up fiveish finkel in a </v>

691
00:30:28.431 --> 00:30:29.264
<v Speaker 2>cage match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just civil war of the left is the most </v>

692
00:30:31.431 --> 00:30:32.780
<v Speaker 2>depressing thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

693
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.510
<v Speaker 2>generally depressing election year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

694
00:30:35.511 --> 00:30:36.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

695
00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:37.334
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of issues with Hillary </v>

696
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:39.283
<v Speaker 2>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

697
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.173
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think that I'm ready to </v>

698
00:30:42.831 --> 00:30:45.560
<v Speaker 2>hand the nuclear launch codes over to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump just yet.</v>

699
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:46.503
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's unpack that a little bit </v>

700
00:30:47.701 --> 00:30:48.534
<v Speaker 1>because I'm fully on board that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of my problems with the left </v>

701
00:30:51.121 --> 00:30:51.954
<v Speaker 1>right now is they have gone out of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to demonize hillary to a point that </v>

702
00:30:56.611 --> 00:30:58.800
<v Speaker 1>they're making it sound like she is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil Kahn.</v>

703
00:30:58.801 --> 00:31:02.490
<v Speaker 1>That she wants to build nations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight all these extra words.</v>

704
00:31:02.491 --> 00:31:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Now I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did vote for her act.</v>

705
00:31:04.191 --> 00:31:07.340
<v Speaker 1>She did vote for the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was secretary of state when,</v>

706
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.193
<v Speaker 1>when Ben Gazi happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Barack Obama was president Barack </v>

707
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Obama's president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now we're,</v>

708
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.970
<v Speaker 1>we have some troops now in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have Afghanistan.</v>

709
00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constant.</v>

710
00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.420
<v Speaker 2>The most disgusting thing they've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

711
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.640
<v Speaker 2>exploiting the murder of these four </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

712
00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that it was terrorists </v>
<v Speaker 2>who did it,</v>

713
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.263
<v Speaker 2>but we've seen this whole process of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we take these corpses and use them </v>

714
00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:27.740
<v Speaker 2>against politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>

715
00:31:27.741 --> 00:31:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Like first it was Susan Rice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it was Barack Obama,</v>

716
00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:31.813
<v Speaker 2>now it's all Hillary Clinton's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These folks have never blamed a </v>

717
00:31:33.631 --> 00:31:34.464
<v Speaker 2>terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never held the CIA or portray </v>

718
00:31:35.811 --> 00:31:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Patraeus responsible for what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

719
00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.160
<v Speaker 2>And we're never going to know because </v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely,</v>

720
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.023
<v Speaker 2>I mean Petraeus is mit resending to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech that there was a black site </v>

721
00:31:43.491 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 2>prison in the basement of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

722
00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.550
<v Speaker 2>So we're never going to know the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

723
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:47.691
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:31:47.691 --> 00:31:48.524
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find half my day is spent defending </v>

725
00:31:50.091 --> 00:31:50.924
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton against unfair attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think blaming a woman for her </v>

726
00:31:53.991 --> 00:31:54.824
<v Speaker 2>husband's infidelity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck getting female voters with </v>

727
00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:58.190
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

728
00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.400
<v Speaker 2>I hear people bringing up Bill Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 2>raped 20 to broderick again.</v>

729
00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.293
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has nothing to do with policy and </v>

730
00:32:03.531 --> 00:32:04.364
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton is not running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Donald Trump has been accused of </v>

731
00:32:07.221 --> 00:32:09.140
<v Speaker 2>rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronald Reagan was accused of rape.</v>

732
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton was accused of rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to do?</v>

733
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.253
<v Speaker 1>So this goes to that purity thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned because it seems to me </v>

734
00:32:15.451 --> 00:32:18.270
<v Speaker 1>that the far left has taken Bernie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they've basically said,</v>

735
00:32:18.271 --> 00:32:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Bernie's are Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love all of these ideas.</v>

736
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.433
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love them so much that we have to </v>

737
00:32:25.021 --> 00:32:28.020
<v Speaker 1>destroy Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I see the problem there is,</v>

738
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:32.490
<v Speaker 1>is that ultimately you could end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>ushering in president trump.</v>

739
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the left will be,</v>

740
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:35.543
<v Speaker 1>they've demonized her to the point that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these young people are just not </v>

741
00:32:38.071 --> 00:32:39.120
<v Speaker 1>going to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

742
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm voting</v>

743
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 2>for new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

744
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:42.104
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

745
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't blame Ralph Nader for George </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush becoming president of.</v>

746
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was great that Nader ran </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think he had a right to run that.</v>

747
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:51.090
<v Speaker 2>I think that he had the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

748
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.330
<v Speaker 2>policy position of any candidate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

749
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:54.403
<v Speaker 2>I do blame 90,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>idiots in Florida who knew they were in </v>

750
00:32:58.431 --> 00:33:00.830
<v Speaker 2>a battle ground state and voted for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nader.</v>

751
00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

752
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:05.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm voting for nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Bernie a lot on paper,</v>

753
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.253
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magic number of this campaign date </v>

754
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:08.504
<v Speaker 2>is 147.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Ruth Bader Ginsburg's age this </v>

755
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.383
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're voting for the supreme court </v>

756
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.170
<v Speaker 2>possibly voting for three judges on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Supreme Court.</v>

757
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.213
<v Speaker 2>Would you rather have Hillary Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 2>appoint someone who respects women's </v>

758
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:23.144
<v Speaker 2>reproductive freedoms or would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather have Donald Trump but Amarosa or </v>

759
00:33:26.361 --> 00:33:27.194
<v Speaker 2>Gary Busey on the court?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're looking at right </v>

760
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:29.960
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

761
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:31.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

762
00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:32.324
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's probably gonna wind up happening </v>

763
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.380
<v Speaker 2>is Hillary Clinton will get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's votes.</v>

764
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 2>She won't get their enthusiasm.</v>

765
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems pretty obvious.</v>

766
00:33:39.711 --> 00:33:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the way you're describing,</v>

767
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 1>not that you're saying you're supporting</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

768
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.200
<v Speaker 1>but even the way you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

769
00:33:44.201 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a tepid defense,</v>

770
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:47.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

771
00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.490
<v Speaker 2>You keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought my shows.</v>

772
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Tepid is the new black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:33:52.391 --> 00:33:53.260
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

774
00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.600
<v Speaker 2>it's like I think that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks who,</v>

775
00:33:55.601 --> 00:33:56.434
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like hillary personally or don't </v>

776
00:33:58.121 --> 00:34:00.520
<v Speaker 2>like her policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I get all of that.</v>

777
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I will say that if she means half of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you said on this election trail,</v>

778
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 2016,</v>

779
00:34:06.341 --> 00:34:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Hillary is a much better candidate than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 2008.</v>

780
00:34:09.401 --> 00:34:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been very,</v>

781
00:34:10.331 --> 00:34:11.164
<v Speaker 2>very impressed with the positions and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>give 'em Bernie Sanders a ton of credit </v>

782
00:34:14.831 --> 00:34:15.664
<v Speaker 2>for forcing her to take these moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions that would actually help the </v>

783
00:34:18.551 --> 00:34:19.384
<v Speaker 2>middle class and help our economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Elizabeth Warren gets a lot of </v>

784
00:34:21.671 --> 00:34:22.720
<v Speaker 2>credit to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's clear.</v>

785
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.823
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secretary Clinton has read Senator </v>

786
00:34:24.581 --> 00:34:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Warren's book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

787
00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:29.110
<v Speaker 2>but I have a lot of issues with Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let me tell you,</v>

788
00:34:29.111 --> 00:34:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I posted a couple of jokes defending her</v>

789
00:34:31.421 --> 00:34:32.254
<v Speaker 2>against these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sexist attacks against her because of </v>

790
00:34:35.051 --> 00:34:39.010
<v Speaker 2>her husband's and fidelity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is that one of the easiest</v>

791
00:34:39.011 --> 00:34:41.200
<v Speaker 2>things you can do and the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive.</v>

792
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.740
<v Speaker 2>So we came after me over it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispiriting because,</v>

793
00:34:44.741 --> 00:34:45.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

794
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't consider Monica Lewinsky to be a</v>

795
00:34:49.481 --> 00:34:50.314
<v Speaker 2>victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what Bill Clinton did was wrong </v>

796
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.630
<v Speaker 2>and unprofessional and I think he's paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deep price for it.</v>

797
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.733
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't consider Monica Lewinsky to </v>

798
00:34:58.511 --> 00:35:01.840
<v Speaker 2>be a victim and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by having that point of view,</v>

799
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:02.703
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't consensual </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between two adults by her </v>

800
00:35:05.141 --> 00:35:06.670
<v Speaker 2>own testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she pursued it.</v>

801
00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.620
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

802
00:35:08.621 --> 00:35:11.770
<v Speaker 2>and I happen to think that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of that is our business anyway,</v>

803
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:12.873
<v Speaker 2>but when you start trying to use a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman's husband's infidelities against </v>

804
00:35:15.791 --> 00:35:16.624
<v Speaker 2>her to say that she is unfit to serve </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she kept her marriage together </v>

805
00:35:19.391 --> 00:35:21.490
<v Speaker 2>and didn't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what their marriages.</v>

806
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:22.383
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what their arrangement is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't judge anybody in this life </v>

807
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.833
<v Speaker 2>for what system of love works for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they both have their own people on </v>

808
00:35:28.811 --> 00:35:30.160
<v Speaker 2>the side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're staying together.</v>

809
00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to make a relationship work</v>

810
00:35:32.471 --> 00:35:34.630
<v Speaker 2>in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hard to make love work in this world.</v>

811
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton has been married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe a one slash third.</v>

812
00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.493
<v Speaker 2>The Times Donald trump has been married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get to judge someone's </v>

813
00:35:41.341 --> 00:35:43.180
<v Speaker 2>relationship or how they loved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

814
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.730
<v Speaker 2>It's all a sham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marriage is fine.</v>

815
00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:45.564
<v Speaker 2>It works for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever I'm going to go based on the </v>

816
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 2>issues and not based on someone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal life,</v>

817
00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:50.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fugal saying,</v>

818
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:51.703
<v Speaker 1>I gotta tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is so refreshing to talk to someone </v>

819
00:35:53.411 --> 00:35:57.520
<v Speaker 1>on the left with a little nuance because</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I've been talking about for</v>

820
00:35:57.521 --> 00:36:00.550
<v Speaker 1>months that it seems to me the left has </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost their mind.</v>

821
00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.413
<v Speaker 1>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time that you disagree with sort </v>

822
00:36:04.451 --> 00:36:05.284
<v Speaker 1>of the mainstream progressives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a racist or you are a beginner </v>

823
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.430
<v Speaker 1>or you are a homophobe and they've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

824
00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.293
<v Speaker 1>decent people that are basically liberal</v>
<v Speaker 1>or basically centrist or even a little </v>

825
00:36:17.021 --> 00:36:17.854
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've made them all look crazy and </v>

826
00:36:20.021 --> 00:36:20.854
<v Speaker 1>that is fueling trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the exact conversation I've </v>

827
00:36:23.231 --> 00:36:26.710
<v Speaker 1>wanted to have with someone that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider a simpatico on this stuff.</v>

828
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.713
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why I've never joined</v>
<v Speaker 2>a political party because people just </v>

829
00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:32.160
<v Speaker 2>lose their damn minds over this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I look at facebook,</v>

830
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:32.994
<v Speaker 2>which has just become like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's become like electronic Bosnia and </v>

831
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.423
<v Speaker 2>everyone's at war with everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of feel like y'all are going to </v>

832
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:41.754
<v Speaker 2>have to get along and share this earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other after November of this </v>

833
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:45.600
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

834
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.493
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to really be a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hate or the rancor and by that same </v>

835
00:36:49.501 --> 00:36:51.050
<v Speaker 2>token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll defend Donald Trump too.</v>

836
00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:51.943
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

837
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:52.853
<v Speaker 2>I find myself defending people I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>support who were unfairly attacked more </v>

838
00:36:56.551 --> 00:36:57.840
<v Speaker 2>than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

839
00:36:57.841 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really depressing,</v>

840
00:36:59.581 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 2>but it kind of shows how we got where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

841
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.800
<v Speaker 2>By that same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very fact that Bernie Sanders can go</v>

842
00:37:04.801 --> 00:37:08.030
<v Speaker 2>this far in the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he packed in 20,000</v>

843
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.790
<v Speaker 2>in a stadium in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Sacramento last night with 10,000</v>

844
00:37:11.791 --> 00:37:12.420
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

845
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Of course the media didn't cover this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the very fact that a,</v>

846
00:37:15.861 --> 00:37:16.694
<v Speaker 2>a Jewish self-described democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialists can do that well in this day </v>

847
00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:24.300
<v Speaker 2>and age shows the power of the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and online social media.</v>

848
00:37:24.301 --> 00:37:25.980
<v Speaker 2>And it shows how far we've come as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

849
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.993
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strides lgbt people have made in my </v>

850
00:37:28.861 --> 00:37:29.694
<v Speaker 2>lifetime from when I was a teenager </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in New York in the eighties and </v>

851
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:35.310
<v Speaker 2>seeing the beginning of aids activism to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sitting president,</v>

852
00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Dorsey marriage equality during a heated</v>
<v Speaker 2>reelection battle.</v>

853
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.990
<v Speaker 2>That's why I still believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American dream because I've seen people,</v>

854
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:43.853
<v Speaker 2>not politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people make this kind of change </v>

855
00:37:45.301 --> 00:37:45.820
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

856
00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:46.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

857
00:37:46.511 --> 00:37:47.344
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because right where you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 10 feet from you or when I had </v>

858
00:37:50.471 --> 00:37:53.350
<v Speaker 1>my show on Sirius Xm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the first time we had met</v>

859
00:37:53.351 --> 00:37:55.390
<v Speaker 1>or maybe we did stand up one or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>times together,</v>

860
00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.373
<v Speaker 1>but you came on my show and we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about marriage equality and you </v>

861
00:37:58.811 --> 00:38:01.690
<v Speaker 1>were laying out such a good case for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was four years before it happened</v>

862
00:38:01.691 --> 00:38:03.760
<v Speaker 1>and it seemed sort of edgy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're now,</v>

863
00:38:03.761 --> 00:38:06.670
<v Speaker 1>it seems the norm and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism is supposed to be.</v>

864
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:07.801
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

865
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:08.634
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was liberals in the Republican Party </v>

866
00:38:10.081 --> 00:38:11.160
<v Speaker 2>who ended slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

867
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

868
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:15.180
<v Speaker 2>liberals in both parties who fought for </v>
<v Speaker 2>civil rights.</v>

869
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:16.014
<v Speaker 2>It was conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So both parties who fought against the </v>

870
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:19.440
<v Speaker 2>civil rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

871
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:20.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

872
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's messy.</v>

873
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.670
<v Speaker 2>And like I said at the beginning of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

874
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:24.803
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all progressive in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways and conservative and other ways </v>

875
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.100
<v Speaker 2>that billy's most sane people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

876
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

877
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:31.104
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot to be inspired by in my </v>

878
00:38:32.491 --> 00:38:33.324
<v Speaker 2>life and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to remind myself that I am a </v>

879
00:38:35.681 --> 00:38:36.514
<v Speaker 2>recovering cynic and I don't ever want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go back to being so dark again and </v>

880
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm catching a lot of heat for it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

881
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in talking about Donald trump who is not</v>

882
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 2>a conservative Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just not,</v>

883
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:49.840
<v Speaker 2>he's a horrible human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you would ever told me,</v>

884
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:50.674
<v Speaker 2>Dave Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had ever told me that there'd be </v>

885
00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:52.864
<v Speaker 2>a guy on stage at a Republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential debate saying that Bush </v>

886
00:38:56.741 --> 00:38:57.574
<v Speaker 2>lied us into war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that planned parenthood does a </v>

887
00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:02.170
<v Speaker 2>lot of good things for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for women saying that,</v>

888
00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:03.004
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hedge fund managers and </v>

889
00:39:04.181 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 2>billionaires like himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be taxed more.</v>

890
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have believed it.</v>

891
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.213
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grover norquist is clutching his pearls </v>

892
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.010
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of this.</v>

893
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.070
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the third right did the same thing.</v>

894
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 2>And I think anyone who compares people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Nazis is worse than Hitler.</v>

895
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.910
<v Speaker 2>But I will say a third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right rose to power by,</v>

896
00:39:21.911 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by running against the Weimar republic.</v>

897
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 2>And promising so many conservatives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many liberals,</v>

898
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:27.544
<v Speaker 2>whatever they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people just kinda got caught up in </v>

899
00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:32.650
<v Speaker 2>the emotion of it and this feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>national pride.</v>

900
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not to compare the Obama </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration to the Weimar Republic.</v>

901
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:39.340
<v Speaker 2>They're much more confident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the parallels are really,</v>

902
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:40.174
<v Speaker 2>really similar because Donald trump has </v>
<v Speaker 2>promised as much good progressive stuff </v>

903
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.050
<v Speaker 2>as he's promised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservative stuff.</v>

904
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.973
<v Speaker 1>So talking about trump and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>running on emotion and not policy and </v>

905
00:39:48.521 --> 00:39:49.354
<v Speaker 1>kind of giving everybody everything they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want and being to the left of what most </v>

906
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are yet still winning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>republican primaries and all that.</v>

907
00:39:56.501 --> 00:39:57.334
<v Speaker 1>You had an interesting moment that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>touched on right at the top of the </v>

908
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:04.300
<v Speaker 1>etch-a-sketch sketch moment of the Mitt </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romney campaign where basically you were</v>

909
00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:08.440
<v Speaker 1>on CNN and you questioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it Romney's campaign manager?</v>

910
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Who Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Communications director,</v>

911
00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance.</v>

912
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically you said to him,</v>

913
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys have been saying all this bad </v>

914
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:19.540
<v Speaker 1>stuff about each other and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican primaries and how do you move</v>

915
00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:21.280
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was sort of the gist of it.</v>

916
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:21.971
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

917
00:40:21.971 --> 00:40:23.110
<v Speaker 1>it's an etch a sketch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

918
00:40:23.111 --> 00:40:25.060
<v Speaker 1>And you can just sort of forget all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

919
00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:25.894
<v Speaker 1>And reset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to clean up the mess that I </v>

920
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.813
<v Speaker 1>created for you there?</v>

921
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got it.</v>

922
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:29.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

923
00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:29.973
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a bit sneaky on my part because </v>

924
00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:32.883
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that I wanted to ask a question </v>

925
00:40:35.951 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 2>that I hadn't heard asked before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the time everyone was saying,</v>

926
00:40:39.371 --> 00:40:41.500
<v Speaker 2>is Mitt Romney Conservative enough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>

927
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.210
<v Speaker 2>that was where all the mainstream media </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going.</v>

928
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:44.223
<v Speaker 2>You've got Gingrich and Santorum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Mitt Romney really conservative </v>

929
00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:47.644
<v Speaker 2>enough because main,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most mainstream media will never stop </v>

930
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:52.450
<v Speaker 2>chasing Fox News as audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

931
00:40:52.451 --> 00:40:55.590
<v Speaker 2>and my whole thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't Mitt Romney to conservative?</v>

932
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.453
<v Speaker 2>Has any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has any painted himself into an </v>

933
00:40:57.971 --> 00:41:00.890
<v Speaker 2>ideological quarter in this campaign by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

934
00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.980
<v Speaker 2>it was easier to run against mccain in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2000.</v>

935
00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays these guys in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

936
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

937
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.240
<v Speaker 2>starting in 2008 now in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

938
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:11.103
<v Speaker 2>you're up against Gingrich and Santorum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to be something you're </v>

939
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:14.044
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same problem that every </v>

940
00:41:15.491 --> 00:41:16.324
<v Speaker 2>Republican nominee is going to have for </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a while when the tea party is </v>

941
00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:20.170
<v Speaker 2>controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're nominating process,</v>

942
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.173
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like the gop is gonna have </v>

943
00:41:24.161 --> 00:41:27.010
<v Speaker 2>a tough time getting non lunatics </v>
<v Speaker 2>nominated for president.</v>

944
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Democrats have a different problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody shows up to vote in midterms.</v>

945
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:30.873
<v Speaker 2>So both parties are kind of screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we're looking at </v>

946
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.920
<v Speaker 2>potentially a generation of democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidents and Republican congresses.</v>

947
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.091
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

948
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I asked it in a,</v>

949
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.840
<v Speaker 2>in a very wordy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>newsy bs kind of way.</v>

950
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to my shock,</v>

951
00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:46.430
<v Speaker 2>he came out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

952
00:41:46.431 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 2>you get to the midterm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to the general.</v>

953
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:48.540
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

954
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.350
<v Speaker 2>it's like a reset button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an intro sketch.</v>

955
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.193
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had just admitted that Mitt Romney </v>

956
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:58.380
<v Speaker 2>had the ideology of the guy from a Mento</v>
<v Speaker 2>lift,</v>

957
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 2>like a crack house mattress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He changed positions like a,</v>

958
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.950
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a yoga teacher,</v>

959
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.710
<v Speaker 2>untainted meth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

960
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went home after the taping.</v>

961
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I was doing mornings every day on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by that afternoon,</v>

962
00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the clip had been shown everywhere I was</v>

963
00:42:13.191 --> 00:42:16.850
<v Speaker 2>sitting in a cafe with my wife and baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that I saw myself on tv,</v>

964
00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone began running it.</v>

965
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:19.423
<v Speaker 2>It was on the daily show and cold beer </v>
<v Speaker 2>that night and all the big networks and </v>

966
00:42:21.851 --> 00:42:24.620
<v Speaker 2>I was getting calls from Europe and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>get sales went up,</v>

967
00:42:24.621 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 2>I believe 16,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent on Amazon that night.</v>

968
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.600
<v Speaker 2>You get a cut of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not get a cut of that,</v>

969
00:42:29.601 --> 00:42:32.570
<v Speaker 2>but I was asked to sign lots of veggies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sketches for the next two years at every</v>

970
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 2>one of my tour dates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

971
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:35.114
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was proud to be a minor </v>

972
00:42:37.311 --> 00:42:38.750
<v Speaker 2>historical footnote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

973
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.613
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the sort of thing that Republican </v>

974
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 2>voters in the Democratic voters as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to be weary of,</v>

975
00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.960
<v Speaker 2>especially in a season when so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't trust trump or hillary.</v>

976
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:48.933
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what you did with that </v>

977
00:42:50.291 --> 00:42:51.124
<v Speaker 1>question was you pulled the mask off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the endless bullshit because you </v>

978
00:42:55.001 --> 00:42:58.750
<v Speaker 1>basically said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to say some stuff to get through</v>

979
00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:01.120
<v Speaker 1>and look at the Democrats have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

980
00:43:01.121 --> 00:43:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I get you with the Republicans and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tea party,</v>

981
00:43:02.831 --> 00:43:03.664
<v Speaker 1>they dragged them to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the Democrats have the same </v>

982
00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:06.334
<v Speaker 1>problem now where they're being led by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the far left and that goes to the point </v>

983
00:43:10.211 --> 00:43:11.830
<v Speaker 1>where we were talking about with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary,</v>

984
00:43:11.831 --> 00:43:14.230
<v Speaker 1>where they are going to demonize her and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then depressed.</v>

985
00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.290
<v Speaker 1>They're actual people from from showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

986
00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:19.510
<v Speaker 1>So I think both parties have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

987
00:43:19.511 --> 00:43:20.344
<v Speaker 1>but you expose this thing and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like four years later trump has just </v>

988
00:43:24.611 --> 00:43:28.480
<v Speaker 1>blown the whole thing apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there is no more a,</v>

989
00:43:28.481 --> 00:43:29.314
<v Speaker 1>we have to pretend we're this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump is just like I say whatever I </v>

990
00:43:31.631 --> 00:43:32.464
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all love it and I'm just going to </v>

991
00:43:33.011 --> 00:43:36.010
<v Speaker 1>keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I change my position every week.</v>

992
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:37.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he will continue to change </v>

993
00:43:37.951 --> 00:43:39.360
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's already done it this week.</v>

994
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure that Bernie has led the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole Party to the far left,</v>

995
00:43:42.511 --> 00:43:43.344
<v Speaker 2>so I kinda think Bush and Cheney push </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country a lot more left to tell you </v>

996
00:43:46.171 --> 00:43:47.004
<v Speaker 2>the truth and I don't think Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sanders has sent anything too </v>

997
00:43:49.051 --> 00:43:49.884
<v Speaker 2>outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really advocating for things that </v>

998
00:43:51.961 --> 00:43:52.794
<v Speaker 2>have worked in other countries that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>our capitalist allies and for things </v>

999
00:43:56.101 --> 00:43:58.560
<v Speaker 2>that have worked here in the past under </v>
<v Speaker 2>President Eisenhower.</v>

1000
00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly,</v>

1001
00:43:59.291 --> 00:44:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that Bernie necessarily is</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading it,</v>

1002
00:44:01.511 --> 00:44:02.344
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that movement that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind him is leading him in a way that </v>

1003
00:44:05.501 --> 00:44:06.334
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that he fully grasps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that some of the social justice </v>

1004
00:44:09.161 --> 00:44:09.994
<v Speaker 1>stuff and just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavior of the far left is not </v>

1005
00:44:13.241 --> 00:44:15.400
<v Speaker 1>behavior that he uses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted once,</v>

1006
00:44:15.401 --> 00:44:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I wish that I liked Bernie supporters as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much as I like Bernie.</v>

1007
00:44:18.941 --> 00:44:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I think he is a pretty decent guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's being led by the.</v>

1008
00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.690
<v Speaker 1>By.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go ahead.</v>

1009
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's being led.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his campaign is being tainted by</v>

1010
00:44:27.071 --> 00:44:29.560
<v Speaker 2>some of his followers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's fair circumstances here.</v>

1011
00:44:29.561 --> 00:44:30.394
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no idea how of these online </v>

1012
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:32.754
<v Speaker 2>trolls are actually republicans </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending to be Bernie supporters </v>

1013
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:37.920
<v Speaker 2>because I do wound hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mom tells mom,</v>

1014
00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:39.450
<v Speaker 2>always said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't talk to strange eggs,</v>

1015
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.353
<v Speaker 2>are right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to any eggs with 20 followers </v>

1016
00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:44.154
<v Speaker 2>because they're trolls and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's whoever owns them as a whole </v>

1017
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:47.400
<v Speaker 2>basket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1018
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:48.450
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1019
00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.990
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these same situations apply to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton supporters as well.</v>

1020
00:44:51.991 --> 00:44:52.824
<v Speaker 2>There is uncommon hostility towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie supporters from tons of Hillary </v>

1021
00:44:55.861 --> 00:44:56.694
<v Speaker 2>supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the generational divide in Hillary </v>

1022
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Clinton's campaign has been fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1023
00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:07.401
<v Speaker 2>there've been studies showing that women</v>
<v Speaker 2>over 45 have waited their whole life for</v>

1024
00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:10.980
<v Speaker 2>a woman president and they've worked for</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and they need,</v>

1025
00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 2>they really want this to happen.</v>

1026
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:13.103
<v Speaker 2>And I respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the same studies show that women </v>

1027
00:45:15.061 --> 00:45:15.894
<v Speaker 2>under 45 know that in their lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be a woman president and </v>

1028
00:45:20.521 --> 00:45:22.380
<v Speaker 2>they'd all go for Elizabeth Warren in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

1029
00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:23.953
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't totally trust this woman </v>

1030
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:27.490
<v Speaker 2>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

1031
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real reckoning that,</v>

1032
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our country is going to have to face.</v>

1033
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I kind of am inclined to believe day </v>
<v Speaker 2>that whoever gets the job is going to be</v>

1034
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:35.064
<v Speaker 2>a one term punching bag because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know who could enact a kind of sweeping </v>

1035
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:40.853
<v Speaker 2>reform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to actually restore the middle </v>

1036
00:45:42.521 --> 00:45:43.354
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're sort of in the golden age of </v>

1037
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:47.100
<v Speaker 2>gradual improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hailed as sweeping reform.</v>

1038
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I think Bernie Sanders was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was advising them,</v>

1039
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:50.754
<v Speaker 2>I would tell them to take a one term </v>
<v Speaker 2>pledge and then just say that once he </v>

1040
00:45:53.521 --> 00:45:54.354
<v Speaker 2>got in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just going to executive order us </v>

1041
00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.580
<v Speaker 2>into having a middleclass again and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>

1042
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.160
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the smartest thing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do what trump is,</v>

1043
00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:03.930
<v Speaker 1>but when you be okay with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1044
00:46:03.931 --> 00:46:04.764
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the executive branch getting more and </v>

1045
00:46:06.121 --> 00:46:10.050
<v Speaker 1>more power because almost every </v>
<v Speaker 1>president at this point takes more power</v>

1046
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:12.600
<v Speaker 1>for that branch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you think about the emphasis</v>

1047
00:46:12.601 --> 00:46:13.920
<v Speaker 1>that we put on the presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

1048
00:46:13.921 --> 00:46:15.330
<v Speaker 1>there are only a third of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

1049
00:46:15.331 --> 00:46:17.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we barely ever talk about,</v>

1050
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:19.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Senate and the Congress,</v>

1051
00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:20.274
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We barely talked about the supreme </v>

1052
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:22.830
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of giving the president more</v>

1053
00:46:22.831 --> 00:46:23.664
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you fear that because somebody that </v>

1054
00:46:25.501 --> 00:46:28.470
<v Speaker 1>you didn't like it then get into office </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you wouldn't be happy about it,</v>

1055
00:46:28.471 --> 00:46:28.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1056
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Argument for reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1057
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:34.260
<v Speaker 2>All the Democrats who were demanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Harry Reid and the Filibuster,</v>

1058
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1059
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:39.090
<v Speaker 2>when the Democrats had to send it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so grateful they didn't because it gives</v>

1060
00:46:39.091 --> 00:46:39.924
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats some leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never had this level of </v>

1061
00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:44.010
<v Speaker 2>obstruction before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And congressional history.</v>

1062
00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:44.844
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton broke the record for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most filibusters against the president </v>

1063
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:49.643
<v Speaker 2>in US history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had more than every other president </v>

1064
00:46:51.001 --> 00:46:52.650
<v Speaker 2>combined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And under Obama,</v>

1065
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.513
<v Speaker 2>it's already tops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton in Obama's first term and top </v>

1066
00:46:55.441 --> 00:46:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this isn't,</v>

1067
00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.013
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about big government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about good government and </v>

1068
00:47:00.481 --> 00:47:01.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1069
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:03.840
<v Speaker 2>I know that things move slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are designed to move slow.</v>

1070
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.530
<v Speaker 2>But I just spent a couple of years of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life working on a film for pbs about the</v>

1071
00:47:07.531 --> 00:47:08.364
<v Speaker 2>American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We retraced Alexis de Tocqueville's </v>

1072
00:47:10.801 --> 00:47:14.850
<v Speaker 2>journey in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>31 and interviewed over 200 people in 55</v>

1073
00:47:14.851 --> 00:47:16.200
<v Speaker 2>cities in 17 states.</v>

1074
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.660
<v Speaker 2>About what the American dream was and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is now,</v>

1075
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:19.973
<v Speaker 2>and it's one thing for me to sit in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>radio or a TV studio and be lofty about </v>

1076
00:47:22.921 --> 00:47:24.390
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually having good on the road for</v>

1077
00:47:24.391 --> 00:47:25.224
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The American dream is not what it once </v>

1078
00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:28.134
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were raised to believe that we were </v>

1079
00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 2>in a country where you could work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play by the rules,</v>

1080
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:32.614
<v Speaker 2>and you would prosper and your children </v>
<v Speaker 2>could know that they were going to have </v>

1081
00:47:37.061 --> 00:47:41.950
<v Speaker 2>a higher standard of living than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After 35 years of deregulation,</v>

1082
00:47:41.951 --> 00:47:44.140
<v Speaker 2>of outsourcing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Deindustrialization,</v>

1083
00:47:44.141 --> 00:47:44.974
<v Speaker 2>of automation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of jobs being shipped away that are </v>

1084
00:47:46.751 --> 00:47:49.780
<v Speaker 2>never coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the American dream anymore.</v>

1085
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:53.230
<v Speaker 2>It's gone from prosperity to survival </v>
<v Speaker 2>for millions.</v>

1086
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:54.183
<v Speaker 2>Retirement doesn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The middle class is now just the top of </v>

1087
00:47:56.831 --> 00:48:01.390
<v Speaker 2>the bottom and it doesn't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>this way and if policies got us here,</v>

1088
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.433
<v Speaker 2>policies could get us out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I fear we being the slow learning </v>

1089
00:48:05.561 --> 00:48:08.980
<v Speaker 2>monkeys that we are going to have to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot worse before it gets better.</v>

1090
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:09.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been a theme that I've talked to </v>

1091
00:48:11.251 --> 00:48:12.084
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people about that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that I really respect and like </v>

1092
00:48:14.821 --> 00:48:18.480
<v Speaker 1>are saying that it's going to get worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>before it gets better and everything you</v>

1093
00:48:18.481 --> 00:48:19.314
<v Speaker 1>just described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you are on the left or the </v>

1094
00:48:21.781 --> 00:48:22.614
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it explains both Bernie and trump </v>

1095
00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:29.700
<v Speaker 1>because it's about people are voting or </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least expressing themselves about the</v>

1096
00:48:29.701 --> 00:48:32.220
<v Speaker 1>broken system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the policies.</v>

1097
00:48:32.221 --> 00:48:34.110
<v Speaker 1>That's why it doesn't matter what trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>says.</v>

1098
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:37.200
<v Speaker 1>He's just saying something and for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie people,</v>

1099
00:48:37.201 --> 00:48:38.034
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter whether the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually has the authority to do these </v>

1100
00:48:41.011 --> 00:48:41.844
<v Speaker 1>things and change the banking system the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way he wants to and all of this stuff </v>

1101
00:48:44.701 --> 00:48:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and the minimum wage thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the president can't just do with a</v>

1102
00:48:47.101 --> 00:48:47.934
<v Speaker 1>pen.</v>

1103
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Essential Kennedy talking about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform for position.</v>

1104
00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:52.970
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1105
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.863
<v Speaker 2>if you go for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the American people saying that's </v>

1106
00:48:55.581 --> 00:48:57.110
<v Speaker 2>what we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know.</v>

1107
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.110
<v Speaker 2>We know that the government doesn't care</v>
<v Speaker 2>about democracy.</v>

1108
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.003
<v Speaker 2>Go back to Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what the American people voted for </v>

1109
00:49:02.661 --> 00:49:04.490
<v Speaker 2>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Closing Gitmo.</v>

1110
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.710
<v Speaker 2>The American people voted for a public </v>
<v Speaker 2>option.</v>

1111
00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.650
<v Speaker 2>The American people voted for higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes on the wealthy.</v>

1112
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:10.723
<v Speaker 2>Obama had to wait until he was elected </v>
<v Speaker 2>twice before he could just restore tax </v>

1113
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.900
<v Speaker 2>codes to Clinton levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1114
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:17.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1115
00:49:17.261 --> 00:49:19.190
<v Speaker 2>they run on these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>

1116
00:49:19.191 --> 00:49:20.750
<v Speaker 2>once they were an officer not allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1117
00:49:20.751 --> 00:49:21.381
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1118
00:49:21.381 --> 00:49:23.970
<v Speaker 2>what about the will of the voters so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1119
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.060
<v Speaker 2>that does come into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the case of trump,</v>

1120
00:49:26.061 --> 00:49:26.894
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating because he's proved </v>
<v Speaker 2>once and for all that nobody hates </v>

1121
00:49:29.511 --> 00:49:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Republican politicians more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican primary voters.</v>

1122
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.053
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's something sort of beautiful </v>

1123
00:49:35.381 --> 00:49:36.214
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm conflicted about the </v>

1124
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:38.134
<v Speaker 1>whole thing because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the idea of this person </v>

1125
00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:42.813
<v Speaker 1>that I don't know really what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>believes in and is using the media in </v>

1126
00:49:46.811 --> 00:49:51.280
<v Speaker 1>such a crass and sort of dishonest way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time,</v>

1127
00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:52.143
<v Speaker 1>all of these leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a fan of any of the mainstream </v>

1128
00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Republicans beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So watching them all kind of crumble and</v>

1129
00:49:57.131 --> 00:50:00.250
<v Speaker 1>watching all the talking heads on all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cable news networks,</v>

1130
00:50:00.251 --> 00:50:03.190
<v Speaker 1>watching the same people who got </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything wrong six months ago now.</v>

1131
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Now they're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1132
00:50:04.661 --> 00:50:06.990
<v Speaker 1>You can see fear in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I watched them,</v>

1133
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I watched them on CNN and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1134
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:11.043
<v Speaker 1>you can tell they're afraid for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs now because they've all been </v>

1135
00:50:12.941 --> 00:50:16.360
<v Speaker 1>phoning it in for years for the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're afraid.</v>

1136
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy can come in,</v>

1137
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:18.250
<v Speaker 1>we can be out of a Gig.</v>

1138
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watching the Republican races,</v>

1139
00:50:20.781 --> 00:50:24.260
<v Speaker 2>like watching Batman v Superman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who I'm rooting for.</v>

1140
00:50:24.261 --> 00:50:27.110
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1141
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.890
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1142
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:28.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that sense it's revealed a lot of </v>

1143
00:50:29.751 --> 00:50:30.470
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1144
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:31.480
<v Speaker 2>the discontented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1145
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 2>we can't forget that the first ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>third party president got into the White</v>

1146
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:36.793
<v Speaker 2>House with only 38 percent of the vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was a republican and it was </v>

1147
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln and the two party do wobbly is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of people don't trust.</v>

1148
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:45.283
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe trump could have done better if </v>

1149
00:50:46.431 --> 00:50:47.480
<v Speaker 2>he'd run as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

1150
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a third party independent.</v>

1151
00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Although he did that before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

1152
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:52.940
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get anywhere with it,</v>

1153
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.043
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1154
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.000
<v Speaker 2>that was before he became a reality TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>star.</v>

1155
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.163
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1156
00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:01.550
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess if I was advising the Republican</v>

1157
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1158
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I think the smartest thing we've heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from William Kristol,</v>

1159
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:08.203
<v Speaker 2>which I'm kind of liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you have broken clocks that are </v>

1160
00:51:11.061 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 2>right more than him.</v>

1161
00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.720
<v Speaker 2>The fact is William Kristol is leading </v>
<v Speaker 2>this consortium of Republicans trying to</v>

1162
00:51:19.581 --> 00:51:20.414
<v Speaker 2>persuade a mainstream well known </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican leader who's out of the game </v>

1163
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:24.853
<v Speaker 2>to make a third party run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their fear is that I'll even more </v>

1164
00:51:27.711 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 2>republicans are going to stay home this </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1165
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:30.733
<v Speaker 2>Then stayed home for Romney in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not forget Gary Johnson to time </v>

1166
00:51:34.251 --> 00:51:38.480
<v Speaker 2>elected governor of New Mexico who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>only invited to I think two or three gop</v>

1167
00:51:38.481 --> 00:51:43.400
<v Speaker 2>debates and all of 2012 ran as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the Libertarian Party candidate got a</v>

1168
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 2>million votes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark my words,</v>

1169
00:51:44.751 --> 00:51:45.584
<v Speaker 2>Dave Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary Johnson's going to get more than a </v>

1170
00:51:46.671 --> 00:51:47.504
<v Speaker 2>million votes this year and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified of more disaffected </v>

1171
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:50.894
<v Speaker 2>Republicans staying home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the movement and the New York Times </v>

1172
00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:55.910
<v Speaker 2>wrote a whole piece about it is to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1173
00:51:55.911 --> 00:51:56.744
<v Speaker 2>a Rick Perry to run as a third party </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing he'll never get it to fall on </v>

1174
00:52:00.681 --> 00:52:01.514
<v Speaker 2>his sword,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their fear is that Donald Trump is </v>

1175
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:05.210
<v Speaker 2>not just going to cost them the White </v>
<v Speaker 2>House.</v>

1176
00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.790
<v Speaker 2>They're writing that off there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're afraid of losing the Senate.</v>

1177
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:09.223
<v Speaker 2>So if you can get a Rick Perry or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractive well known conservative to </v>

1178
00:52:12.231 --> 00:52:13.064
<v Speaker 2>run to at least get the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives out of the house so </v>

1179
00:52:15.861 --> 00:52:16.694
<v Speaker 2>they'll still vote and then vote are all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way down tickets that could help </v>

1180
00:52:19.851 --> 00:52:20.684
<v Speaker 2>them save the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't be saying this because I </v>

1181
00:52:22.431 --> 00:52:25.100
<v Speaker 2>want them to lose the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a smart strategy.</v>

1182
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.033
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such intricate little moves and </v>

1183
00:52:28.861 --> 00:52:29.694
<v Speaker 1>machinations of the system and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're agreeing with the ideas of Bill </v>

1184
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Kristol to sort of take down trump</v>

1185
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:37.223
<v Speaker 2>be with the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a smart idea if they </v>

1186
00:52:38.731 --> 00:52:39.564
<v Speaker 2>want to keep the Senate</v>

1187
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:40.703
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I liked that you brought out Gary </v>

1188
00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had Gary Johnson on the show.</v>

1189
00:52:43.771 --> 00:52:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I think he is an extremely decent human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

1190
00:52:46.651 --> 00:52:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I've watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was one of the two people that</v>

1191
00:52:48.631 --> 00:52:51.310
<v Speaker 1>watched the libertarian debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1192
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:54.450
<v Speaker 1>what's your line on Libertarians?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a good line on Libertarians</v>

1193
00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:55.880
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of lines and libertarian.</v>

1194
00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:56.980
<v Speaker 1>They're liberals with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1195
00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:58.150
<v Speaker 1>something or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1196
00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.300
<v Speaker 2>and I think libertarian is just Latin </v>
<v Speaker 2>for embarrassed Republican.</v>

1197
00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.720
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my cat.</v>

1198
00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:06.570
<v Speaker 2>My cat just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1199
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:09.400
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're too stupid to get.</v>

1200
00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.940
<v Speaker 2>We'd all just be more selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick's,</v>

1201
00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:15.003
<v Speaker 2>oh look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A food appeared magically before me and </v>

1202
00:53:16.331 --> 00:53:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I did nothing for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met special and no one else had a role</v>

1203
00:53:19.301 --> 00:53:21.610
<v Speaker 2>in bringing my food to make you want the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine rand book.</v>

1204
00:53:21.611 --> 00:53:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I've got nine more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1205
00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.600
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the,</v>

1206
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I had the president of the Iron Ran </v>
<v Speaker 1>Institute on last week.</v>

1207
00:53:27.451 --> 00:53:28.284
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to watch the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll have you guys on together to </v>

1208
00:53:30.421 --> 00:53:31.254
<v Speaker 1>battle it out.</v>

1209
00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look out Somalia doing.</v>

1210
00:53:33.531 --> 00:53:36.740
<v Speaker 2>The fact is even if a libertarian became</v>
<v Speaker 2>elected president,</v>

1211
00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:38.990
<v Speaker 2>which won't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are never.</v>

1212
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:42.440
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can believe in religion and science.</v>

1213
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:45.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to claim you follow Ian </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rand and Jesus.</v>

1214
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1215
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Ran Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1216
00:53:48.561 --> 00:53:51.140
<v Speaker 2>ran away from libertarianism faster than</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ian Ran,</v>

1217
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:53.480
<v Speaker 2>ran to the mailbox for her social </v>
<v Speaker 2>security check.</v>

1218
00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.553
<v Speaker 2>No president is ever going to want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president who does away with social </v>

1219
00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:00.290
<v Speaker 2>security and Medicare and Medicaid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire social safety net.</v>

1220
00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.120
<v Speaker 2>It's never gonna happen.</v>

1221
00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.500
<v Speaker 1>So those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those types of things,</v>

1222
00:54:03.501 --> 00:54:05.960
<v Speaker 1>that would just be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a purist libertarian,</v>

1223
00:54:05.961 --> 00:54:06.794
<v Speaker 1>like every party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's ways of taking the sort of </v>

1224
00:54:08.391 --> 00:54:09.224
<v Speaker 1>ideals of libertarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of limited government and freeing up </v>

1225
00:54:12.741 --> 00:54:15.040
<v Speaker 1>business more things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1226
00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:15.913
<v Speaker 1>without necessarily destroying social </v>
<v Speaker 1>security and still allowing for some </v>

1227
00:54:18.681 --> 00:54:20.650
<v Speaker 1>safety net and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>

1228
00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1229
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.341
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1230
00:54:22.341 --> 00:54:23.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see.</v>

1231
00:54:23.031 --> 00:54:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1232
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.613
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked Dr Jill Stein and the Green </v>

1233
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:27.080
<v Speaker 2>party as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1234
00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:30.650
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see at least one debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>where all the third party,</v>

1235
00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Major,</v>
<v Speaker 2>third party candidates have to be on the</v>

1236
00:54:32.341 --> 00:54:35.300
<v Speaker 2>stage with the big too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what we're seeing here with both</v>

1237
00:54:35.301 --> 00:54:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Bernie and trump is a massive American </v>
<v Speaker 2>discontent with this.</v>

1238
00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:43.430
<v Speaker 2>A snake with two heads that's taken over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole game.</v>

1239
00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:46.850
<v Speaker 2>People don't trust the two party system </v>
<v Speaker 2>and believe me,</v>

1240
00:54:46.851 --> 00:54:47.684
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to be so sick of seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that picture of the trumps and the </v>

1241
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:50.183
<v Speaker 2>Clintons at the wedding laughing </v>
<v Speaker 2>together because it's the ultimate </v>

1242
00:54:52.581 --> 00:54:53.414
<v Speaker 2>signal of just how there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's us and there's them and most of </v>

1243
00:54:57.291 --> 00:55:00.290
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans and Democrats in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country are part of the US.</v>

1244
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's also why I.</v>

1245
00:55:02.491 --> 00:55:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had Gary Johnson on the show,</v>

1246
00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:05.363
<v Speaker 1>but I've tweeted several times and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to put the message out there that </v>

1247
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:10.530
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't love this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if this isn't your guy,</v>

1248
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:15.240
<v Speaker 1>if you guys get him to 15 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the general election is on,</v>

1249
00:55:15.241 --> 00:55:16.074
<v Speaker 1>they have to put him in the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably not gonna happen for </v>

1250
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Jill Stein because she's running what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>72 times already,</v>

1251
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:24.300
<v Speaker 1>but Gary Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this year,</v>

1252
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:25.283
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

1253
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.450
<v Speaker 2>once course she's run</v>

1254
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.720
<v Speaker 1>only only ones before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1255
00:55:27.721 --> 00:55:29.220
<v Speaker 1>One 72,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

1256
00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Gary,</v>

1257
00:55:30.991 --> 00:55:31.824
<v Speaker 1>Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think there's such discontent that </v>

1258
00:55:33.931 --> 00:55:34.764
<v Speaker 1>there's a chance that at some point they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could just get them to 15 percent and </v>

1259
00:55:37.411 --> 00:55:38.940
<v Speaker 1>they'd have to throw another voice in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1260
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.140
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not even making it about him as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as just give us another voice.</v>

1261
00:55:43.141 --> 00:55:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Give us another option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone let us here another idea.</v>

1262
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:47.873
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>

1263
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:50.400
<v Speaker 2>if the DNC wasn't walking around in </v>
<v Speaker 2>clown shoes,</v>

1264
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:53.550
<v Speaker 2>they would pour a lot of money into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to life parties because there's so</v>

1265
00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:54.384
<v Speaker 2>many social conservatives who only vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Republican party because of the </v>

1266
00:55:57.211 --> 00:55:58.044
<v Speaker 2>abortion issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Republican Party will never allow </v>

1267
00:56:00.301 --> 00:56:03.900
<v Speaker 2>abortion to become illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is their number one fundraising tool.</v>

1268
00:56:03.901 --> 00:56:07.040
<v Speaker 2>And Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as politicians have Mr Seuss,</v>

1269
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:09.780
<v Speaker 2>abortion will remain legal in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1270
00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:10.943
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can talk about that issue all day </v>

1271
00:56:12.361 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1272
00:56:13.411 --> 00:56:17.370
<v Speaker 2>to me why more conservatives don't bail </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Republican Party and go ahead and</v>

1273
00:56:17.371 --> 00:56:19.860
<v Speaker 2>vote right to light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're already a single issue voter.</v>

1274
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:21.443
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a grotesque hypocrite because Jesus out </v>

1275
00:56:23.591 --> 00:56:24.424
<v Speaker 2>against the death penalty never </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned abortion and got technically </v>

1276
00:56:27.461 --> 00:56:29.140
<v Speaker 2>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prolife character in the Bible,</v>

1277
00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:31.930
<v Speaker 2>but that's a whole other matter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1278
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 2>the Bush family was never against </v>
<v Speaker 2>abortion rights,</v>

1279
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:36.770
<v Speaker 2>never against the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Donald Trump's not against,</v>

1280
00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:38.960
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1281
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.410
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put on this charade,</v>

1282
00:56:40.411 --> 00:56:42.700
<v Speaker 2>they shuffle it around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these social conservatives,</v>

1283
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:43.653
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alabama keeps voting for these people </v>

1284
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nothing changes.</v>

1285
00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Howard Dean was really smart with the 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>state strategy when he ran the DNC.</v>

1286
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:53.283
<v Speaker 2>And a smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>charismatic Democrat would try to make </v>

1287
00:56:55.361 --> 00:56:56.920
<v Speaker 2>inroads down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me,</v>

1288
00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.053
<v Speaker 2>if social conservatives who watch Fox </v>
<v Speaker 2>News could hear a Bernie Sanders speech </v>

1289
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:01.743
<v Speaker 2>unedited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find themselves nodding every bit </v>

1290
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:05.530
<v Speaker 2>as much as they do with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only with Bernie.</v>

1291
00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 2>It's policy with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just personality.</v>

1292
00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.033
<v Speaker 1>So how much of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about the personality </v>

1293
00:57:11.081 --> 00:57:11.914
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I really believe this election is </v>

1294
00:57:12.821 --> 00:57:16.300
<v Speaker 1>going to be one on the personality thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not on substance in any way.</v>

1295
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:17.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of this is just the times we </v>

1296
00:57:18.611 --> 00:57:19.444
<v Speaker 1>live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that we're all at twitter </v>

1297
00:57:20.381 --> 00:57:21.214
<v Speaker 1>expressing ourselves all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all that everyone's on facebook </v>

1298
00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:25.443
<v Speaker 1>posting articles and fighting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in banning people in muting </v>

1299
00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:29.590
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is just noise?</v>

1300
00:57:29.591 --> 00:57:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you have trouble?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1301
00:57:30.461 --> 00:57:31.294
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing your show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even sort of separating the noise from </v>

1302
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:36.130
<v Speaker 1>what's actually real.</v>

1303
00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's nothing new.</v>

1304
00:57:39.341 --> 00:57:40.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1305
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:44.080
<v Speaker 2>look back to how vicious Jefferson Adams</v>
<v Speaker 2>were against each other in the press.</v>

1306
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:45.213
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adams called out Jefferson for selling </v>

1307
00:57:46.481 --> 00:57:49.270
<v Speaker 2>his own children to slavery 200 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1308
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln was so despised.</v>

1309
00:57:51.371 --> 00:57:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Roosevelt and eleanor were as hated as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Clintons are.</v>

1310
00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:57.970
<v Speaker 2>All of this is really nothing new for </v>
<v Speaker 2>our country or our species.</v>

1311
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.590
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1312
00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:01.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like George Carlin said,</v>

1313
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:03.340
<v Speaker 2>when you're born you get a free ticket </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the free show.</v>

1314
00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trick is to not grow up enjoying the</v>

1315
00:58:05.351 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 2>freak show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1316
00:58:07.061 --> 00:58:08.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1317
00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:08.973
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of folks who are going to </v>

1318
00:58:10.481 --> 00:58:13.360
<v Speaker 2>have to patch up a lot of friendships </v>
<v Speaker 2>once this campaign is over and uh,</v>

1319
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1320
00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:15.363
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate my conservative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive brothers and sisters who </v>

1321
00:58:17.451 --> 00:58:18.284
<v Speaker 2>were able to talk about this stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>grownups and not let hate getting the </v>

1322
00:58:20.381 --> 00:58:21.210
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1323
00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not many of us though,</v>

1324
00:58:23.221 --> 00:58:25.200
<v Speaker 1>or I guess there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're the silent majority.</v>

1325
00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:26.034
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that I think actually most people </v>

1326
00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:29.423
<v Speaker 1>don't feel like you have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>purity of political purity tests to be </v>

1327
00:58:31.861 --> 00:58:32.694
<v Speaker 1>friends with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there do seem to be sides that want </v>

1328
00:58:35.581 --> 00:58:36.414
<v Speaker 1>that to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think actually most people are </v>

1329
00:58:38.041 --> 00:58:39.750
<v Speaker 1>willing to do this and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1330
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.833
<v Speaker 1>if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks at a couple of things that I </v>

1331
00:58:41.581 --> 00:58:44.280
<v Speaker 1>agree with and Ruben's at a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things I agree with and,</v>

1332
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.570
<v Speaker 1>and that's all right.</v>

1333
00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:47.450
<v Speaker 2>And that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

1334
00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1335
00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.140
<v Speaker 1>we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've only got a couple minutes left.</v>

1336
00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think's doing it better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>us?</v>

1337
00:58:53.241 --> 00:58:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Is there a country that you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now because you know,</v>

1338
00:58:56.061 --> 00:58:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Europe's got a whole slew of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

1339
00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:00.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>western Europe and Eastern Europe.</v>

1340
00:59:00.261 --> 00:59:01.520
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all over the world.</v>

1341
00:59:01.521 --> 00:59:02.720
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's got problems.</v>

1342
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Is there any system that you could go </v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys that's the,</v>

1343
00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:07.400
<v Speaker 1>that's the way we should be doing it.</v>

1344
00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:08.371
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1345
00:59:08.371 --> 00:59:09.204
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a lot of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the American dream has become the </v>

1346
00:59:11.491 --> 00:59:12.324
<v Speaker 2>Scandinavian dream and those are </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalist societies with strong safety </v>

1347
00:59:15.061 --> 00:59:18.900
<v Speaker 2>nets where you pay higher taxes but you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get stuff for your taxes here.</v>

1348
00:59:18.901 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 2>We think we pay low taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we pay high for everything else.</v>

1349
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might pay lower taxes than our </v>

1350
00:59:24.021 --> 00:59:24.854
<v Speaker 2>European friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you're paying for your </v>

1351
00:59:25.821 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 2>healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're paying for your senior care.</v>

1352
00:59:27.681 --> 00:59:30.110
<v Speaker 2>You're paying for your college loans for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of your life.</v>

1353
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Michael Moore's coming on my show today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year at Sirius Xm.</v>

1354
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.230
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I highly recommend his new film.</v>

1355
00:59:36.231 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Nobody saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called where to invade next.</v>

1356
00:59:38.751 --> 00:59:41.660
<v Speaker 2>And the idea of it is him going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different countries and stealing.</v>

1357
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:45.110
<v Speaker 2>They were good ideas and claiming it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>America because these other countries do</v>

1358
00:59:45.111 --> 00:59:45.944
<v Speaker 2>the American green better than we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still upward mobility in these </v>

1359
00:59:48.561 --> 00:59:49.930
<v Speaker 2>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1360
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:53.210
<v Speaker 2>Finland and Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then of course,</v>

1361
00:59:53.211 --> 00:59:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is considered the happiest country</v>

1362
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.030
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1363
00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:58.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1364
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.833
<v Speaker 2>I believe that America though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to abandon this country </v>

1365
01:00:00.351 --> 01:00:01.184
<v Speaker 2>for another one and I'm going to stick </v>
<v Speaker 2>around here and fight for decency and </v>

1366
01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 2>love and common sense.</v>

1367
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.823
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask you another question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of a pretty decent way </v>

1368
01:00:08.321 --> 01:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>to end the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny.</v>

1369
01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you dave.</v>

1370
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:12.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a pleasure to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope it wasn't.</v>

1371
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring lots of Dick Jokes next time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1372
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Next time we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll work blue,</v>

1373
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:18.103
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I look forward to coming on your </v>

1374
01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>show again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

1375
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:20.743
<v Speaker 1>as I said at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are the one that drags me to stand </v>
