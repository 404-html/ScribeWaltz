1
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were taking a break from politics</v>

2
00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:09.830
<v Speaker 1>this weekend we're going to focus on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>f word.</v>

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.500
<v Speaker 1>That's right food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

4
00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.540
<v Speaker 1>you are what you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that's true,</v>

5
00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>a lot of us are half hot dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half pizza and half ice cream.</v>

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.303
<v Speaker 1>I know that that's three halves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're a pretty fat group of people </v>

7
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:23.930
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every week there's a new diet to follow,</v>

8
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:27.710
<v Speaker 1>a new oil to avoid or a new super food </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll change your life.</v>

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Then the week after that we usually find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that the new revolutionary diet will</v>

10
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:32.504
<v Speaker 1>actually make you gain weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually need that oil to live and </v>

11
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:36.074
<v Speaker 1>the superfood does absolutely nothing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>an endless slew of magazines to the </v>

12
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.334
<v Speaker 1>countless websites and blogs devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping you clicking on the newest fad </v>

13
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.730
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes almost impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what you should eat.</v>

14
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>As those of you follow me on social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.203
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the midst of a little diet </v>

16
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a slow carb Paleo Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a slightly modified version of </v>

18
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>what form of Rubin report guest Tim </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferriss helped popularize.</v>

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating only meat,</v>

20
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>fish and veggies with no sugar and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited carbs.</v>

21
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.763
<v Speaker 1>I'm even putting grass fed butter in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee to get an extra boost of fat and </v>

22
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>energy in the morning as I'm taping this</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct message.</v>

23
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:14.144
<v Speaker 1>I've lost about five pounds in 10 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I've also punched for random </v>

24
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>strangers on the street for looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>me the wrong way,</v>

25
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>but as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in moderation.</v>

26
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should or shouldn't put in your</v>

27
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:28.880
<v Speaker 1>body isn't just about weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also about your mind,</v>

28
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>and this is a place where the science is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually pretty solid.</v>

29
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.833
<v Speaker 1>The foods that we eat or don't eat can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a tremendous effect on our brain </v>

30
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:37.064
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right down to our ability to think as </v>

31
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:39.974
<v Speaker 1>we've seen a spike in degenerative brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases such as Alzheimer's and </v>

32
00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:43.844
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are just two of the many forms of </v>

33
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>dementia.</v>

34
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.893
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming clearer and clearer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fueling our brains with the right foods </v>

35
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>and avoiding the wrong ones are a key to</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain health.</v>

36
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.023
<v Speaker 1>So much of what we talk about on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>show is related to clear and critical </v>

37
00:01:58.851 --> 00:01:59.684
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we may not think about how the </v>

38
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>food that we eat is affecting our brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a daily basis,</v>

39
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>feeding our brains the right foods is as</v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

40
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:08.534
<v Speaker 1>actually possibly more important than </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding our brains the right </v>

41
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:12.224
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this week we're going to learn some </v>

42
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:18.941
<v Speaker 1>information on what we should feed our </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains so that we're optimized to engage</v>

43
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.890
<v Speaker 1>in intellectual battles in the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

44
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Joining me to discuss this is an old </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of the show and author of the new</v>

45
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 1>book Genius Foods Max Lewkowicz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

46
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:29.864
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I put grass fed butter on an </v>

47
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:33.650
<v Speaker 1>avocado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprinkled with Goji Berries.</v>

48
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is a truth seeker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a self experimenter of brain food expert</v>

49
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>and author of the upcoming book Genius </v>
<v Speaker 1>Foods.</v>

50
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Max Ligonier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome back.</v>

51
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Thanks so much for having to the Rubin </v>
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>

52
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:52.614
<v Speaker 1>This is a back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although most of my audience now will </v>

53
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>not know you from the Rubin report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you used to do the old rubin report.</v>

54
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a real lifetime ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

55
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Back back in the day when it was a panel</v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

56
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>it was a panel show years ago on t y,</v>
<v Speaker 1>t I don't even know what we're doing.</v>

57
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I have almost no recollection of my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time.</v>

58
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

59
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time that I was on it though,</v>

60
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:15.684
<v Speaker 2>I would always have such a good time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always would think to myself like how </v>

61
00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:20.364
<v Speaker 2>good you are at what you do and so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>just so honored to be here in this new </v>

62
00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:25.230
<v Speaker 2>set and to see your success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

63
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you've just blown up.</v>

64
00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

65
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.773
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you and I feel the same and </v>

66
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that our paths have sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I've been on parallel tracks kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing together.</v>

68
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>You have a new book coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're going to talk about shortly.</v>

69
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.910
<v Speaker 1>The last time I saw you though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>was about two or two and a half years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

71
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>You had me eat some really nasty stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>on camera that you felt.</v>

72
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know why you had me eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you wanted me to.</v>

73
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did we eat?</v>

74
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Because you're doing a lot about food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

75
00:03:55.641 --> 00:03:57.240
<v Speaker 1>you're testing this stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

76
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.240
<v Speaker 1>We ate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ate Natto,</v>

77
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.290
<v Speaker 1>which</v>

78
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.123
<v Speaker 2>is a fermented soybean dish that is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>commonly consumed in Japan and that was </v>

79
00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:07.400
<v Speaker 2>my first time ever trying it because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

80
00:04:07.401 --> 00:04:09.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back where your old set was,</v>

81
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:13.700
<v Speaker 2>we were like a few blocks away from like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Japanese market and I was like,</v>

82
00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:15.620
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a great place to go and try to find</v>

83
00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:16.454
<v Speaker 2>this food that I've heard so much about </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of its purported health </v>

84
00:04:18.501 --> 00:04:20.750
<v Speaker 2>benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never tasted it and it's known for</v>

85
00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:23.420
<v Speaker 2>being particularly gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it smells like dirty socks.</v>

86
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.810
<v Speaker 2>And I knew that you were back at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>studio and I was like,</v>

87
00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

88
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.633
<v Speaker 2>there's no better time to try this </v>
<v Speaker 2>gnarly food than with my friend Dave </v>

89
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Ruben.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I brought it back and we tried it.</v>

90
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

91
00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:35.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you were that night</v>

92
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.430
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty nasty.</v>

93
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.443
<v Speaker 1>Mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pretty good eater and we're going </v>

94
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 1>to get a lot into the different types of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you should be eating.</v>

95
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Fermented food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously good,</v>

96
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.143
<v Speaker 1>but it was kinda like beans in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>gooey sticky sauce and it stunk to high </v>

97
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>hell you're saying it was good for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

98
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 2>It's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very good.</v>

99
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

100
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

101
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 2>it's the top known source of vitamin K </v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

102
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.123
<v Speaker 2>which is a really important vitamin for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a vitamin for maintaining calcium </v>

103
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:03.783
<v Speaker 2>homeostasis in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically keeping calcium and the parts </v>

104
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.484
<v Speaker 2>of your body where calcium should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like your bones and your teeth and out </v>

105
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 2>of your soft tissues like your kidneys </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your arteries and stuff like that.</v>

106
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's really good research on vitaminK</v>

107
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 2>two and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

108
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural is one of these foods.</v>

109
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 2>They eat it in one of the world's blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>zones.</v>

110
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.423
<v Speaker 2>So I just figured why not give it a try?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it has the consistency of </v>

111
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:27.370
<v Speaker 2>like baked beans with a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like personal</v>

112
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.340
<v Speaker 1>can swirled together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously not appealing.</v>

113
00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:32.174
<v Speaker 1>It's quite horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've had something here for you </v>

114
00:05:34.311 --> 00:05:36.200
<v Speaker 1>to taste on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Camera don't have been awesome.</v>

115
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Like kicking the ball back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

116
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first I thought,</v>

117
00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:42.074
<v Speaker 1>well we start off with before we get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book is I think sort of what you're </v>

118
00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:45.704
<v Speaker 1>doing is interesting because it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>parallels what I'm doing here where </v>

119
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.363
<v Speaker 1>we're watching mainstream media crumble </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are coming to people like me </v>

120
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:53.714
<v Speaker 1>perhaps in and Shapiro and Joe Rogan and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these alternate to hear about news </v>

121
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>and I also think that's happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>food world and the Diet world as well,</v>

122
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:03.614
<v Speaker 1>where you used to maybe watch the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightly news to find out what you're </v>

123
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>supposed to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the latest fad is,</v>

124
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>what oils you're not supposed to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

125
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.114
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now people are going to people like </v>

126
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I just mentioned,</v>

127
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Tim Ferriss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like you.</v>

128
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.043
<v Speaker 1>Did you sort of see that thing coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why you started getting into </v>

129
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:21.824
<v Speaker 1>this world and we'll talk a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your personal reasons why you got </v>

130
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:25.244
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a sec.</v>

131
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

132
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that,</v>

133
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

134
00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:31.590
<v Speaker 2>we live in a time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

135
00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:34.710
<v Speaker 2>and in a world where we have all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world's information at our fingertips at</v>

136
00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:36.960
<v Speaker 2>any given time with our smart phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

137
00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:40.620
<v Speaker 2>and research is out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>information wants to be free so,</v>

138
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas prior generations I feel like </v>

139
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.213
<v Speaker 2>know could have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have only received health </v>

140
00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:49.050
<v Speaker 2>information from the doctor or nutrition</v>
<v Speaker 2>information from the nutritionist.</v>

141
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

142
00:06:50.281 --> 00:06:51.114
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think things are different where </v>

143
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 2>people that are passionate and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

144
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.030
<v Speaker 2>do their homework in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just talking about going to know</v>

145
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.900
<v Speaker 2>media for their health information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

146
00:07:00.901 --> 00:07:03.030
<v Speaker 2>pub med is something that anybody can </v>
<v Speaker 2>search.</v>

147
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.790
<v Speaker 2>the research is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Everybody's going to be qualified to</v>

149
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 2>the degree that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

150
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.700
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

151
00:07:08.701 --> 00:07:11.010
<v Speaker 2>medical literature or even cut through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the jargon.</v>

152
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.821
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

153
00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:15.480
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot that people can glean from</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is readily available.</v>

154
00:07:15.481 --> 00:07:16.314
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways that I try to tell </v>

155
00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:19.074
<v Speaker 2>people to become educated about health </v>
<v Speaker 2>and science and research is to look at </v>

156
00:07:22.381 --> 00:07:23.214
<v Speaker 2>websites that put out university press </v>
<v Speaker 2>releases that often accompany studies </v>

157
00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:28.320
<v Speaker 2>like science daily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

158
00:07:28.321 --> 00:07:29.580
<v Speaker 2>our medical express.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

159
00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:30.414
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes when a study's released,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university will write a press </v>

160
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:34.494
<v Speaker 2>release that basically has the gist of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the study basically found in </v>

161
00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 2>layman's terms and that's often what </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists will use to write pieces for</v>

162
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.253
<v Speaker 2>the Huffington post or fast company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I tell people to do is cut out </v>

163
00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:48.180
<v Speaker 2>the middle man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the press releases,</v>

164
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.910
<v Speaker 2>read them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then go to the research article,</v>

165
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:51.863
<v Speaker 2>compare what you read in Layman's terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the press release to the research </v>

166
00:07:53.851 --> 00:07:56.130
<v Speaker 2>article and that can actually help you </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpret research.</v>

167
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>So the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll obviously,</v>

168
00:07:58.521 --> 00:07:59.354
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to do all that legwork </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's where someone like </v>

169
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:02.624
<v Speaker 1>you comes in going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will sit down and read all this stuff </v>

170
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>and now distill it to you in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it.</v>

171
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

172
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Speaker 2>my background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

173
00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:11.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

174
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.730
<v Speaker 2>before really diving into a health and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and fitness,</v>

175
00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:19.180
<v Speaker 2>I was a journalist at current TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was my first job out of college.</v>

176
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.390
<v Speaker 2>And so getting to work with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists there,</v>

177
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.680
<v Speaker 2>peabody award winning journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>award winning storytellers.</v>

179
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:27.963
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gave me a sense of how to ask </v>

180
00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:32.200
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to pick my sources,</v>

181
00:08:32.201 --> 00:08:35.320
<v Speaker 2>and then when I became interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and health,</v>

182
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

183
00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:41.530
<v Speaker 2>I kind of knew not only where to look </v>
<v Speaker 2>but how to look and um,</v>

184
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.731
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

185
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:45.340
<v Speaker 2>my unique job gave me the time and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability and you know,</v>

186
00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:49.540
<v Speaker 2>my personal circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

187
00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:51.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't expect everybody to do their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>

188
00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:52.900
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that people should do </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own research.</v>

189
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.280
<v Speaker 2>I do think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

190
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare healthcare is something that </v>

191
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:57.744
<v Speaker 2>we like to pretend that we're able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of offload to our healthcare </v>

192
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 2>providers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

193
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>But you don't go to a doctor to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>

194
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 2>You go to a doctor to become free of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease or to have a disease treated.</v>

195
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I think healthcare really is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

196
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.250
<v Speaker 2>starts in the kitchen and in the gym and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that we,</v>

198
00:09:15.251 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have to imbue our lives with day</v>

199
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:18.700
<v Speaker 2>to day.</v>

200
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I want it to start with that because</v>

201
00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:21.334
<v Speaker 1>I think it sets the table properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know on youtube there's a </v>

202
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.113
<v Speaker 1>million people talking about health and </v>
<v Speaker 1>diets and all that stuff and I want </v>

203
00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:28.234
<v Speaker 1>people to understand that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody that I know has been in this </v>

204
00:09:30.341 --> 00:09:32.980
<v Speaker 1>for a long time actually doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

205
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.100
<v Speaker 1>So let's go to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that personal circumstance part that you</v>

206
00:09:36.101 --> 00:09:38.020
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of got into this,</v>

207
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.253
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably only about five years ago </v>

208
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.870
<v Speaker 1>with the circumstances with your mom at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

209
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Can you take it from there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

210
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.233
<v Speaker 2>So when I left current TV to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out where I was going to go with </v>

211
00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:49.580
<v Speaker 2>my career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

212
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of in that downtime in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between jobs that um,</v>

213
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.320
<v Speaker 2>my mom started displaying very strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptoms that I couldn't explain.</v>

214
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problems with her memory.</v>

215
00:09:59.961 --> 00:10:00.794
<v Speaker 2>She complained of brain fog and she also</v>
<v Speaker 2>had changes to her gate that were very </v>

216
00:10:04.191 --> 00:10:04.701
<v Speaker 2>apparent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

217
00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:07.760
<v Speaker 2>my mom is a spirited New Yorker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Yorkers walk very fast.</v>

218
00:10:07.761 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 2>They walk everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

219
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.263
<v Speaker 2>and my mom ran a business so cognitively</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was always very sharp and </v>

220
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.833
<v Speaker 2>essentially what we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we saw is that my mom's cognition </v>

221
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.710
<v Speaker 2>took like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just seemed to have like,</v>

222
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a web browser with too many open </v>

223
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:25.750
<v Speaker 2>tabs is how I describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:26.350
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.183
<v Speaker 2>like a stuttering frame rate on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube video with a poor Internet </v>

226
00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:30.074
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>

227
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.350
<v Speaker 2>And my mom's gate changed where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:10:33.351 --> 00:10:34.184
<v Speaker 2>before she was a very fast walker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she almost developed sort of like a </v>

229
00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:37.844
<v Speaker 2>shuffle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And both of these strange symptoms </v>

230
00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:43.400
<v Speaker 2>seemed to come on at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had no prior family history of any</v>

231
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.870
<v Speaker 2>neurodegenerative disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dementia to me was not a term that I was</v>

232
00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:48.704
<v Speaker 2>familiar with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what else hammers disease </v>

233
00:10:49.851 --> 00:10:53.300
<v Speaker 2>was actually when I thought about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word dementia,</v>

234
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.360
<v Speaker 2>the one I thought about the character </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the addams family movie,</v>

235
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was like cousin it's or festers </v>

236
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.180
<v Speaker 2>like crush or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her name was dementia,</v>

237
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:03.800
<v Speaker 2>which was actually pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

238
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.910
<v Speaker 2>so coinciding with like my ignorance a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the time to go with my mom to some</v>

239
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:13.160
<v Speaker 2>of the top neurology departments in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

240
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.200
<v Speaker 2>We're very fortunate to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

241
00:11:15.201 --> 00:11:19.040
<v Speaker 2>We went to Nyu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia in New York,</v>

242
00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Johns Hopkins in Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cleveland Clinic.</v>

243
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm all in hopes of trying to find some </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of diagnosis for my mom,</v>

244
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.533
<v Speaker 2>see what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was in 2011 at the Cleveland </v>

245
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Clinic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

246
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:32.503
<v Speaker 2>where my mom was diagnosed with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurodegenerative disease for the first </v>

247
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:39.230
<v Speaker 2>time and she was prescribed drugs for </v>
<v Speaker 2>both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's</v>

248
00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:41.360
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at that moment,</v>

249
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean my world pretty much stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

250
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.990
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pretty chill guy that that weekend</v>

251
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.753
<v Speaker 2>or that week in Cleveland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the first time in my that I'd </v>

252
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:54.244
<v Speaker 2>ever had a panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just so freaked out by the </v>

253
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:58.144
<v Speaker 2>possibility that my mom had this fatal </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease for which there is no cure or </v>

254
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:03.034
<v Speaker 2>particularly meaningful treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I basically became unable to think </v>

255
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 2>about anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone my career.</v>

256
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 2>my mom started taking the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up coming back to La to try to,</v>

258
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look for jobs and do what it is that you</v>

259
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:19.840
<v Speaker 2>do when you live in La and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist on TV.</v>

260
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.090
<v Speaker 2>And I basically became unable to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about anything other than nutrition,</v>

261
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every waking minute that I wasn't,</v>

262
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something career related.</v>

263
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.064
<v Speaker 2>I was in pub Med digging through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>research and what I think really </v>

264
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:36.874
<v Speaker 2>motivated this journey for me was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that what I uncovered in the </v>

265
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 2>research was a stark contrast to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.010
<v Speaker 2>what neuroscientists Norman doidge calls</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurological nihilism to the,</v>

267
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.873
<v Speaker 2>to the despair and bleakness that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced in those doctor's offices </v>

268
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:53.040
<v Speaker 2>with my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you,</v>

269
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 2>can you describe what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they actually telling you?</v>

270
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

271
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:00.110
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it diagnose and adios.</v>

272
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Basically there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

273
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.213
<v Speaker 2>there's a quote that I learned that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>circulated amongst medical school </v>

274
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 2>medical school students that </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurologists don't treat disease.</v>

275
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:10.474
<v Speaker 2>They admire it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's because the brain is a mystery </v>

276
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.150
<v Speaker 2>for the most part.</v>

277
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean we know quite a bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

278
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:16.204
<v Speaker 2>which is surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot more unknowns than </v>

279
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 2>knowns at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and treatments for neurological diseases</v>

280
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 2>are very limited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

281
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.053
<v Speaker 2>there's no approved drug for Alzheimer's</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease that has a disease modifying </v>

282
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:31.590
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only act as bandaids,</v>

283
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 2>like chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bandaids,</v>

284
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:33.454
<v Speaker 2>essentially that work to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificially boost neurotransmitters in </v>

285
00:13:36.521 --> 00:13:37.354
<v Speaker 2>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they do nothing to solve the </v>

286
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:41.670
<v Speaker 2>underlying pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

287
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.140
<v Speaker 2>drug trials are notoriously bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pfizer just announced,</v>

288
00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:44.974
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to stop pursuing a </v>

289
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:52.090
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical treatments for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's disease because treating the</v>

290
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:56.750
<v Speaker 2>quest to find a drug to treat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease has like a 99 point six,</v>

291
00:13:56.751 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 2>two percent fail rate that's worse than </v>
<v Speaker 2>any other disease.</v>

292
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.760
<v Speaker 2>So meaning that they are getting out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the game altogether,</v>

293
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 2>they view this as something that can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be solved via drugs.</v>

294
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds incredible.</v>

295
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how often that happens with</v>
<v Speaker 2>other diseases.</v>

296
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 2>That sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds pretty staggering.</v>

297
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean another huge pharmaceutical </v>

298
00:14:12.731 --> 00:14:15.610
<v Speaker 2>company basically recently announced </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

299
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 2>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>X event.</v>

300
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

301
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a massive fell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

302
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:21.694
<v Speaker 2>So think about it from the perspective </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of an investor or are you </v>

303
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 2>going to invest in an Alzheimer's or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any drug trial that has,</v>

304
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 99 point six percent fail rate.</v>

305
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:31.774
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

306
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:32.973
<v Speaker 2>it's just not a smart investment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why Alzheimer's disease </v>

307
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:36.274
<v Speaker 2>research is criminally underfunded or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't say criminally if it makes </v>

308
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.140
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's tragic because you know,</v>

309
00:14:42.141 --> 00:14:42.974
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was a pill tomorrow that I </v>

310
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:46.720
<v Speaker 2>could give my mom that would help in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful way.</v>

311
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:47.883
<v Speaker 2>Of course I would want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it for all the 5 million people </v>

312
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Speaker 2>in America that are suffering from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's disease,</v>

313
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can bring almost anything back</v>

314
00:14:55.891 --> 00:14:56.724
<v Speaker 1>to politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is a good argument for </v>

315
00:14:59.071 --> 00:15:03.180
<v Speaker 1>publicly funded scientific research </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't have to deal with the</v>

316
00:15:03.181 --> 00:15:05.100
<v Speaker 1>bottom line where you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

317
00:15:05.101 --> 00:15:07.230
<v Speaker 1>these companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to deal with a bottom line and</v>

318
00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:11.070
<v Speaker 1>shareholders and they have to then stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point if,</v>

319
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.790
<v Speaker 1>if they can't get far enough where </v>
<v Speaker 1>something publicly funded,</v>

320
00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:16.680
<v Speaker 1>they can keep going to the science </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully.</v>

321
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.663
<v Speaker 1>Although you found that there are some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other ways to deal with this and that's </v>

322
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.510
<v Speaker 1>really what changed your life.</v>

323
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

324
00:15:22.381 --> 00:15:23.214
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw on the one hand I became really </v>

325
00:15:24.961 --> 00:15:26.600
<v Speaker 2>interested in learning about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

326
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.563
<v Speaker 2>potential diet and lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 2>interventions that I could throw my </v>

327
00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:31.554
<v Speaker 2>mom's way to sort of help her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then at the same time I became </v>

328
00:15:33.841 --> 00:15:34.674
<v Speaker 2>really conscious of my own brain health </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I learned that changes begin in </v>

329
00:15:37.291 --> 00:15:41.130
<v Speaker 2>the brain decades before the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptom of Alzheimer's disease,</v>

330
00:15:41.131 --> 00:15:44.370
<v Speaker 2>which is just one form of dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even Parkinson's disease,</v>

331
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.580
<v Speaker 2>by the time you show your first symptom </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Parkinson's disease,</v>

332
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.340
<v Speaker 2>half of the neurons involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>

333
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:51.603
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that part in the part of the brain </v>

334
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.140
<v Speaker 2>associated with Parkinson's disease are </v>
<v Speaker 2>already dead.</v>

335
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.360
<v Speaker 2>So these are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

336
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.203
<v Speaker 2>like any chronic disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are not diseases that develop </v>

337
00:15:59.701 --> 00:16:01.770
<v Speaker 2>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take years,</v>

338
00:16:01.771 --> 00:16:02.604
<v Speaker 2>if not decades to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I became really interested in doing </v>

339
00:16:04.981 --> 00:16:08.520
<v Speaker 2>what I could do in my own life to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximize my brain health so that I might</v>

340
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.010
<v Speaker 2>not have to deal with what it is at my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mom dealing with</v>

341
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.190
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go from there.</v>

342
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.550
<v Speaker 1>We'll slightly shift to your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously this is all intertwined.</v>

343
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:16.973
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the advanced copy of the book </v>

344
00:16:17.921 --> 00:16:18.754
<v Speaker 1>comes out in a couple of weeks and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a little bit and I just thought </v>

345
00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:23.860
<v Speaker 1>that the opening alone was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

346
00:16:23.861 --> 00:16:26.080
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just going to read the opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraph,</v>

347
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.910
<v Speaker 1>unless do you want to read it in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own voice?</v>

348
00:16:27.911 --> 00:16:28.744
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should.</v>

349
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.583
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let you read the opening </v>

350
00:16:31.061 --> 00:16:33.160
<v Speaker 1>paragraph of your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

351
00:16:33.161 --> 00:16:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was pretty beautiful.</v>

352
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.533
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm nestled within your skull mere </v>

353
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:40.064
<v Speaker 2>inches from your eyes are $86,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million of the most efficient </v>

354
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.513
<v Speaker 2>transistors in the known universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This neural network is you running the </v>

355
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:47.504
<v Speaker 2>operating system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know his life and no computer yet </v>

356
00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:50.414
<v Speaker 2>conceived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes close to it's awesome </v>

357
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:52.214
<v Speaker 2>capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forged over millions and millions of </v>

358
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.233
<v Speaker 2>years of life on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain is capable of storing nearly </v>

359
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 2>8,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>iphones worth of information.</v>

360
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.173
<v Speaker 2>Everything you are do love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel care for long for and aspire to is </v>

361
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:07.964
<v Speaker 2>enabled by an incredibly complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>invisible symphony of neurological </v>

362
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:12.800
<v Speaker 2>processes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elegant,</v>

363
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:14.600
<v Speaker 2>seamless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and blisteringly fast.</v>

364
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:19.601
<v Speaker 2>When scientists try to simulate just one</v>
<v Speaker 2>second of a human brains abilities,</v>

365
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.310
<v Speaker 2>it took supercomputers 40 minutes to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

366
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.000
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the brain is who we each are heir</v>

367
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:30.950
<v Speaker 2>to this amazing birthright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forged over millions of millions,</v>

368
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.150
<v Speaker 2>millions and millions of years of life </v>
<v Speaker 2>on earth.</v>

369
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.080
<v Speaker 2>And yet the modern world is fighting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>at every turn.</v>

370
00:17:36.081 --> 00:17:36.914
<v Speaker 2>You know from the toxic industrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>products that have saturated the food </v>

371
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:44.930
<v Speaker 2>supply to the dietary advice that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been given for decades to now.</v>

372
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:47.900
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the pendulum is swinging </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other direction and people are,</v>

373
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like a dietary free for </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

374
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

375
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.340
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's shift my dietary.</v>

376
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:54.603
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know that at the moment I'm in </v>

377
00:17:57.631 --> 00:17:59.850
<v Speaker 2>the middle of this sort of slow carb</v>

378
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 1>diet is high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no sugar,</v>

379
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 1>no carb diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually in about a,</v>

380
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:09.540
<v Speaker 1>as of this taping in about nine days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lost about three pounds.</v>

381
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually feel pretty good.</v>

382
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I have these brief moments where I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to punch random people.</v>

383
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm being a little meaner on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter that I go would be for real.</v>

384
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean like there's just like a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of mood stuff,</v>

385
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.333
<v Speaker 1>but my energy feels pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting that sort of crashed </v>

386
00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 1>from coffee that you might get at like </v>
<v Speaker 1>2:00.</v>

387
00:18:25.591 --> 00:18:29.130
<v Speaker 1>That then has people drinking all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of chemicals that after there 2:30</v>

388
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 1>feeling or whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I basically feel pretty good.</v>

389
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much just meat and fish and </v>
<v Speaker 1>veggies and a lot of butter.</v>

390
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:38.723
<v Speaker 1>And you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said to me right before we started </v>

391
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe the butter grass fed butter.</v>

392
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

393
00:18:43.241 --> 00:18:46.150
<v Speaker 2>grass fed butter is definitely good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

394
00:18:46.151 --> 00:18:46.984
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely trace nutrients in </v>

395
00:18:48.521 --> 00:18:49.600
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vitamin K two,</v>

396
00:18:49.601 --> 00:18:51.460
<v Speaker 2>which we talked about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cla,</v>

397
00:18:51.461 --> 00:18:55.000
<v Speaker 2>which is being studied as a potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer fighter and fat burner.</v>

398
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's uh,</v>

399
00:18:56.831 --> 00:18:57.664
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the hallmarks of a healthy food </v>

400
00:18:58.901 --> 00:18:59.734
<v Speaker 2>is nutrient density.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you take any concentrated fat </v>

401
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.180
<v Speaker 2>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil,</v>

402
00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:06.280
<v Speaker 2>they're not very nutrient dense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got a lot of calories,</v>

403
00:19:06.281 --> 00:19:10.120
<v Speaker 2>nine calories per gram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tablespoon of oil has a hundred and 40</v>

404
00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:12.220
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

405
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.380
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

406
00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:15.214
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of calories with very little </v>

407
00:19:16.181 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 2>nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

408
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on butter alone,</v>

409
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.653
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of evidence to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that butter improves fat burning or </v>

410
00:19:23.741 --> 00:19:25.480
<v Speaker 2>brain health or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

411
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to tell people that,</v>

412
00:19:27.251 --> 00:19:28.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming fat,</v>

413
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.670
<v Speaker 2>the high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low carb Diet,</v>

414
00:19:30.671 --> 00:19:33.430
<v Speaker 2>if you already have fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you need is a low carb.</v>

415
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body has the fat to burn.</v>

416
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:36.980
<v Speaker 2>So nobody's good.</v>

417
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.063
<v Speaker 1>Go to your fat probably in your stomach </v>
<v Speaker 1>area as opposed to what a lot of people </v>

418
00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:43.164
<v Speaker 1>are doing with these diets is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>loading up on fat to sort of get the </v>

419
00:19:44.881 --> 00:19:48.400
<v Speaker 1>bike going on fat and then the hope is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that then it to your.</v>

420
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.533
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's going to want to burn the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat that you're consuming before it </v>

421
00:19:51.081 --> 00:19:54.590
<v Speaker 2>burns the fat that you have around your </v>
<v Speaker 2>waist and the point of a diet like this,</v>

422
00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I would assume is to lose some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat around your,</v>

423
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:57.800
<v Speaker 2>around your waist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

424
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:58.663
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why I think this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation is so interesting because </v>

425
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.641
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:20:01.641 --> 00:20:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Ferris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Ferris,</v>

427
00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:05.630
<v Speaker 1>he's the one that sort of did this low </v>
<v Speaker 1>carb thing first or the four hour body,</v>

428
00:20:05.631 --> 00:20:07.460
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

429
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

430
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.520
<v Speaker 1>He's focusing on that part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight loss part.</v>

431
00:20:10.521 --> 00:20:12.240
<v Speaker 1>So I am seeing some results on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>

432
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.680
<v Speaker 1>You're focusing on the brain part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also very important to me.</v>

433
00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:16.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:16.983
<v Speaker 1>I'm someone that likes to know what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about and be able to have clean </v>

435
00:20:19.221 --> 00:20:19.980
<v Speaker 1>thoughts at all.</v>

436
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.813
<v Speaker 2>Of course I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I like to focus on the weight </v>

437
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.233
<v Speaker 2>part too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a concern for I think </v>

438
00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.243
<v Speaker 2>everybody and it's a good way also to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just have this conversation about </v>

439
00:20:27.921 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and healthy eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

440
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start a low carb diet,</v>

441
00:20:31.371 --> 00:20:32.204
<v Speaker 2>you're going to lose a lot of water </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight at first because what you're </v>

442
00:20:33.651 --> 00:20:37.160
<v Speaker 2>doing is you're depleting the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>glycogen stored in your muscles.</v>

443
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Glycogen is basically how your muscles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and liver stores sugar,</v>

444
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.770
<v Speaker 2>but for every gram of glycogen in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles store,</v>

445
00:20:42.771 --> 00:20:45.050
<v Speaker 2>you also store about three to four grams</v>
<v Speaker 2>of water.</v>

446
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.153
<v Speaker 2>So that's why once you start depleting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the glycogen from your muscles with </v>

447
00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:51.040
<v Speaker 2>vigorous exercise or just by not eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of carbs,</v>

448
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.250
<v Speaker 2>you lose a lot of water weight very </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

449
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.233
<v Speaker 2>And that's also why when people stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating low carb and go back to eating a </v>

450
00:20:58.061 --> 00:20:58.894
<v Speaker 2>higher carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their weight just shoots up because </v>

451
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:03.280
<v Speaker 2>their muscles end up storing all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>glycogen along with all that,</v>

452
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with four parts water for every one </v>

453
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 2>gram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one part of,</v>

454
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.540
<v Speaker 2>of sugar storage.</v>

455
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like in a month from now,</v>

456
00:21:09.931 --> 00:21:10.764
<v Speaker 1>if I can keep running with this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to have you and Ferris on </v>

457
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.430
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys can like poke me,</v>

458
00:21:14.431 --> 00:21:16.710
<v Speaker 1>you can poke my brain area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could poke my stomach,</v>

459
00:21:16.711 --> 00:21:17.990
<v Speaker 1>will figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds great.</v>

460
00:21:17.991 --> 00:21:18.870
<v Speaker 1>What happened here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

461
00:21:18.871 --> 00:21:21.660
<v Speaker 1>so enough about my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my diet people.</v>

462
00:21:21.661 --> 00:21:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I guess we'll see the results right here</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the youtube.</v>

463
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

464
00:21:25.531 --> 00:21:27.710
<v Speaker 1>So you start realizing that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

465
00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.770
<v Speaker 1>the medicine for dementia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's,</v>

466
00:21:31.771 --> 00:21:33.080
<v Speaker 1>these cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

467
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.490
<v Speaker 1>degenerative diseases is not quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

468
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.720
<v Speaker 1>You start changing your own diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also realized,</v>

469
00:21:38.721 --> 00:21:41.910
<v Speaker 1>well this is how I can also sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped my mom and help other people like</v>

470
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:42.763
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are some of the first things </v>

471
00:21:43.591 --> 00:21:44.424
<v Speaker 1>that you realized that do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we as people have generally are </v>

472
00:21:46.561 --> 00:21:47.220
<v Speaker 1>doing wrong?</v>

473
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well definitely,</v>

474
00:21:48.301 --> 00:21:51.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my diet used to be dictated by um,</v>

475
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sort of conventional wisdom was </v>

476
00:21:54.211 --> 00:21:57.030
<v Speaker 2>surrounding a healthy diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I used to build my base,</v>

477
00:21:57.031 --> 00:22:00.870
<v Speaker 2>my diet or on grains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to basically Shaun White carbs,</v>

478
00:22:00.871 --> 00:22:01.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white rice,</v>

479
00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:04.110
<v Speaker 2>white bread as if it were some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>toxin,</v>

480
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.020
<v Speaker 2>but if you put a huge bowl of brown rice</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of me,</v>

481
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:09.330
<v Speaker 2>I would go to town on it often asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>for seconds,</v>

482
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:10.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every meal had to include a grain and I </v>

483
00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:11.964
<v Speaker 2>would notice that my energy levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the day always felt like a </v>

484
00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:16.410
<v Speaker 2>rollercoaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

485
00:22:16.411 --> 00:22:17.244
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't really go many hours after </v>
<v Speaker 2>waking without eating something right </v>

486
00:22:20.221 --> 00:22:21.054
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in between lunch and dinner I was </v>

487
00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:24.270
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would often find myself starving.</v>

488
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.160
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

489
00:22:26.161 --> 00:22:27.600
<v Speaker 2>when I started looking into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>

490
00:22:27.601 --> 00:22:28.434
<v Speaker 2>I realized that there's really no good </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence to say that grains improve </v>

491
00:22:31.201 --> 00:22:31.530
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

492
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean certainly if you're metabolically</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>

493
00:22:33.211 --> 00:22:34.044
<v Speaker 2>you can tolerate grains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not the case for 50 percent of </v>

494
00:22:36.451 --> 00:22:40.200
<v Speaker 2>the people living in America that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>either pre diabetic or diabetic and have</v>

495
00:22:40.201 --> 00:22:43.590
<v Speaker 2>essentially become glucose or </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate intolerant.</v>

496
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.180
<v Speaker 2>If you're healthy though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can eat,</v>

497
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rice and you can certainly incorporated </v>

498
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.090
<v Speaker 2>as a means of improving a athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

499
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was really the first thing that</v>

500
00:22:53.851 --> 00:22:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

501
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.520
<v Speaker 2>because my dad was never very high in </v>
<v Speaker 2>added sugars.</v>

502
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.193
<v Speaker 2>I started cutting out the breads and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rices and all that stuff and the pastas </v>

503
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.830
<v Speaker 2>and I noticed that my energy levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

504
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only did they go through the roof,</v>

505
00:23:06.841 --> 00:23:08.280
<v Speaker 2>but there were more stable throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>

506
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

507
00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:14.220
<v Speaker 2>without even really trying my body </v>
<v Speaker 2>composition changed.</v>

508
00:23:14.221 --> 00:23:15.054
<v Speaker 2>I started losing fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that was just like a </v>

509
00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:19.680
<v Speaker 2>side bonus.</v>

510
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.410
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

511
00:23:22.411 --> 00:23:23.244
<v Speaker 2>the recommendations to eat grains </v>
<v Speaker 2>because many people do consider them </v>

512
00:23:26.131 --> 00:23:26.641
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

513
00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:28.890
<v Speaker 2>how could keen wire brown rice peanuts </v>
<v Speaker 2>but healthy,</v>

514
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come from misguided,</v>

515
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition policy over the past 50 years </v>

516
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.400
<v Speaker 2>that have really been attributed to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean dietary pattern.</v>

517
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.683
<v Speaker 2>That's this nebulous idea of how people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Mediterranean eat 'em because </v>

518
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:45.443
<v Speaker 2>epidemiological observational population</v>
<v Speaker 2>based research shows that they have </v>

519
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:52.850
<v Speaker 2>reduced rates of cardiovascular disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>and neurological disease.</v>

520
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:55.430
<v Speaker 2>But when you look at randomized control </v>
<v Speaker 2>trials,</v>

521
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 2>which are the kinds of trials required </v>
<v Speaker 2>to prove cause and effect,</v>

522
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 2>there is no good evidence to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>grains improve health.</v>

523
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:02.953
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at research controlled </v>

524
00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:09.131
<v Speaker 2>trials with people with prediabetes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>type two diabetes or obesity,</v>

525
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.393
<v Speaker 2>low carb diets seem to win most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time when compared to a standard low </v>

526
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:16.550
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

527
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:18.830
<v Speaker 2>conventional wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional dietary wisdom.</v>

528
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:19.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's back up for a second because </v>

529
00:24:21.041 --> 00:24:21.874
<v Speaker 1>you said something really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just sort of rolled off your </v>

530
00:24:23.471 --> 00:24:24.304
<v Speaker 1>tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems pretty freaking staggering and </v>

531
00:24:26.111 --> 00:24:26.944
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty percent of Americans are either </v>

532
00:24:28.991 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 1>pre diabetic or diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the latest statistics.</v>

533
00:24:32.511 --> 00:24:34.720
<v Speaker 1>So what is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is prediabetic actually mean?</v>

534
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.653
<v Speaker 2>So when you're pre diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood sugar is higher than it </v>

535
00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 2>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a doctor will measure.</v>

536
00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:41.360
<v Speaker 2>And they'll say you should probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

537
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.350
<v Speaker 2>change up your diet because you are at </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk for becoming a type two diabetic.</v>

538
00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:46.643
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like this middle ground </v>

539
00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:48.700
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

540
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:50.483
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood sugar is higher than it </v>

541
00:24:51.021 --> 00:24:51.390
<v Speaker 2>should be.</v>

542
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Do they know how much that number has </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed over the years?</v>

543
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I suspect since probably the fifties </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we started all this process,</v>

544
00:24:58.121 --> 00:25:00.810
<v Speaker 1>food and sugars and all that stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

545
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:01.733
<v Speaker 1>and soft drinks and everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must have tremendously increased </v>

546
00:25:04.561 --> 00:25:05.220
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

547
00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

548
00:25:06.031 --> 00:25:08.820
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's skyrocketed in tandem with,</v>

549
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the obesity rates in this country.</v>

550
00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.173
<v Speaker 2>Sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two thirds of people are either </v>

551
00:25:13.261 --> 00:25:14.870
<v Speaker 2>overweight or obese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

552
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.780
<v Speaker 2>and they've kind of risen in tandem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>one another.</v>

553
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.963
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the only thing that can really </v>

554
00:25:21.241 --> 00:25:23.850
<v Speaker 2>explain it is the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

555
00:25:23.851 --> 00:25:26.790
<v Speaker 2>because our genes certainly haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed over the past 100 years as a,</v>

556
00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.100
<v Speaker 2>as a population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what has.</v>

557
00:25:29.101 --> 00:25:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the food supply,</v>

558
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

559
00:25:32.251 --> 00:25:34.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of zealotry in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>of nutrition.</v>

560
00:25:34.441 --> 00:25:35.131
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

561
00:25:35.131 --> 00:25:37.440
<v Speaker 2>people tend to feel very religious of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other nutritious,</v>

562
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>

563
00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

564
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:45.690
<v Speaker 2>in general what I think most people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would agree on is that there is become a</v>

565
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:50.430
<v Speaker 2>ubiquity of hyper processed foods that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are rich in both readily,</v>

566
00:25:50.431 --> 00:25:53.850
<v Speaker 2>easily digestible carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulverized grains,</v>

567
00:25:53.851 --> 00:25:57.240
<v Speaker 2>stripped of their nutrients and added </v>
<v Speaker 2>fats.</v>

568
00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.890
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of these foods put together a,</v>

569
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.770
<v Speaker 2>basically create a stereotypical junk </v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

570
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what most people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming these days.</v>

571
00:26:08.431 --> 00:26:09.264
<v Speaker 2>I mean 60 percent of calories that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans consume come from these exact </v>

572
00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:13.710
<v Speaker 2>kinds of foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultra processed foods.</v>

573
00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.653
<v Speaker 1>I always think of that commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're still running </v>

574
00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:17.024
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's with a Larry the cable guy for </v>

575
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:19.814
<v Speaker 1>prior Lasek OTC and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's out there eating the hot dogs and </v>

576
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:25.440
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff and he's basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can eat whatever you want as long as</v>

577
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:30.290
<v Speaker 1>your private sec otc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like the pill is the answer,</v>

578
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:31.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a pretty heavy guy in the first </v>

579
00:26:32.271 --> 00:26:33.590
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem with him,</v>

580
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.663
<v Speaker 1>but it's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we go to do whatever the hell you </v>

581
00:26:36.891 --> 00:26:39.710
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then here's our magic pill for it.</v>

582
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best way to be dealing with are not.</v>

583
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the best way at all.</v>

584
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is,</v>

585
00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you've.</v>

586
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:51.530
<v Speaker 2>One of the main drivers of of type two </v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes and insulin resistance,</v>

587
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 2>which category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the sort of,</v>

588
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 2>which is the hallmark of type two </v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes,</v>

589
00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.253
<v Speaker 2>is chronically elevated levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin which could precede a diagnosis </v>

590
00:27:01.171 --> 00:27:02.004
<v Speaker 2>of prediabetes by a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean people are walking around </v>

591
00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 2>eating on average 300 grams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates per day.</v>

592
00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Exactly from the kinds of foods that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about,</v>

593
00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:11.514
<v Speaker 2>hyper processed foods and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a number on our metabolisms are </v>

594
00:27:14.521 --> 00:27:18.320
<v Speaker 2>waistlines and genius foods we explore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

595
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.270
<v Speaker 2>what it's doing to our brains and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental function and our moods.</v>

596
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really where I want to focus </v>

597
00:27:23.211 --> 00:27:24.044
<v Speaker 1>on this because I think that's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise and I just find that </v>

598
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:26.683
<v Speaker 1>fascinating because I think there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of things happening right now that </v>

599
00:27:28.731 --> 00:27:29.564
<v Speaker 1>might be changing some of our brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry and how we think and all that </v>

600
00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:33.584
<v Speaker 1>sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at any point when this was happening </v>

601
00:27:35.661 --> 00:27:36.494
<v Speaker 1>with your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did any doctor say maybe she should </v>

602
00:27:38.871 --> 00:27:40.400
<v Speaker 1>change her diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this or that?</v>

603
00:27:40.401 --> 00:27:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Or really</v>

604
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.053
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once,</v>

605
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.960
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to all of the most storied,</v>

606
00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:46.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>US news and whatever that the annual </v>

607
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.860
<v Speaker 2>ranking of hospitals in America is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were at,</v>

608
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.790
<v Speaker 2>we went to the top hospitals to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find a diagnosis and not once was,</v>

609
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet mentioned at all and you know,</v>

610
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.943
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not conclusive evidence on how </v>

611
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 2>diet can affect somebody who has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

612
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:07.920
<v Speaker 2>although it's starting to bubble up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

613
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.790
<v Speaker 2>in the literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

614
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:10.621
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

615
00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:11.454
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise wasn't really mentioned even </v>

616
00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:16.460
<v Speaker 2>though exercise is one of the best ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>to treat,</v>

617
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:17.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the actually,</v>

618
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

619
00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:20.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

620
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.833
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

621
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.750
<v Speaker 2>the guidelines for treating mild </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive impairment.</v>

622
00:28:24.751 --> 00:28:26.790
<v Speaker 2>We're literally just updated two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

623
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

624
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to include exercise as a means of </v>

625
00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:32.310
<v Speaker 2>treatment for people with mild cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>impairment,</v>

626
00:28:32.311 --> 00:28:33.144
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of like pre dementia which</v>
<v Speaker 2>often converts to diseases like </v>

627
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's disease.</v>

628
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:38.940
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I became,</v>

629
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I became fixated on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on these sort of alternate approaches to</v>

630
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.410
<v Speaker 2>treatment and even possibly prevention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

631
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.083
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

632
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:48.953
<v Speaker 2>when I had that experience with my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've always been a big believer </v>

633
00:28:50.821 --> 00:28:51.654
<v Speaker 2>in the power of Diet and lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just seen it play out in my own </v>

634
00:28:53.611 --> 00:28:54.444
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I go to the gym and I'm a </v>

635
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:59.240
<v Speaker 2>different person walking out of the gym </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I am walking into the gym.</v>

636
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean whatever cobwebs I have in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>head are gone,</v>

637
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excised like the demons,</v>

638
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are excised with a good workout.</v>

639
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.260
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

640
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 2>that's not something that I feel like is</v>
<v Speaker 2>common wisdom.</v>

641
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:13.703
<v Speaker 2>So when this all happened to my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started researching and I realized </v>

642
00:29:17.431 --> 00:29:18.420
<v Speaker 2>that there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

643
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:23.490
<v Speaker 2>insight out there both in terms of risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors for developing dementia.</v>

644
00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

645
00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:26.184
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the Mediterranean dietary pattern </v>

646
00:29:27.151 --> 00:29:27.984
<v Speaker 2>which we talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is associated with reduced risks </v>

647
00:29:29.971 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 2>of many chronic diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

648
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Can you explain to people what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

649
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.810
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of oils.</v>

650
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's characterized by being really </v>

651
00:29:36.731 --> 00:29:38.950
<v Speaker 2>high and extra virgin olive oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

652
00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.390
<v Speaker 2>a glass of wine per day for women wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

653
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.780
<v Speaker 2>for men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

654
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:44.614
<v Speaker 2>and then the way that it's typically </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined in the medical literature is as </v>

655
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:47.940
<v Speaker 2>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

656
00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 2>it's defined as being a grain based </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

657
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.050
<v Speaker 2>And it all stems back from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

658
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 2>this one epidemiologist named Ancil keys</v>
<v Speaker 2>who basically,</v>

659
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.033
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 fifties stationed himself on </v>

660
00:29:58.871 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 2>the island of Crete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

661
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.533
<v Speaker 2>to look at how that population basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>ate and went about their lives in the </v>

662
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Speaker 2>midst of a major epidemic of heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease in the United States.</v>

663
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:10.114
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to see what they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently in the Mediterranean region </v>

664
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:15.340
<v Speaker 2>of the world that we might be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>glean some nutritional insight.</v>

665
00:30:15.341 --> 00:30:18.520
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a story that's been told by,</v>

666
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

667
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.103
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great book called the big fat </v>

668
00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:22.150
<v Speaker 2>surprise with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

669
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.210
<v Speaker 2>the journalist who wrote it really goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into depth on the story.</v>

670
00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:28.300
<v Speaker 2>But I talk about it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Genius Foods.</v>

671
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

672
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.990
<v Speaker 2>he was stationed on the island during </v>
<v Speaker 2>lent.</v>

673
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:32.883
<v Speaker 2>So it was a particularly lean time just </v>
<v Speaker 2>after World War II and his observation </v>

674
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 2>of their dietary pattern was one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

675
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:41.930
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was predominantly grain based,</v>

676
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people in the Mediterranean region,</v>

677
00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 2>they love fatty cuts of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

678
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:46.234
<v Speaker 2>I have friends who were born there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>who visit very frequently and they eat </v>

679
00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:52.000
<v Speaker 2>very fatty cuts of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lamb,</v>

680
00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:52.834
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

681
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:53.913
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all but ignored in the medical </v>

682
00:30:55.841 --> 00:30:56.674
<v Speaker 2>textbook definition of the Mediterranean</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet and also when you're observing the </v>

683
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:04.810
<v Speaker 2>population as well as what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're eating,</v>

684
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.303
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to ascribe causality to </v>
<v Speaker 2>any dietary element because what you're </v>

685
00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:12.460
<v Speaker 2>observing is basically you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing just that.</v>

686
00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:13.294
<v Speaker 2>You're observing variables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but without doing a randomized control </v>

687
00:31:16.491 --> 00:31:17.324
<v Speaker 2>trial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to prove which aspects </v>

688
00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:22.000
<v Speaker 2>of that diet are causally related to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

689
00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the phenotypes,</v>

690
00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:25.750
<v Speaker 2>the outcomes that you're seeing in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the population health.</v>

691
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

692
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.053
<v Speaker 1>so that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that could partly also just because </v>

693
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:33.670
<v Speaker 1>of geography and lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the amount they move around,</v>

694
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.860
<v Speaker 1>if it's cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might need a little more fat on your</v>

695
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:36.780
<v Speaker 1>bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

696
00:31:36.781 --> 00:31:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

697
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:37.783
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need a randomized controlled </v>

698
00:31:38.541 --> 00:31:39.440
<v Speaker 2>trial to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I,</v>

699
00:31:39.441 --> 00:31:41.420
<v Speaker 2>what I argue in the book is that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:31:41.421 --> 00:31:42.254
<v Speaker 2>what you see in terms of the health of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people living in that region of the </v>

701
00:31:44.991 --> 00:31:48.080
<v Speaker 2>world is not because of the grains that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're eating,</v>

702
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.910
<v Speaker 2>but in spite of the Greens that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading.</v>

703
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Because when you actually look at what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greens are,</v>

704
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole lot of starch wrapped in a </v>

705
00:31:56.181 --> 00:31:59.900
<v Speaker 2>little bit of insoluble fiber in a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of vitamins.</v>

706
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when building a healthy diet,</v>

707
00:32:03.861 --> 00:32:07.130
<v Speaker 2>we want to really look for things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are nutrient dense that the brain needs.</v>

708
00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.413
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

709
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:13.130
<v Speaker 2>one of the recommendations that I make </v>
<v Speaker 2>to people generally is to consume a huge</v>

710
00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:17.780
<v Speaker 2>salad of fatty salad every single day </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than eating a bowl of brown rice,</v>

711
00:32:17.781 --> 00:32:18.614
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty nutritionally sparse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dark leafy Greens contain a bevy of </v>

712
00:32:22.731 --> 00:32:25.250
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients that the brain actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to create energy.</v>

713
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.140
<v Speaker 2>And there's really good research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

714
00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:28.043
<v Speaker 2>a study was just published from rush </v>
<v Speaker 2>university that found that people that </v>

715
00:32:31.191 --> 00:32:32.024
<v Speaker 2>consume a large bowl of dark leafy </v>
<v Speaker 2>greens per day have brains that look on </v>

716
00:32:35.121 --> 00:32:37.030
<v Speaker 2>scans 11 years younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

717
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so mean there's um,</v>

718
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.943
<v Speaker 1>and you also realized with some of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you're not missing much </v>

719
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.313
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even just in this week and </v>

720
00:32:46.021 --> 00:32:46.854
<v Speaker 1>whatever that I'm doing this diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to poke a bull yesterday and I </v>

721
00:32:49.381 --> 00:32:53.200
<v Speaker 1>usually get brown rice on the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got the leafy Greens instead and I</v>

722
00:32:53.201 --> 00:32:54.034
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way I enjoyed it more and I felt </v>

723
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:59.680
<v Speaker 1>kinda slimmer after because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just taking it all that right?</v>

724
00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 2>We're going to feel much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your body,</v>

725
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:02.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a lot of effort to keep certain </v>

726
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:07.160
<v Speaker 2>things within a very narrow margin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

727
00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.003
<v Speaker 2>your body temperature is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that your body works really hard </v>

728
00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 2>to keep hovering at around 98 point six </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees,</v>

729
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:15.194
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing with your blood sugar at </v>

730
00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:17.600
<v Speaker 2>any given time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got,</v>

731
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:18.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one teaspoon of circulating sugar in </v>

732
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:21.374
<v Speaker 2>your body and your pancreas works very </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to keep your circulating blood </v>

733
00:33:25.161 --> 00:33:25.994
<v Speaker 2>sugar at that level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The minute you eat a massive bowl of </v>

734
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:30.980
<v Speaker 2>brown rice or drink a glass of orange </v>
<v Speaker 2>juice,</v>

735
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:32.540
<v Speaker 2>which so many Americans begin their day </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

736
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.510
<v Speaker 2>which contains about six to seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaspoons of pure sugar.</v>

737
00:33:35.511 --> 00:33:36.344
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a delusion of glucose being </v>

738
00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:42.020
<v Speaker 2>shuttled straight into your blood that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of people don't need.</v>

739
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Whereas that sugar going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely it's going to end up on your</v>

740
00:33:45.411 --> 00:33:46.520
<v Speaker 2>hips and your waist.</v>

741
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically soft drinks.</v>

742
00:33:48.511 --> 00:33:49.344
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think everyone sort of knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>this at this point in drinks it despite </v>

743
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.430
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge or at least the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

744
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:54.283
<v Speaker 1>is readily accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So afterwards are pretty much the worst </v>

745
00:33:56.731 --> 00:33:57.690
<v Speaker 1>thing you can drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

746
00:33:57.691 --> 00:33:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean the amount of sugar there is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

747
00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the.</v>

748
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:06.550
<v Speaker 2>There's no requirement for consuming a </v>
<v Speaker 2>added sugar.</v>

749
00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.073
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people actually feel that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>need sugar to fuel their brain because </v>

750
00:34:12.941 --> 00:34:13.774
<v Speaker 2>of the boost and executive function that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel after consuming a food that's </v>

751
00:34:19.181 --> 00:34:22.960
<v Speaker 2>sugary or a granola bar or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any carb rich food,</v>

752
00:34:22.961 --> 00:34:27.520
<v Speaker 2>but really so many people are hooked on </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose as a fuel for the brain.</v>

753
00:34:27.521 --> 00:34:28.354
<v Speaker 2>That in reality what they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're treating their withdrawal from </v>

754
00:34:30.521 --> 00:34:33.490
<v Speaker 2>sugar from the previous meal and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>why they feel boost.</v>

755
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.770
<v Speaker 1>So basically you have the soda at lunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you,</v>

756
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.320
<v Speaker 1>you're having that crash like two hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>later and you're like,</v>

757
00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:41.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need that bar.</v>

758
00:34:41.001 --> 00:34:41.490
<v Speaker 1>That has.</v>

759
00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

760
00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:44.430
<v Speaker 2>And it tricks you have tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's,</v>

761
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.653
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a good reason that you feel </v>

762
00:34:46.381 --> 00:34:49.890
<v Speaker 2>tricked and that you feel like these </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods are your friends because you know,</v>

763
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:53.310
<v Speaker 2>when you're on that sort of glucose </v>
<v Speaker 2>roller coaster throughout the day,</v>

764
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.040
<v Speaker 2>you need those constant pick me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the problem.</v>

765
00:34:56.041 --> 00:34:56.874
<v Speaker 2>So what I think you know is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a more sustainable way of having </v>

766
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.693
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cognitive resilience is to step off of </v>

767
00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:07.710
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that train the glucose train,</v>

768
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:08.993
<v Speaker 2>and really reacquaint yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy fats and foods that are much </v>

769
00:35:11.941 --> 00:35:12.774
<v Speaker 2>lower in carbohydrates and much richer </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the nutrients that your brain </v>

770
00:35:15.661 --> 00:35:16.420
<v Speaker 2>actually needs.</v>

771
00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.253
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get down to all the things we </v>

772
00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:22.610
<v Speaker 1>should be eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about green leafy things,</v>

773
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.900
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot more to it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a lot of this is about.</v>

774
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:28.910
<v Speaker 1>So let's get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to.</v>

775
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Someone's watching this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're eating poorly.</v>

776
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:33.763
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're eating okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they think they're doing a pretty </v>

777
00:35:35.181 --> 00:35:38.430
<v Speaker 1>good job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they want to just kind of reset.</v>

778
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Take them from one.</v>

779
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

780
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.373
<v Speaker 2>I think the first thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do is really cut out the </v>

781
00:35:44.091 --> 00:35:46.640
<v Speaker 2>processed foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is harder than it seems.</v>

782
00:35:46.641 --> 00:35:47.261
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

783
00:35:47.261 --> 00:35:48.094
<v Speaker 2>and I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my heart goes out to people that feel </v>

784
00:35:49.671 --> 00:35:52.100
<v Speaker 2>like they can't give up the junk food </v>
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>

785
00:35:52.101 --> 00:35:52.934
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these foods are not designed to be </v>

786
00:35:53.931 --> 00:35:54.764
<v Speaker 2>consumed in moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The advice to eat everything in </v>

787
00:35:56.211 --> 00:35:59.120
<v Speaker 2>moderation is horrible in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

788
00:35:59.121 --> 00:35:59.954
<v Speaker 2>in the modern supermarket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally our supermarket aisles or are </v>

789
00:36:03.141 --> 00:36:06.890
<v Speaker 2>lined with foods that are designed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists that are paid a lot more than</v>

790
00:36:06.891 --> 00:36:10.970
<v Speaker 2>you and I to to create insatiable </v>
<v Speaker 2>overconsumption and addiction.</v>

791
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:11.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

792
00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:13.500
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's focus on that for a second because</v>

793
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.560
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually true.</v>

794
00:36:16.561 --> 00:36:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Like they actually have people working </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

795
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Isn't this what they did with Doritos </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally?</v>

796
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

797
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.963
<v Speaker 1>I think that they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that cool ranch flavor I usually </v>

798
00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:26.214
<v Speaker 1>just to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally used to just lick those </v>

799
00:36:28.231 --> 00:36:29.760
<v Speaker 1>chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to hear your fingers.</v>

800
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

801
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.433
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are literally scientists </v>

802
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:37.730
<v Speaker 1>working for these companies making you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want more and more and more.</v>

803
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These foods which now make up against 60</v>

804
00:36:41.251 --> 00:36:42.084
<v Speaker 2>percent of the calories consumed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>US are designed to screw up your brain </v>

805
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.940
<v Speaker 2>and usually what happens is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist will combine some parts,</v>

806
00:36:47.941 --> 00:36:48.930
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheat,</v>

807
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:49.823
<v Speaker 2>usually with fat and salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it creates this unique mixture of </v>

808
00:36:54.181 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 2>delectable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

809
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.240
<v Speaker 2>mouth feel as well as just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

810
00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.083
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

811
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:04.050
<v Speaker 2>the exact sensation that we've evolved </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically to seek out more of.</v>

812
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.720
<v Speaker 2>It just sets off dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fireworks and our brain.</v>

813
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:07.723
<v Speaker 1>Is that actually the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to your brand when you do drugs </v>

814
00:37:10.791 --> 00:37:11.990
<v Speaker 1>and then you need more drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

815
00:37:11.991 --> 00:37:14.410
<v Speaker 1>is it really the same chemical reactions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your head?</v>

816
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

817
00:37:15.681 --> 00:37:17.910
<v Speaker 2>If not worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've done studies on,</v>

818
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.410
<v Speaker 2>on animals rats for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

819
00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.253
<v Speaker 2>which are all ID basically in rats </v>
<v Speaker 2>provide a really great look into the </v>

820
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:27.830
<v Speaker 2>behavior that certain foods drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

821
00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:28.664
<v Speaker 2>they've got no super ego to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to steer them from what it is that they </v>

822
00:37:31.581 --> 00:37:32.414
<v Speaker 2>really want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've shown that rats actually </v>

823
00:37:34.491 --> 00:37:35.324
<v Speaker 2>prefer sugar to cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is funny because I was really </v>

824
00:37:37.101 --> 00:37:37.934
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

825
00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:39.920
<v Speaker 2>rats really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

826
00:37:39.921 --> 00:37:40.754
<v Speaker 2>And they really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

827
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

828
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:43.873
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we tend to think of ourselves as </v>

829
00:37:45.831 --> 00:37:47.690
<v Speaker 2>having had like a moral failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

830
00:37:47.691 --> 00:37:48.524
<v Speaker 2>Like when we go through a whole bag of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chips or like eat the whole pint of ice </v>

831
00:37:51.021 --> 00:37:51.980
<v Speaker 2>cream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

832
00:37:51.981 --> 00:37:54.890
<v Speaker 2>like these foods are not designed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumed in moderation.</v>

833
00:37:54.891 --> 00:37:59.630
<v Speaker 2>They're designed literally to have you </v>
<v Speaker 2>finish that whole pint or that whole bag</v>

834
00:37:59.631 --> 00:38:01.160
<v Speaker 2>and then go back as a repeat customer.</v>

835
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think the branding of it.</v>

836
00:38:02.641 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see all these things like guilt free</v>

837
00:38:05.461 --> 00:38:10.320
<v Speaker 1>chips or don't feel bad about how fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are already at this stuff.</v>

838
00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's like it's all this weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological play to,</v>

839
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.910
<v Speaker 1>to get you to keep eating all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

840
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:15.853
<v Speaker 2>Once you pop you can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a truism with scientific </v>

841
00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:18.681
<v Speaker 2>backing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

842
00:38:18.681 --> 00:38:19.330
<v Speaker 2>At this point.</v>

843
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.740
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the reset person that's watching this</v>

844
00:38:21.741 --> 00:38:23.190
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to start doing some stuff.</v>

845
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:24.063
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the process stuff out and that </v>

846
00:38:24.981 --> 00:38:25.814
<v Speaker 1>includes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

847
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.430
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much all the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see in the frozen section.</v>

848
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:29.563
<v Speaker 1>Like all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all of that frozen breakfast stuff </v>

849
00:38:31.881 --> 00:38:33.800
<v Speaker 1>and all of those sandwiches and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

850
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

851
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 2>and actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

852
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:37.204
<v Speaker 2>a really good recommendation for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are really trying to make this </v>

853
00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:42.700
<v Speaker 2>change is to first actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of counterintuitive,</v>

854
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 2>but to work on your sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleep,</v>

855
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allows a person to getting good quality,</v>

856
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:51.100
<v Speaker 2>adequate sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives a person the hormonal fortitude to</v>

857
00:38:51.101 --> 00:38:53.640
<v Speaker 2>make those dietary changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>

858
00:38:53.641 --> 00:38:55.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're under slept,</v>

859
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 2>actually study was just put out showing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people tend to over consume and eat</v>

860
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.580
<v Speaker 2>excess calories predominantly from these</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact kinds of foods.</v>

861
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.910
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimizing sleep and then</v>

862
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 1>what do they say on sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how is it eight hours really?</v>

863
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they wanted for like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>average?</v>

864
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight hours is a good amount and that's </v>

865
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 2>also roughly the amount of sleep that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to maximize growth hormone,</v>

866
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.653
<v Speaker 2>which is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an important hormone in the body for </v>

867
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 2>preserving lean mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

868
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.760
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

869
00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:25.643
<v Speaker 2>and quality sleep as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean not just getting those eight </v>

870
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:28.234
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but making sure that those eight hours </v>

871
00:39:28.901 --> 00:39:33.901
<v Speaker 2>are really super high quality and we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into ways of optimizing sleep.</v>

872
00:39:34.571 --> 00:39:35.404
<v Speaker 2>I guess one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best ways that I like to </v>

873
00:39:36.281 --> 00:39:37.114
<v Speaker 2>optimize my sleep and I find it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very effective is to limit my exposure </v>

874
00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:43.630
<v Speaker 2>to screens at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

875
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.050
<v Speaker 2>because what time do you shut down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shut down.</v>

876
00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I try to shut down two to three hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>before bed or if I,</v>

877
00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:54.310
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not shutting down and I have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work up until the point at which,</v>

878
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:54.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to bed.</v>

879
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:56.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in the real world,</v>

880
00:39:56.651 --> 00:39:57.484
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes we have to respond to an </v>

881
00:39:59.021 --> 00:40:03.220
<v Speaker 2>urgent email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use blue light blocking glasses,</v>

882
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.193
<v Speaker 2>which I'm a big fan of actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's good research on amber </v>

883
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:07.714
<v Speaker 2>colored glasses and their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of mitigate some of the loss of </v>

884
00:40:11.621 --> 00:40:12.454
<v Speaker 2>Melatonin.</v>

885
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.373
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the same effect that the iphone </v>

886
00:40:15.301 --> 00:40:17.580
<v Speaker 1>has now with their night thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

887
00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.070
<v Speaker 1>that same thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure</v>

888
00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.700
<v Speaker 2>filter on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

889
00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it's comparable </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

890
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.073
<v Speaker 2>It feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it certainly feels way better to my </v>

891
00:40:26.551 --> 00:40:27.900
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

892
00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.430
<v Speaker 2>when night shift is on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

893
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.300
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I noticed that when I,</v>

894
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.090
<v Speaker 2>so in my house in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a,</v>

895
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:37.710
<v Speaker 2>it's my brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live with my brother.</v>

896
00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.113
<v Speaker 2>He has a massive TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 85 inches or just one of the </v>

897
00:40:41.701 --> 00:40:45.480
<v Speaker 2>biggest monster is in television I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen in my life and you know,</v>

898
00:40:45.481 --> 00:40:46.314
<v Speaker 2>he likes to watch movies up until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point at which she goes to bed and </v>

899
00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.940
<v Speaker 2>that's not my preference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

900
00:40:50.941 --> 00:40:51.774
<v Speaker 2>I do that with him sometimes and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch like a movie up until like </v>

901
00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:58.980
<v Speaker 2>midnight or something and I notice that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I have that amount of light pouring</v>

902
00:40:58.981 --> 00:41:01.410
<v Speaker 2>into my face when I go to bed right </v>
<v Speaker 2>after that,</v>

903
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll oftentimes actually wake up feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>hung over even though I've never,</v>

904
00:41:05.281 --> 00:41:07.770
<v Speaker 2>I've had the eight hours of sleep and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't had any alcohol.</v>

905
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I just feel under slept and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>rejuvenated.</v>

906
00:41:11.221 --> 00:41:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when I wear the blue light </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocking glasses and I have no,</v>

907
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:17.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a,</v>

908
00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:18.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>formally affiliated with any of these </v>

909
00:41:19.501 --> 00:41:21.540
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't manufacture them in any sense.</v>

910
00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:23.220
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do find that they work.</v>

911
00:41:23.221 --> 00:41:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wake up feeling a lot more refreshed.</v>

912
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

913
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.983
<v Speaker 1>I think that the digital piece of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so interesting because I talk about </v>

914
00:41:29.631 --> 00:41:30.464
<v Speaker 1>it with almost every guest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the frustration with social media </v>

915
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.700
<v Speaker 1>and not putting this stuff down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>digital addiction and,</v>

916
00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.713
<v Speaker 1>and all of this and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've tried to do </v>

917
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:39.194
<v Speaker 1>is I never bring my phone into my room </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore bedroom where I just stopped </v>

918
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 1>doing it because I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

919
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.413
<v Speaker 1>right before I go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at my phone and then </v>

920
00:41:45.621 --> 00:41:47.750
<v Speaker 1>literally the first thing I do when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up,</v>

921
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.540
<v Speaker 1>before I brush my teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I go to the bathroom,</v>

922
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm suddenly looking at my phone again.</v>

923
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Like even if it's all wonderful news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not an,</v>

924
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.850
<v Speaker 1>it's usually not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if it was,</v>

925
00:41:58.851 --> 00:42:00.710
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not a great way to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that.</v>

926
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:01.544
<v Speaker 1>And I've really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really been trying to do no technology </v>

927
00:42:03.351 --> 00:42:06.590
<v Speaker 1>on the weekends and I think and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's really helped.</v>

928
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.030
<v Speaker 1>So is there some sort of connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>between all of that and,</v>

929
00:42:10.031 --> 00:42:14.900
<v Speaker 1>and like just the digital monster that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>affecting our brain to.</v>

930
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no yelling,</v>

931
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:17.980
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

932
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.150
<v Speaker 1>like something else happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

933
00:42:19.151 --> 00:42:21.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think from a mood standpoint,</v>

934
00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:22.600
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like you know,</v>

935
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.473
<v Speaker 1>our stress response evolved at a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when things that were stressful to us </v>

936
00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:31.031
<v Speaker 1>required our immediate attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a bear in your face like this,</v>

937
00:42:32.041 --> 00:42:32.874
<v Speaker 1>like protracted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm psychological stress that so </v>

938
00:42:35.361 --> 00:42:36.430
<v Speaker 1>many of us have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

939
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.333
<v Speaker 1>so commonly today is a fairly new </v>
<v Speaker 1>invention and on the evolutionary </v>

940
00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:42.950
<v Speaker 1>timescale and the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

941
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:45.770
<v Speaker 1>knows this and app developers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>APP developers know this.</v>

942
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:49.610
<v Speaker 1>That's why like you turn on any news </v>
<v Speaker 1>station,</v>

943
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.240
<v Speaker 1>local news especially they abide by the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it bleeds,</v>

944
00:42:53.241 --> 00:42:54.074
<v Speaker 1>it leads mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the most anxiety inducing segment </v>

945
00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:58.183
<v Speaker 1>upfront or tease at it at least so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it causes an expression of a or an </v>

946
00:43:02.361 --> 00:43:04.460
<v Speaker 1>upregulation of norepinephrine in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

947
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:05.294
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the brain's focus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention neurotransmitter associated </v>

948
00:43:07.971 --> 00:43:08.804
<v Speaker 1>with stress.</v>

949
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that you know in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

950
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:14.450
<v Speaker 1>it makes you more alert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel more awake.</v>

951
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.880
<v Speaker 1>And so when you read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

952
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:18.900
<v Speaker 1>doom and gloom news on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your smartphone,</v>

953
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you're basically having the same exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress response.</v>

954
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:22.633
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how when you step away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>it a little bit to how silly it almost </v>

955
00:43:25.491 --> 00:43:26.324
<v Speaker 1>seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when I get away on the weekend </v>

956
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:28.723
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm back on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look back at anything that might </v>

957
00:43:30.781 --> 00:43:32.150
<v Speaker 1>have happened and I see all these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

958
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

959
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.840
<v Speaker 1>you all spent your weekend fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this stuff.</v>

960
00:43:35.841 --> 00:43:38.720
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing that we're doing it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weekdays and maybe we can all manage</v>

961
00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:39.554
<v Speaker 1>that myself included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can all manage that a little </v>

962
00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:42.044
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that endless sort of no way out </v>

963
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:47.621
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

964
00:43:47.621 --> 00:43:49.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also.</v>

965
00:43:49.311 --> 00:43:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not as familiar with the.</v>

966
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:52.003
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a study that came out showing </v>

967
00:43:54.411 --> 00:43:55.244
<v Speaker 1>that just having your smart phone around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you is exhausting from a cognitive </v>

968
00:43:58.761 --> 00:44:01.160
<v Speaker 1>standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

969
00:44:01.161 --> 00:44:03.950
<v Speaker 1>just having it around and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that poll.</v>

970
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.113
<v Speaker 1>We get addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sort of hijacks our dopamine </v>

971
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:09.360
<v Speaker 1>systems as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

972
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.420
<v Speaker 1>being addicted to social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real thing.</v>

973
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:12.523
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to me though because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people watch this show and we know what </v>

974
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:18.530
<v Speaker 1>our watch times are and they're off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>charts for for Youtube,</v>

975
00:44:18.531 --> 00:44:19.364
<v Speaker 1>which usually has like a seven second </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch anime or something and that shows </v>

976
00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:22.844
<v Speaker 1>to me that people want long form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually want something that is in </v>

977
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.000
<v Speaker 1>so insulting to their senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their brain.</v>

978
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:29.893
<v Speaker 1>Now ironically many people are watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>this right now or listening on their </v>

979
00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:33.114
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people listen on their </v>

980
00:44:34.201 --> 00:44:36.590
<v Speaker 1>phones while they're doing exercise or </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're commuting or something,</v>

981
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.270
<v Speaker 1>but I do sense that people want </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>

982
00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:42.240
<v Speaker 1>so it's like the news is giving us the </v>
<v Speaker 1>local news as you're saying,</v>

983
00:44:42.241 --> 00:44:43.074
<v Speaker 1>they're giving us something we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want because they know they'll keep us </v>

984
00:44:44.881 --> 00:44:45.714
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but food companies are giving us </v>

985
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:49.440
<v Speaker 1>something that's not good for us because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know it'll keep us there.</v>

986
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.393
<v Speaker 1>We now know Tristan Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I've had on talked about how the </v>

987
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.200
<v Speaker 1>tech companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just alluded to this,</v>

988
00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:58.020
<v Speaker 1>are giving us things that they know are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad for us,</v>

989
00:44:58.021 --> 00:45:02.460
<v Speaker 1>so it really is your job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a full time job now as a human</v>

990
00:45:02.461 --> 00:45:05.310
<v Speaker 1>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do the things that actually</v>

991
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:06.810
<v Speaker 1>argued for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the things you keep</v>

992
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:07.500
<v Speaker 2>feeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

993
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.333
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think it's such a shame </v>

994
00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:15.420
<v Speaker 2>because we each are heir to this amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>gift,</v>

995
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:16.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human brain.</v>

996
00:45:16.351 --> 00:45:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Yet the modern world is like the hunger </v>
<v Speaker 2>games,</v>

997
00:45:18.061 --> 00:45:18.894
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like attacking it from every which way </v>

998
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.660
<v Speaker 2>and we are not equipped with the tools </v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand,</v>

999
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:26.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do to sort of fix that </v>

1000
00:45:28.441 --> 00:45:31.090
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

1001
00:45:31.091 --> 00:45:31.924
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely recommend people taking a </v>

1002
00:45:32.641 --> 00:45:36.330
<v Speaker 2>break from social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from news.</v>

1003
00:45:36.331 --> 00:45:39.360
<v Speaker 2>The 24 hour news cycle I think is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>not healthy.</v>

1004
00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also certainly food.</v>

1005
00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I think food is a major part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lifestyle,</v>

1006
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I talked about in</v>

1007
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:48.480
<v Speaker 2>the book we go into depth is the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1008
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:49.483
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only are we more sedentary than </v>

1009
00:45:50.701 --> 00:45:53.670
<v Speaker 2>we've ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not getting enough exercise a boat,</v>

1010
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:54.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1011
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:55.194
<v Speaker 2>there was another form of exercise that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we all had for the majority of our </v>

1012
00:45:58.081 --> 00:46:00.390
<v Speaker 2>evolution and that is thermal exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1013
00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:02.060
<v Speaker 2>today we live in a time where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1014
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:04.590
<v Speaker 2>there's chronic climate control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1015
00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that seems to be to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the detriment of our metabolisms.</v>

1016
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.850
<v Speaker 2>So I talk about how you can use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1017
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.480
<v Speaker 2>cold showers to enhance vigilance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1018
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:17.160
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the few things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do that you actually feel a shift in</v>

1019
00:46:17.161 --> 00:46:17.994
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness.</v>

1020
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Are you big on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are these people that like,</v>

1021
00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:23.310
<v Speaker 1>jumped from like the hot tub to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezing cold.</v>

1022
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was you that I've heard it.</v>

1023
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:26.913
<v Speaker 1>So I knew what you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took a picture like in a pool or </v>

1024
00:46:28.531 --> 00:46:29.364
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it must have been used I think the </v>

1025
00:46:30.511 --> 00:46:31.920
<v Speaker 1>first time I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is that?</v>

1026
00:46:31.921 --> 00:46:32.754
<v Speaker 1>So you're jumping from hot water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cold water in your system is just </v>

1027
00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:36.030
<v Speaker 1>like constantly rebooting.</v>

1028
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's good.</v>

1029
00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.080
<v Speaker 2>It's called contrast therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically,</v>

1030
00:46:39.081 --> 00:46:39.914
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're.</v>

1031
00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.150
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of the mechanisms are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conserved between the two activities.</v>

1032
00:46:44.151 --> 00:46:46.010
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go into a cold,</v>

1033
00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.620
<v Speaker 2>when you go into like a sauna for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1034
00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.110
<v Speaker 2>you're activating something called heat </v>
<v Speaker 2>shock proteins,</v>

1035
00:46:51.111 --> 00:46:51.944
<v Speaker 2>which are there to sort of guard the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proteins in your body against a </v>

1036
00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:55.544
<v Speaker 2>disfigurement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really important because a lot </v>

1037
00:46:56.691 --> 00:46:57.830
<v Speaker 2>of the diseases that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1038
00:46:57.831 --> 00:46:58.664
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parkinson's disease are associated with </v>

1039
00:47:00.861 --> 00:47:03.890
<v Speaker 2>misfolded proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anytime we can sort of activate these</v>

1040
00:47:03.891 --> 00:47:06.810
<v Speaker 2>heat shock proteins seems to be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1041
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.430
<v Speaker 2>there are also activated when you expose</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself to cold air.</v>

1042
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1043
00:47:12.471 --> 00:47:14.060
<v Speaker 2>there's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's really good research.</v>

1044
00:47:14.061 --> 00:47:14.894
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people now are practicing cryo </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy as a means of enhancing </v>

1045
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.270
<v Speaker 2>vigilance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reducing inflammation,</v>

1046
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.133
<v Speaker 2>boosting metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing the proliferation of Brown </v>

1047
00:47:23.661 --> 00:47:26.180
<v Speaker 2>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all have a kind of fat in asset.</v>

1048
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:29.750
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't thought that adults carried it</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them past a,</v>

1049
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a childhood or infancy.</v>

1050
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:33.820
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1051
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.880
<v Speaker 2>now we know that we actually have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of fat that's actually a good fat,</v>

1052
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:37.714
<v Speaker 2>the fat that we want more of because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's metabolically active and it burns </v>

1053
00:47:40.091 --> 00:47:42.110
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by going into cold and,</v>

1054
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.460
<v Speaker 2>and are keeping ourselves exposed to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1055
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.533
<v Speaker 2>intermittent cooler temperatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we actually encourage the proliferation </v>

1056
00:47:50.591 --> 00:47:51.610
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really cool.</v>

1057
00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.790
<v Speaker 1>So I thought by moving to La and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>an 80 degrees everyday,</v>

1058
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.040
<v Speaker 1>it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was good thing.</v>

1059
00:47:56.190 --> 00:48:00.300
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's good for my vitamin D but </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some of this other stuff.</v>

1060
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:48:01.201 --> 00:48:02.790
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think getting back to that,</v>

1062
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:03.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a little bit more thermal </v>

1063
00:48:05.881 --> 00:48:06.714
<v Speaker 2>stress in our lives is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've done really good research on </v>

1064
00:48:08.671 --> 00:48:10.620
<v Speaker 2>people with type two diabetes and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>found that,</v>

1065
00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even mild cold below or higher,</v>

1066
00:48:13.861 --> 00:48:16.950
<v Speaker 2>I should say then then what would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a freezing temperature,</v>

1067
00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:18.323
<v Speaker 2>does it improve insulin sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of the hallmark of </v>

1068
00:48:20.791 --> 00:48:22.410
<v Speaker 2>metabolic health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1069
00:48:22.411 --> 00:48:25.380
<v Speaker 2>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a way to improve your health,</v>

1070
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without even doing anything.</v>

1071
00:48:28.291 --> 00:48:29.124
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can basically just turn the dial on </v>

1072
00:48:29.911 --> 00:48:31.680
<v Speaker 2>your air conditioner down a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

1073
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:32.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1074
00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:33.304
<v Speaker 1>so now let's circle back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This person starts that we're this </v>

1075
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:38.350
<v Speaker 1>imaginary person that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this watching right now.</v>

1076
00:48:38.351 --> 00:48:38.801
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1077
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to incorporate some of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1078
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.090
<v Speaker 1>They're going to get the Eggos Leggo my </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eggo.</v>

1079
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.520
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get that out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Processed food in the morning.</v>

1080
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:49.960
<v Speaker 1>What are they replacing that with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast for dark this day.</v>

1081
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1082
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:51.181
<v Speaker 2>let's start the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1083
00:48:51.181 --> 00:48:52.014
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no biological need for </v>

1084
00:48:53.071 --> 00:48:54.930
<v Speaker 2>breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's just get,</v>

1085
00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get that out of the picture.</v>

1086
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.680
<v Speaker 2>But I thought breakfast was the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important meal of the day.</v>

1087
00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:01.170
<v Speaker 2>The meal that you break your fast with </v>
<v Speaker 2>is important,</v>

1088
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.890
<v Speaker 2>but there's no biological need to eat as</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as you wake up.</v>

1089
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.053
<v Speaker 2>So whether you push that first meal an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour after you wake up or two hours </v>

1090
00:49:09.001 --> 00:49:10.710
<v Speaker 2>after you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to do that.</v>

1091
00:49:10.711 --> 00:49:11.544
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakfast is a fairly new construct in </v>

1092
00:49:13.831 --> 00:49:17.700
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary sense and also when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up first thing in the morning,</v>

1093
00:49:17.701 --> 00:49:20.990
<v Speaker 2>your body has a real unique hormonal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1094
00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.600
<v Speaker 2>mill you where it wants to burn fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1095
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:26.910
<v Speaker 2>cortisol is at its highest peaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately after you wake up.</v>

1096
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.500
<v Speaker 2>And Cortisol is sort of like the body's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat burning hormone.</v>

1097
00:49:29.501 --> 00:49:31.380
<v Speaker 2>It's the body's chief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catabolic hormone,</v>

1098
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.020
<v Speaker 2>liberates stored fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugars,</v>

1099
00:49:34.021 --> 00:49:36.100
<v Speaker 2>proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1100
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.210
<v Speaker 2>and so to throw breakfast into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>equation,</v>

1101
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.170
<v Speaker 2>especially in the most commonly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most commonly consumed form of it,</v>

1102
00:49:43.171 --> 00:49:44.010
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1103
00:49:44.011 --> 00:49:45.420
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Lego,</v>

1104
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.180
<v Speaker 2>an Eggo waffle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:50.960
<v Speaker 1>No offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad Go and Doritos before you know,</v>

1106
00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.650
<v Speaker 1>it is naming some things here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1107
00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1108
00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:57.950
<v Speaker 1>So for the person though that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have something in the morning,</v>

1109
00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.860
<v Speaker 2>fiber and protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so eggs are a perfect foods.</v>

1110
00:50:01.861 --> 00:50:04.980
<v Speaker 2>You eat first thing in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a scramble,</v>

1111
00:50:04.981 --> 00:50:06.480
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some spinach,</v>

1112
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Kale and some extra virgin olive oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could use a little bit of coconut</v>

1113
00:50:10.411 --> 00:50:11.370
<v Speaker 2>oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

1114
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:12.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1115
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.470
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have a condo.</v>

1116
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Are those the two good oils?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because every,</v>

1117
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.360
<v Speaker 1>I feel like every year someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seed oil,</v>

1118
00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know I saw on your website,</v>

1119
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.870
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to do with grape seed oil.</v>

1120
00:50:22.871 --> 00:50:23.704
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

1121
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 1>But when you're cooking you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically you're saying oil or,</v>

1122
00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.820
<v Speaker 2>or you can actually cook with extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>virgin olive oil.</v>

1123
00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:32.730
<v Speaker 2>It maintains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1124
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:36.890
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't oxidize the way some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>awful green and seed oils will,</v>

1125
00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corn oil,</v>

1126
00:50:38.421 --> 00:50:39.650
<v Speaker 2>soybean oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>canola oil,</v>

1127
00:50:39.651 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 2>grapeseed oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the words.</v>

1128
00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:41.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically like the smoke point </v>

1129
00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:43.221
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1130
00:50:43.221 --> 00:50:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Where it becomes</v>

1131
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.350
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>

1132
00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:49.340
<v Speaker 2>and this is a question I get asked a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke point and the temperature at which</v>

1133
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.400
<v Speaker 2>an oil oxidizes there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no relationship.</v>

1134
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.473
<v Speaker 2>So smoke point is something that's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a culinary concern more than anything </v>

1135
00:50:56.181 --> 00:50:59.030
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact these oils like canola oil,</v>

1136
00:50:59.060 --> 00:50:59.893
<v Speaker 2>corn oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soybean oil are so heavily processed in </v>

1137
00:51:01.911 --> 00:51:04.070
<v Speaker 2>order for them to have a high smoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

1138
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:07.040
<v Speaker 2>but actually they become rancid at much </v>
<v Speaker 2>lower temperatures.</v>

1139
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1140
00:51:08.541 --> 00:51:09.650
<v Speaker 2>like a fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like butter,</v>

1141
00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.260
<v Speaker 2>butter will start to smoke pretty early </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1142
00:51:12.261 --> 00:51:15.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because of the fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxidizing is because of the proteins and</v>

1143
00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:15.884
<v Speaker 2>the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trace a lactose and casein found in </v>

1144
00:51:18.321 --> 00:51:19.154
<v Speaker 2>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that actually has no bearing on </v>

1145
00:51:21.021 --> 00:51:23.120
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's good or bad for you.</v>

1146
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:25.450
<v Speaker 1>So basically though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were making,</v>

1147
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an egg omelet.</v>

1148
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

1149
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.790
<v Speaker 1>use some Kale and spinach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about olive oil,</v>

1150
00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:33.100
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about coconut oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>butter or butter.</v>

1151
00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1152
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:34.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1153
00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1154
00:51:35.811 --> 00:51:36.644
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more saturated in oil is the more </v>

1155
00:51:38.931 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 2>chemically stable it's going to be at </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher temperatures.</v>

1156
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.060
<v Speaker 2>So higher heat cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to use coconut oil,</v>

1157
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:45.860
<v Speaker 2>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ghee,</v>

1158
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Lard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tallow,</v>

1159
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:48.104
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

1160
00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:52.450
<v Speaker 1>My coffee right now it's got and mct oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1161
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:53.343
<v Speaker 1>and college unit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really taste like coffee </v>

1162
00:51:54.761 --> 00:51:55.810
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not bad.</v>

1163
00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.260
<v Speaker 2>College is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a great article deep dive into the</v>

1164
00:51:59.261 --> 00:52:01.600
<v Speaker 2>health benefits of Collagen on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>website.</v>

1165
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm an MCT.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oil is great.</v>

1166
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:06.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know</v>

1167
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.400
<v Speaker 1>really seeing people that have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MCT Oil,</v>

1168
00:52:08.401 --> 00:52:11.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like an extract of coconut oil is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1169
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1170
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:15.570
<v Speaker 2>So mct oil is digested differently than </v>
<v Speaker 2>other fats.</v>

1171
00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.260
<v Speaker 2>It basically goes straight to the liver </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes converted to Ketones,</v>

1172
00:52:19.261 --> 00:52:20.094
<v Speaker 2>which are a sort of alternate fuel that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain will readily use when they're </v>

1173
00:52:22.891 --> 00:52:24.210
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1174
00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:28.990
<v Speaker 2>there's some really interesting research</v>
<v Speaker 2>on mct as a potential intervention for,</v>

1175
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:31.830
<v Speaker 2>for patients with Alzheimer's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1176
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:32.933
<v Speaker 2>it might theoretically help people sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of wean themselves off of carbs a by </v>

1177
00:52:35.941 --> 00:52:38.610
<v Speaker 2>sort of supplementing brain energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1178
00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:40.590
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could also,</v>

1179
00:52:40.591 --> 00:52:43.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think just in terms of making you feel</v>

1180
00:52:43.651 --> 00:52:45.210
<v Speaker 2>like you've had something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1181
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.223
<v Speaker 2>first thing in the morning slowing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>release of caffeine into your </v>

1182
00:52:47.911 --> 00:52:49.140
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1183
00:52:49.141 --> 00:52:50.610
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1184
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:51.743
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be careful with the added </v>

1185
00:52:52.201 --> 00:52:54.960
<v Speaker 2>fats because they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not nutrient dense and if you're</v>

1186
00:52:54.961 --> 00:52:55.794
<v Speaker 2>trying to lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no need to add a ton of oils to </v>

1187
00:52:58.171 --> 00:52:58.560
<v Speaker 2>your diet.</v>

1188
00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the irony of where I'm at</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this thing,</v>

1189
00:53:00.541 --> 00:53:01.374
<v Speaker 1>not to make this somehow actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost a couple pounds while doing this </v>

1190
00:53:05.011 --> 00:53:06.960
<v Speaker 1>very high fat thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I hear what you're saying,</v>

1191
00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:07.973
<v Speaker 1>I actually probably could cut down on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and then my body will go to the </v>

1192
00:53:10.381 --> 00:53:12.360
<v Speaker 1>actual instead of the fat and putting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there</v>

1193
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:13.343
<v Speaker 2>and I don't wanna break it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the weight that you lost could be </v>

1194
00:53:14.821 --> 00:53:17.130
<v Speaker 2>water at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1195
00:53:17.131 --> 00:53:19.160
<v Speaker 2>adding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adding oils to the,</v>

1196
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:21.690
<v Speaker 2>to break that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what you do.</v>

1197
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.033
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>

1198
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you have basically</v>

1199
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.963
<v Speaker 2>an Omelet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to that effect in the morning </v>

1200
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.200
<v Speaker 2>with some Greens in there or yogurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full fat yogurt,</v>

1201
00:53:31.201 --> 00:53:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Grass Fed yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1202
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that I think is great.</v>

1203
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Can you explain why grass fed is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>important?</v>

1204
00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:38.694
<v Speaker 2>Because I feel like there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>set of people that are always kind of </v>

1205
00:53:40.371 --> 00:53:41.100
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1206
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:41.933
<v Speaker 2>you go to get grayed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you brass bed like that doesn't do </v>

1207
00:53:44.161 --> 00:53:45.660
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no it.</v>

1208
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Well it dictates the healthiness of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

1209
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:48.743
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're talking about like grass </v>

1210
00:53:50.021 --> 00:53:50.854
<v Speaker 2>fed whey protein for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes much less of a difference because </v>

1211
00:53:53.761 --> 00:53:57.300
<v Speaker 2>whey protein is just pure protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're talking about,</v>

1212
00:53:57.301 --> 00:53:59.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece of red meat or something,</v>

1213
00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 2>grass fed red meat compared to grain fed</v>
<v Speaker 2>red meat,</v>

1214
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:05.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a different animal even though it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same animal.</v>

1215
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:08.880
<v Speaker 2>It's basically one in grass fed red </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

1216
00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.713
<v Speaker 2>You have a ratio of Omega six fats to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Omega three fats that basically mirrors </v>

1217
00:54:13.651 --> 00:54:16.890
<v Speaker 2>that of the human brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a lot more carotinoids,</v>

1218
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:17.963
<v Speaker 2>which are basically these fat soluble </v>
<v Speaker 2>antioxidant compounds that have been </v>

1219
00:54:21.121 --> 00:54:23.280
<v Speaker 2>shown to boost processing speed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

1220
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 2>which is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cows that eat grass grass contains these</v>

1221
00:54:27.451 --> 00:54:30.000
<v Speaker 2>carotenoids carotinoids which are fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>soluble.</v>

1222
00:54:30.001 --> 00:54:31.890
<v Speaker 2>They become embedded in the fat of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cow.</v>

1223
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:34.830
<v Speaker 2>And so when you eat a piece of steak </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a cow that's been grass fed,</v>

1224
00:54:34.831 --> 00:54:35.664
<v Speaker 2>you're eating those carotinoids along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with fat that helps you absorb it </v>

1225
00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:40.710
<v Speaker 2>because they need fat to be absorbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1226
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a really healthy food when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1227
00:54:43.711 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about grass fed meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in terms of Yogurt,</v>

1228
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:50.670
<v Speaker 2>grass fed yogurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full fat can have,</v>

1229
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few Omega threes.</v>

1230
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:54.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not a major source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got Cla,</v>

1231
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:57.110
<v Speaker 2>vitaminK ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two M,</v>

1232
00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.313
<v Speaker 2>much higher in grass fed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the fat of grass Fed Full Fat Yogurt </v>

1233
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Than Conventional Yogurt.</v>

1234
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:07.470
<v Speaker 2>I feel like lunch is the hard one for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people at work.</v>

1235
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:10.590
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are barely leaving their</v>
<v Speaker 2>desks at work.</v>

1236
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Even for me working from home even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm so busy during the day,</v>

1237
00:55:14.461 --> 00:55:14.970
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1238
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:18.480
<v Speaker 2>we just got to grab something or get </v>
<v Speaker 2>chipotle a or whatever it is.</v>

1239
00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:21.130
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can you do in the mid day?</v>

1240
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:23.820
<v Speaker 2>You can have a relatively healthy meal </v>
<v Speaker 2>at chipotle.</v>

1241
00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Chipotle is still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1242
00:55:25.261 --> 00:55:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I think in all of their options has </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses,</v>

1243
00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those oils,</v>

1244
00:55:30.261 --> 00:55:32.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>green and probably canola oil.</v>

1245
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure which.</v>

1246
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:37.380
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can get guacamole there,</v>

1247
00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:39.100
<v Speaker 2>which is certainly very healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1248
00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 2>avocado is incredible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's again packed with carotinoids.</v>

1249
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:45.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Avocado has twice the potassium,</v>

1250
00:55:45.451 --> 00:55:46.770
<v Speaker 2>have a banana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing.</v>

1251
00:55:46.771 --> 00:55:48.990
<v Speaker 2>People think about potassium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only think about bananas.</v>

1252
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:50.543
<v Speaker 2>I'm very low carb food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get some protein a and then the </v>

1253
00:55:54.391 --> 00:55:55.950
<v Speaker 2>salsa I think is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1254
00:55:55.951 --> 00:55:58.380
<v Speaker 2>so you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bell peppers are great.</v>

1255
00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.753
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally what I tell people for </v>

1256
00:56:00.901 --> 00:56:01.734
<v Speaker 2>launches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great opportunity during the day </v>

1257
00:56:02.851 --> 00:56:03.684
<v Speaker 2>to eat a salad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people should be eating a large </v>

1258
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.140
<v Speaker 2>salad every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1259
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.113
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the research is pretty compelling and </v>

1260
00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:13.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanistically it makes sense that dark</v>

1261
00:56:13.651 --> 00:56:15.480
<v Speaker 2>leafy Greens would be really good for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1262
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.420
<v Speaker 2>They are the most nutrient dense foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

1263
00:56:18.421 --> 00:56:20.970
<v Speaker 2>meaning there's tons of nutrients for </v>
<v Speaker 2>very few calories.</v>

1264
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:23.740
<v Speaker 2>They're packed with dietary fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1265
00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:24.574
<v Speaker 2>will not only help fill you up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it feeds the microorganisms that </v>

1266
00:56:27.371 --> 00:56:29.470
<v Speaker 2>live in your large intestine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is called the microbiome,</v>

1267
00:56:29.471 --> 00:56:32.320
<v Speaker 2>which is a really exciting focus now in </v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

1268
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:33.843
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you want to make that solid fat and </v>

1269
00:56:35.951 --> 00:56:37.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean by putting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1270
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:39.310
<v Speaker 2>tortilla strips and ranch dressing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese on it,</v>

1271
00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:41.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even commercial salad dressings.</v>

1272
00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.093
<v Speaker 2>You really want to avoid those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was no better vehicle for </v>

1273
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:48.670
<v Speaker 2>extra virgin olive oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then a salad and extra virgin olive oil.</v>

1274
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Going back to the Mediterranean dietary </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern,</v>

1275
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:53.530
<v Speaker 2>it's a hallmark and they've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>

1276
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:54.543
<v Speaker 2>randomized controlled trials where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>look specifically at extra virgin olive </v>

1277
00:56:57.731 --> 00:56:59.110
<v Speaker 2>oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

1278
00:56:59.140 --> 00:56:59.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of best studies to look at was </v>

1279
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:04.953
<v Speaker 2>done out of Barcelona,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spain called the pre med study where </v>

1280
00:57:06.521 --> 00:57:09.550
<v Speaker 2>they gave subjects a leader of extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>virgin olive oil,</v>

1281
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:12.700
<v Speaker 2>extra virgin olive oil to consume per </v>
<v Speaker 2>week and they found that,</v>

1282
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the trial,</v>

1283
00:57:15.101 --> 00:57:17.980
<v Speaker 2>went on for six years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had improved cognitive function,</v>

1284
00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:18.814
<v Speaker 2>they had improved risk factors for </v>
<v Speaker 2>cardiovascular disease and they even </v>

1285
00:57:21.071 --> 00:57:23.590
<v Speaker 2>lost weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by adding more fat to their diet,</v>

1286
00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:26.410
<v Speaker 2>they ended up losing weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it was extra virgin olive oil,</v>

1287
00:57:26.411 --> 00:57:27.820
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1288
00:57:27.821 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 2>So now we've had the Omelette started </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>

1289
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.220
<v Speaker 2>We've had a big green leafy salad for </v>
<v Speaker 2>lunch.</v>

1290
00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some protein in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happening in for dinner.</v>

1291
00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for dinner,</v>

1292
00:57:37.391 --> 00:57:38.224
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of grass fed red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the more </v>

1293
00:57:42.101 --> 00:57:45.940
<v Speaker 2>controversial tips that I give people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because meat has sort of been in the dog</v>

1294
00:57:45.941 --> 00:57:46.774
<v Speaker 2>house for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought one day a week or red </v>

1295
00:57:49.481 --> 00:57:50.261
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1296
00:57:50.261 --> 00:57:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is I don't.</v>

1297
00:57:51.281 --> 00:57:52.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1298
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:53.763
<v Speaker 2>there was a really great study performed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Charlotte Newman at Ucla where they </v>

1299
00:57:56.411 --> 00:57:57.244
<v Speaker 2>gave a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was again a randomized controlled </v>

1300
00:57:59.291 --> 00:58:01.150
<v Speaker 2>trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave children in Kenya,</v>

1301
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:06.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this a traditional porridge dish made of</v>

1302
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:08.890
<v Speaker 2>beans and green beans and things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1303
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1304
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.080
<v Speaker 2>what a control group had just the sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of vegetarian version.</v>

1305
00:58:14.081 --> 00:58:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Then they gave a group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1306
00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:17.043
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a version with dairy and then they gave </v>

1307
00:58:18.701 --> 00:58:22.030
<v Speaker 2>a group a version with meat and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>found that the kids that were given,</v>

1308
00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:25.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the version with supplemented meat added</v>

1309
00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:25.834
<v Speaker 2>meet actually at the end of the trial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had improved cognitive function and </v>

1310
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:30.100
<v Speaker 2>signs of mental health.</v>

1311
00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:35.100
<v Speaker 2>So there's other research actually from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a that I site engineers,</v>

1312
00:58:36.131 --> 00:58:38.200
<v Speaker 2>foods from Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deacon University,</v>

1313
00:58:38.201 --> 00:58:43.201
<v Speaker 2>where they found that women who didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>consume the nationally recommended three</v>

1314
00:58:43.511 --> 00:58:44.344
<v Speaker 2>to four servings of red meat per week </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually had twice the risk for </v>

1315
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:50.860
<v Speaker 2>depression or anxiety or mood disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1316
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:51.941
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1317
00:58:51.941 --> 00:58:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1318
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:54.303
<v Speaker 2>what's called like a u shaped curve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think definitely some red meat is </v>

1319
00:58:57.311 --> 00:59:00.220
<v Speaker 2>better than none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eating too much isn't great either.</v>

1320
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:03.310
<v Speaker 2>You definitely want to have a diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's rich in vegetables,</v>

1321
00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.100
<v Speaker 2>dark leafy Greens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kale,</v>

1322
00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:07.120
<v Speaker 2>spinach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

1323
00:59:07.121 --> 00:59:10.870
<v Speaker 2>But in that context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that eating properly raised meat</v>

1324
00:59:10.871 --> 00:59:14.830
<v Speaker 2>is definitely a definitely healthy fatty</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish for dinner would be another,</v>

1325
00:59:14.831 --> 00:59:15.664
<v Speaker 2>another option,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fishes packed with micronutrients that </v>

1326
00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:21.590
<v Speaker 2>the brain needs to create new cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we now know the adult brain can do</v>

1327
00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:23.420
<v Speaker 2>up until death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1328
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.480
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1329
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:27.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1330
00:59:27.171 --> 00:59:28.004
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1331
00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:29.180
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of options.</v>

1332
00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1333
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:33.320
<v Speaker 2>when you look at a plate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to have half of it,</v>

1334
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:36.890
<v Speaker 2>vegetables and half of it and meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think eating,</v>

1335
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:40.670
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think incorrect interpretations of the</v>

1336
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Paleo Diet is that it's meant to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really high meat diet.</v>

1337
00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:44.043
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that ignores a lot of the </v>

1338
00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:47.540
<v Speaker 2>research now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding the microbiome,</v>

1339
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:50.240
<v Speaker 2>which is this area that's very new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1340
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:51.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1341
00:59:51.861 --> 00:59:54.350
<v Speaker 2>we want to get a good amount of dietary </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiber,</v>

1342
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.120
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the brain needs,</v>

1343
00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:57.243
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's no better way to do that </v>

1344
00:59:58.071 --> 00:59:59.570
<v Speaker 2>then with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than with veggies.</v>

1345
00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:00.150
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1346
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>how often do you cheat on this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm guessing a certain amount of</v>

1347
01:00:03.751 --> 01:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>people that are watching this going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1348
01:00:05.041 --> 01:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>this is what this guy does for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's writing books about it,</v>

1349
01:00:08.431 --> 01:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has the time to prepare meals the way</v>

1350
01:00:11.281 --> 01:00:12.280
<v Speaker 1>he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

1351
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:13.123
<v Speaker 1>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How oftEn do you go off the deep end </v>

1352
01:00:15.301 --> 01:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1353
01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean that on something a couple times </v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

1354
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:20.310
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1355
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.173
<v Speaker 2>I think I think I'd have the cravings </v>
<v Speaker 2>for ice cream or I don't to be totally </v>

1356
01:00:27.301 --> 01:00:29.910
<v Speaker 2>honest and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always had a huge sweet tooth.</v>

1357
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1358
01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:32.820
<v Speaker 2>yeaH,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really.</v>

1359
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Once I made the transition to a lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>carb diet,</v>

1360
01:00:35.401 --> 01:00:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't have those cravings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1361
01:00:36.811 --> 01:00:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I can comfortably go hours without </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>

1362
01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:43.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a really good subjective </v>
<v Speaker 2>sign of metabolic resilience.</v>

1363
01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>What about alcohol?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that fit into this?</v>

1364
01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I know you mentioned the one glass of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine for a woman.</v>

1365
01:00:48.751 --> 01:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>What are they one and a half to two </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to for men per day?</v>

1366
01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:53.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D is that basically align with what </v>

1367
01:00:54.691 --> 01:00:55.524
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

1368
01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:59.120
<v Speaker 2>There's some researchers recommend </v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming red wine.</v>

1369
01:00:59.121 --> 01:00:59.954
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the sort of mind diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a dietary sort of pattern that </v>

1370
01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:08.170
<v Speaker 2>was created at rush university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>

1371
01:01:08.171 --> 01:01:09.004
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hard to study alcohol </v>

1372
01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:12.164
<v Speaker 2>because on the one hand it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful social lubricant and feeling </v>

1373
01:01:14.901 --> 01:01:16.900
<v Speaker 2>connected to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1374
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.080
<v Speaker 2>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1375
01:01:18.081 --> 01:01:21.530
<v Speaker 2>as a solvent for stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really powerful.</v>

1376
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not to be discounted,</v>

1377
01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:25.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live stressful lives and there's sort</v>

1378
01:01:25.031 --> 01:01:27.080
<v Speaker 2>of no way around that for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for many people,</v>

1379
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.350
<v Speaker 2>but ethanol is a neurotoxin and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1380
01:01:30.351 --> 01:01:33.830
<v Speaker 2>if you have a way of dealing with stress</v>
<v Speaker 2>and feeling connected with,</v>

1381
01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with one another,</v>

1382
01:01:35.181 --> 01:01:37.400
<v Speaker 2>without it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're probably better off doing</v>

1383
01:01:37.401 --> 01:01:38.234
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do give some tips in the book </v>

1384
01:01:40.761 --> 01:01:45.200
<v Speaker 2>about how to make consuming alcohol as </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy and experiences as possible.</v>

1385
01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.034
<v Speaker 2>You want to avoid sugary mixers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think beer is one of the least </v>

1386
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:51.450
<v Speaker 2>healthiest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1387
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:54.620
<v Speaker 2>alcohols that you can consume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1388
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:56.810
<v Speaker 2>you always want to follow the one for </v>
<v Speaker 2>one rule,</v>

1389
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:58.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chase every drink with a glass of water.</v>

1390
01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:00.230
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1391
01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:04.730
<v Speaker 2>alcohol is a diuretic and when you pee a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot you excrete sodium.</v>

1392
01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:07.640
<v Speaker 2>And so by replenishing those </v>
<v Speaker 2>electrolytes,</v>

1393
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:08.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1394
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:10.880
<v Speaker 2>while you were drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really important.</v>

1395
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:12.890
<v Speaker 2>So sprinkle a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of salt in your water,</v>

1396
01:02:12.891 --> 01:02:14.180
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could Be one way to do that,</v>

1397
01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize that like you don't</v>

1398
01:02:15.681 --> 01:02:16.514
<v Speaker 1>need down a gatorade just because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost a couple of electrolytes was </v>

1399
01:02:18.361 --> 01:02:19.540
<v Speaker 1>literally just a little salt in your</v>

1400
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:20.560
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of salt.</v>

1401
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1402
01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:24.700
<v Speaker 2>I actually became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've become really interested in salt.</v>

1403
01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:25.623
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1404
01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:26.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

1405
01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:27.373
<v Speaker 2>I carry a little vial of salt in my gym </v>
<v Speaker 2>bag now and after a good sauna session </v>

1406
01:02:30.311 --> 01:02:32.830
<v Speaker 2>or workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sprinkle a little bit in my mouth,</v>

1407
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.880
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1408
01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you lose,</v>

1409
01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:36.230
<v Speaker 2>you lose.</v>

1410
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:37.130
<v Speaker 1>People are not going to be happy.</v>

1411
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.570
<v Speaker 2>They're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be happy about that.</v>

1412
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.433
<v Speaker 2>You lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're on a low carb </v>

1413
01:02:40.821 --> 01:02:42.470
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you drop the carbs,</v>

1414
01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.240
<v Speaker 2>your Insulin comes down and insulin </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically tells the kidneys to hold onto</v>

1415
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:48.200
<v Speaker 2>sodium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>know unnaturally.</v>

1416
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:50.480
<v Speaker 2>So for people that are on a really hIgh </v>
<v Speaker 2>carb diet,</v>

1417
01:02:50.481 --> 01:02:51.314
<v Speaker 2>which most most americans are consuming </v>
<v Speaker 2>300 grams of carbs a day with insulin </v>

1418
01:02:54.291 --> 01:02:57.620
<v Speaker 2>levels constantly elevated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're holding onto excess sodium.</v>

1419
01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:58.693
<v Speaker 2>So the recommendation to watch your </v>
<v Speaker 2>sodium intake In that sort of context </v>

1420
01:03:02.901 --> 01:03:05.360
<v Speaker 2>makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're eating a low carb diet,</v>

1421
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.810
<v Speaker 2>as you should focus on whole foods that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not,</v>

1422
01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>packed with starch,</v>

1423
01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.840
<v Speaker 2>you really need to be mindful of not </v>
<v Speaker 2>only your sodium intake because again,</v>

1424
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:17.780
<v Speaker 2>sodium sodium's a nutrient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not this poison that,</v>

1425
01:03:17.810 --> 01:03:18.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think it was looking at the </v>

1426
01:03:20.181 --> 01:03:21.440
<v Speaker 2>labels of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1427
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:22.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>processed foods that are low in sodium </v>

1428
01:03:24.171 --> 01:03:26.480
<v Speaker 2>and that's somehow supposed to make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay that you're eating,</v>

1429
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:29.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of sugar and processed wheat.</v>

1430
01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1431
01:03:31.881 --> 01:03:33.140
<v Speaker 2>So you need to really be mindful of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1432
01:03:33.141 --> 01:03:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And then you do other things in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle that,</v>

1433
01:03:34.821 --> 01:03:37.190
<v Speaker 2>that accelerate the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1434
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:39.740
<v Speaker 2>the spilling of sodium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like exercise,</v>

1435
01:03:39.741 --> 01:03:40.574
<v Speaker 2>drinking coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which causes you to pee out a lot of </v>

1436
01:03:41.811 --> 01:03:42.644
<v Speaker 2>sodium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a great interview with a </v>

1437
01:03:45.291 --> 01:03:47.600
<v Speaker 2>researcher who focuses on this topic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1438
01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:48.681
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

1439
01:03:48.681 --> 01:03:52.070
<v Speaker 2>it's an area of interest for me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely when I,</v>

1440
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:53.323
<v Speaker 2>when I wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm doing like one of my really </v>

1441
01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:59.090
<v Speaker 2>particularly low carb phases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll sprinkle,</v>

1442
01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of salt in my water and it </v>

1443
01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:01.754
<v Speaker 2>makes me feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives me like a boost of energy I </v>

1444
01:04:03.531 --> 01:04:04.320
<v Speaker 2>feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1445
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.131
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1446
01:04:05.131 --> 01:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>so let's go full circle here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically about six years ago,</v>

1447
01:04:08.551 --> 01:04:11.660
<v Speaker 1>that's when this all started and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your mom was diagnosed,</v>

1448
01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:14.250
<v Speaker 1>he obviously changed her life </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

1449
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>changed your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1450
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.390
<v Speaker 1>where's your mom at now and how have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1451
01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:20.460
<v Speaker 1>everything we've talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this last hour,</v>

1452
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:25.640
<v Speaker 1>how have you been able to incorporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>them into her lIfe and,</v>

1453
01:04:25.641 --> 01:04:26.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see,</v>

1454
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:27.480
<v Speaker 1>see some changes.</v>

1455
01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1456
01:04:28.561 --> 01:04:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried,</v>

1457
01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.210
<v Speaker 2>especially when I moved from la back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>

1458
01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.613
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1459
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I really tried to take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1460
01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.070
<v Speaker 2>super hands on approach for as long as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could with my mom to change her diet and</v>

1461
01:04:40.071 --> 01:04:42.380
<v Speaker 2>certainly some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some aspects of her diet has changed.</v>

1462
01:04:42.381 --> 01:04:43.910
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1463
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:44.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dementia is a horrible disease and it </v>

1464
01:04:47.601 --> 01:04:50.600
<v Speaker 2>makes it really hard on both the patient</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the caregiver,</v>

1465
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:52.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1466
01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.240
<v Speaker 2>to adhere to a strict dietary </v>
<v Speaker 2>interventions.</v>

1467
01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a study that I was that I dove</v>

1468
01:04:58.701 --> 01:05:03.230
<v Speaker 2>into recently where they put people with</v>
<v Speaker 2>alzheimer's disease,</v>

1469
01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:06.230
<v Speaker 2>both mIld to moderate alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease on a ketogenic diet.</v>

1470
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:07.363
<v Speaker 2>And they found that one of the major </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations of the study is that </v>

1471
01:05:08.931 --> 01:05:11.300
<v Speaker 2>adherence is so high to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1472
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.850
<v Speaker 2>to these diets and it's a major stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the caregiver.</v>

1473
01:05:13.851 --> 01:05:18.851
<v Speaker 2>I'm not my mom's caregiver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm at a certain point I had to kind</v>

1474
01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:22.240
<v Speaker 2>of teach and step back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1475
01:05:22.241 --> 01:05:23.050
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1476
01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:27.460
<v Speaker 2>if I am around my mom and she's craving </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that isn't max approved,</v>

1477
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:29.470
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't affect my relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

1478
01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:30.304
<v Speaker 2>Because first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love my mom and I don't want to do </v>

1479
01:05:33.461 --> 01:05:36.100
<v Speaker 2>anything to compromise the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>or her quality of life.</v>

1480
01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.353
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1481
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:41.120
<v Speaker 1>I wonder is there any work done that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with dementia,</v>

1482
01:05:41.121 --> 01:05:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I can sort of remember this from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother who had dementia and I spent</v>

1483
01:05:43.701 --> 01:05:47.420
<v Speaker 1>a lot of time with her her last few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years that she was an incredible cook,</v>

1484
01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:48.254
<v Speaker 1>used to cook all sorts of exotic things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in her later years as the dementia </v>

1485
01:05:51.861 --> 01:05:52.694
<v Speaker 1>kicked in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she really only wanted the same few </v>

1486
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:55.610
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

1487
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.493
<v Speaker 1>do you think somehow connected to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just certain things maybe that </v>

1488
01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:00.670
<v Speaker 1>are still in the memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1489
01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>like she really suddenly wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken soup all the time,</v>

1490
01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.633
<v Speaker 1>but I don't remember really her having </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken soup for many years before that </v>

1491
01:06:06.621 --> 01:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>she would cook these crazy meals.</v>

1492
01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the only shift in food preference</v>

1493
01:06:11.361 --> 01:06:16.361
<v Speaker 2>that I'm familiar with is a shift </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards a sweeter foods which occUrs and</v>

1494
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:17.893
<v Speaker 2>it's thought that that happens because a</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain with alzheimer's disease is </v>

1495
01:06:20.621 --> 01:06:22.760
<v Speaker 2>essentially being starved of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1496
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:26.510
<v Speaker 2>one of its primary energy substrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is glucose.</v>

1497
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:31.310
<v Speaker 2>So there's thIs notion that alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease is a form of diabetes,</v>

1498
01:06:31.311 --> 01:06:32.144
<v Speaker 2>of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's essentially become unable to </v>

1499
01:06:33.111 --> 01:06:33.944
<v Speaker 2>properly process glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where ketogenic interventions </v>

1500
01:06:37.311 --> 01:06:38.144
<v Speaker 2>have shown a lot of promise and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that that might be really </v>

1501
01:06:39.861 --> 01:06:42.080
<v Speaker 2>helpful for a patient with alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

1502
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the thIngs that,</v>

1503
01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:48.230
<v Speaker 2>that sort of strengthens that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that notion is that they,</v>

1504
01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.420
<v Speaker 2>that people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1505
01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:50.254
<v Speaker 2>that that perhaps never expressed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>preference for sweet foods or had a </v>

1506
01:06:53.151 --> 01:06:53.984
<v Speaker 2>sweet tooth begins to crave sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sad that that's sort of the brain </v>

1507
01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:59.870
<v Speaker 2>crying out for sugar as a means of </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating energy.</v>

1508
01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:01.213
<v Speaker 2>But the irony is that those are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact kinds of foods that drive </v>

1509
01:07:03.471 --> 01:07:04.304
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and insulin resistance in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the body and that are so detrimental to </v>

1510
01:07:08.601 --> 01:07:09.440
<v Speaker 2>the brain to begin with.</v>

1511
01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.880
<v Speaker 2>There's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's really interesting,</v>

1512
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:16.370
<v Speaker 2>yOu know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ketogenic diets are a,</v>

1513
01:07:16.371 --> 01:07:20.030
<v Speaker 2>I think they've become a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>buzzworthy these days and popular,</v>

1514
01:07:20.031 --> 01:07:22.850
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of good research on </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1515
01:07:22.851 --> 01:07:23.684
<v Speaker 2>they're hard to study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of money to go around </v>

1516
01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:26.270
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to really,</v>

1517
01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:28.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to study them.</v>

1518
01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:32.300
<v Speaker 2>But there's good evidence that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my friends,</v>

1519
01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.193
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>published a study on patients with mild </v>

1520
01:07:34.461 --> 01:07:35.294
<v Speaker 2>cognitive impairment where putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients with mild cognitive impairment </v>

1521
01:07:39.261 --> 01:07:40.094
<v Speaker 2>on a ketogenic diet seem to improve </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive function and then just </v>

1522
01:07:42.681 --> 01:07:45.530
<v Speaker 2>recently that was extended to patients </v>
<v Speaker 2>with alzheimer's disease,</v>

1523
01:07:45.531 --> 01:07:46.364
<v Speaker 2>which we were all waiting for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all waiting for a ketogenic trial </v>

1524
01:07:48.681 --> 01:07:52.130
<v Speaker 2>to be performed on patients with </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed alzheimer's disease.</v>

1525
01:07:52.131 --> 01:07:55.850
<v Speaker 2>And it seemed that for the patients that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were able to adhere to it,</v>

1526
01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:57.013
<v Speaker 2>there was a sIgnificant improvement in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their cognitive function when they were </v>

1527
01:08:00.081 --> 01:08:00.914
<v Speaker 2>on that diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they went back to their baseline </v>

1528
01:08:03.231 --> 01:08:05.210
<v Speaker 2>level of cognitive function after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trial ended,</v>

1529
01:08:05.211 --> 01:08:06.044
<v Speaker 2>which really strengthens the notion that</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones were helping the brain sort of </v>

1530
01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:12.090
<v Speaker 2>as an energetic life raft.</v>

1531
01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.093
<v Speaker 1>It seems that the main takeaway here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>do some of the preventional work </v>

1532
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.600
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1533
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:18.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alzheimer's disease begins in the brain </v>

1534
01:08:19.461 --> 01:08:21.440
<v Speaker 1>30 to 40 years before the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>symptoms,</v>

1535
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the first symptom.</v>

1536
01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:23.924
<v Speaker 1>And there's even some data suggesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this could be a lifelong thing for </v>

1537
01:08:26.931 --> 01:08:30.980
<v Speaker 1>people with certain genes that put them </v>
<v Speaker 1>at higher risk for alzheimer's disease.</v>

1538
01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Like the apoe e four allele,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one in four people carry?</v>

1539
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1540
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:35.893
<v Speaker 1>well it's a pleasure to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become a master of your craft and I </v>

1541
01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:40.370
<v Speaker 1>think it maybe has a little something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with what you're eating.</v>

1542
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1543
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.550
<v Speaker 1>you're pulling information pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

1544
01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>So I think you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proof is in the,</v>

1545
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:47.443
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten free pudding or something like </v>

1546
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:51.890

1548
01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:54.710
