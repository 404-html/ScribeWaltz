00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.443
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is Kelly Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter of the legendary comedian </v>

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:06.624
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly is an author and a speaker who's </v>

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>work connects many of the dots her </v>
<v Speaker 1>father's life was all about.</v>

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I've known Kelly for about four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>now after connecting with her on twitter</v>

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>because of how much I admired her dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we become great friends.</v>

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.554
<v Speaker 1>Kelly is welcomed me into her world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedy community She's part of here </v>

7
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:23.484
<v Speaker 1>in la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought Kelly would be the perfect </v>

8
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:25.404
<v Speaker 1>guest this week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only because of her new book about </v>

9
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:27.684
<v Speaker 1>growing up as a Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because of all the issues her </v>

10
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:31.074
<v Speaker 1>father's comedy was about that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes central themes of what we do </v>

11
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:34.854
<v Speaker 1>here on this show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin was a relentless defender </v>

12
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>of free speech using words and language </v>
<v Speaker 1>to push the limits of what society found</v>

13
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>acceptable at the time he railed against</v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness.</v>

14
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.743
<v Speaker 1>Like no other comment before or anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>since he dissected the absurdities of </v>

15
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>life that ultimately bring us together </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than rip us apart.</v>

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.533
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how often I'm watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>some campaign nonsense or some </v>

17
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous politically correct crusade </v>
<v Speaker 1>and think,</v>

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.143
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish George Carlin was still alive to </v>

19
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:02.484
<v Speaker 1>tackle this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do I want you to see George </v>

20
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Carlin in a new way by sitting down with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly,</v>

21
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>but I also want to use our chat as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

22
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>breathing example of something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going on here.</v>

23
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly and I met on twitter.</v>

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.263
<v Speaker 1>All I was to her was another person </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting at her in 140 characters who </v>

25
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>had some connection to her father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like millions of other people,</v>

26
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>but through social media we met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we became friends,</v>

27
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>and now we share so much of our lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our passions together.</v>

28
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.953
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's so cool about what's </v>

29
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>happening here with you guys.</v>

30
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>The reaction to what we're doing has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten to a whole new level.</v>

31
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I've been getting emails from literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the world,</v>

32
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:36.924
<v Speaker 1>from Denmark to Saudi Arabia to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're connecting because of the same </v>

33
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>ideas that George believed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe in and which you believe</v>

34
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:44.851
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

35
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that we agree on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything actually,</v>

36
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>in almost every email I get that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaping praise on me.</v>

37
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>You guys managed to tell me something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we disagree on.</v>

38
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:53.604
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this is all about and it's </v>

39
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>precisely what the far right and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regressive left fear.</v>

40
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.323
<v Speaker 1>If the rest of us can wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that we can come together </v>

41
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>despite differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can't control us.</v>

42
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:05.694
<v Speaker 1>It's really as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The authoritarians that exist on both </v>

43
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:08.964
<v Speaker 1>sides want control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the best way to do that is to keep </v>

44
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone hating on each other all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

45
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>For all the things that Milo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yiannopoulos and I disagreed on,</v>

46
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:21.981
<v Speaker 1>this is one spot we had total agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rise of the Cultural Libertarians is</v>

47
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>here and it contains people from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the cultural map,</v>

48
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>from Chris Rock to Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from marginalized to Sam Harris.</v>

49
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>If George Carlin was still around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he would fit right in there,</v>

50
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.473
<v Speaker 1>but it would have also been shared to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make fun of any group that would have </v>

51
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>accepted him as part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point of all this is that every week</v>

52
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:39.834
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day that I've been doing this </v>

53
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this movement getting stronger.</v>

54
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>You guys are not only connecting with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with each other,</v>

55
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 1>and now when I see the usual regressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>spout off their nonsense,</v>

56
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>there's an army of people calling them </v>
<v Speaker 1>out on it.</v>

57
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>That is literally as important as </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that I do.</v>

58
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin's most famous routine was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the seven dirty words.</v>

59
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>You can't say on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live</v>

60
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.873
<v Speaker 2>in a time that's getting dangerously </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to the several dirty ideas that </v>

61
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 2>you can't challenge publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's honor the trailblazers before us,</v>

62
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:08.044
<v Speaker 2>like George Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by relentlessly challenging and </v>

63
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 2>ruthlessly mocking those who would </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt to silence us.</v>

64
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do a show.</v>

65
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 2>My guest this week is an author,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a speaker,</v>

66
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.710
<v Speaker 2>and a one woman show or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

67
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.183
<v Speaker 2>Her new book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Carlin home companion tells her </v>

68
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:28.970
<v Speaker 2>journey growing up as the daughter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>George and Brenda Carla,</v>

69
00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 2>and she's also my friend and throws a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell of a party.</v>

70
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.871
<v Speaker 2>Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carla,</v>

71
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 2>and welcome to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so excited to be here.</v>

72
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.614
<v Speaker 2>This is so fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it seem more mature than </v>

73
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 2>anything we've done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've grown up right now.</v>

74
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of scaring me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very grown up.</v>

75
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.133
<v Speaker 2>Before we start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just pointed to our window at this </v>

76
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>picture in case now I know we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're blowing the illusion television,</v>

77
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 2>but that is a picture.</v>

78
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not an actual window that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

79
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.623
<v Speaker 2>the upper west side that's 89th street </v>
<v Speaker 2>facing north and just a little bit past </v>

80
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:03.964
<v Speaker 2>where this picture ends is actually just</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the last year a street that is now </v>

81
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:09.034
<v Speaker 2>named after your father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't where I was intending to </v>

82
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:11.481
<v Speaker 2>start with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let,</v>

83
00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 2>let's start there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your Dad now is a street,</v>

84
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 2>has officially a street a at 121st and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amsterdam.</v>

85
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 2>We wanted it to be between Broadway and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amsterdam,</v>

86
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.990
<v Speaker 2>but there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the block he grew up on,</v>

87
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a church there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The church,</v>

88
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 2>his mother attended the church that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

89
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 2>the school that he attended as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was kicked out of that church,</v>

90
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:34.024
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't where he was kicked out of the </v>

91
00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let take down to the school.</v>

92
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 2>And then he was allowed to come back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate for eighth grade,</v>

93
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 2>but he had to write the play in order to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back in which they were great.</v>

94
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 2>It was actually a very progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>school for a Catholic school.</v>

95
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the irony is,</v>

96
00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 2>is that once we wanted to name the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

97
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 2>the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a got all up in arms about it,</v>

98
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.843
<v Speaker 2>a worried well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they claimed that they were worried </v>

99
00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:57.604
<v Speaker 2>about kids coming out of school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking up and seeing the name and then </v>

100
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.983
<v Speaker 2>googling it and finding out about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven dirty words that was their </v>

101
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 2>concern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

102
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 2>not a huge fan of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never more worried about the religion is</v>

103
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 2>bullshit video that they would probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>find on youtube video.</v>

104
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:17.750
<v Speaker 2>There must be 50 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is probably as a.</v>

105
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 2>we're working on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to,</v>

106
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organize all of that.</v>

107
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

108
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 2>but you can go to 121st and Amsterdam on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side of the street.</v>

109
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a George Carlin way,</v>

110
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.703
<v Speaker 2>so just to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live so it's on the same street </v>

111
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just pushed it one block,</v>

112
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.820
<v Speaker 2>they just put it across the street on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amsterdam because I mean it's,</v>

113
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once again,</v>

114
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:40.774
<v Speaker 2>it's just the thing that churches have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these lines that they draw and they're </v>

115
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

116
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.143
<v Speaker 2>But the good news is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when all this went down was it </v>

117
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 2>got us so much press that it ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>being like a kind of a funny thing.</v>

118
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:53.374
<v Speaker 2>They actually got us more attention for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the street sign that I think they </v>

119
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 2>probably would have wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although every comic in the world wanted</v>

120
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.684
<v Speaker 2>to be there that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you had a Zillion zillion amazing </v>

121
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Kevin Bartini the comic.</v>

122
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 2>He's the one who initiated it and did it</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

123
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:07.814
<v Speaker 2>But Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had Colin Quinn and Dave attell and </v>

124
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

125
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a great day.</v>

126
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.253
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that what I'm putting </v>

127
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:15.741
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

128
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 2>we did this because I used to live on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the upper west side.</v>

129
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's a nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice way to feel at home.</v>

130
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as I said in my intro,</v>

131
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I that I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>about having you here,</v>

132
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 2>and we've been doing this kind of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever,</v>

133
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.893
<v Speaker 2>but one of the reasons that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly apropos now beyond just </v>

134
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>your book is that all of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>your dad stood for,</v>

135
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 2>I think are really coming to fruition </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

136
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.170
<v Speaker 2>There's something again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

137
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a cyclical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

138
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.453
<v Speaker 2>It's like this endless thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like there's a moment now </v>

139
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 2>between religion and political </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness and free speech,</v>

140
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 2>these things that he railed on more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody and did better than anybody.</v>

141
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 2>They're all coming back right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before we get into that,</v>

142
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.333
<v Speaker 2>let's let's do something a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll give them a little hint from the </v>

143
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me something about your dad on,</v>

144
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 2>on the private side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is someone who talked about</v>

145
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily talked about himself,</v>

146
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.970
<v Speaker 2>so let's just do a little of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

147
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.030
<v Speaker 2>he was one of those comics which really </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't come to me until he died,</v>

148
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that who really did focus on,</v>

149
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean he focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked about three things,</v>

150
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 2>you focused on the little things that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>all share.</v>

151
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:21.644
<v Speaker 2>So that was the observational humor </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff in the refrigerator man and the </v>

152
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 2>airline announcements and things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

153
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 2>He focused on language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another thing that we all share</v>

154
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 2>as a culture and then he like would go </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the big subjects,</v>

155
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

156
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

157
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he never,</v>

158
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.450
<v Speaker 2>he mentioned me once in a routine in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 1971,</v>

159
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 2>one of the earlier albums where I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>very excited.</v>

160
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

161
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.580
<v Speaker 2>what's a euphemism for Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 2>we call it number two and P as number </v>
<v Speaker 2>one and how once I figured that out,</v>

163
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I made funny combinations up and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

164
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 2>And that was the only time I was ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught about.</v>

165
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.790
<v Speaker 2>And for comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 2>99 percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their material is their family and their</v>

167
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 2>personal life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

168
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.593
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad was very different than that and </v>

169
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 2>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote a memoir,</v>

170
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't publish it until we </v>
<v Speaker 2>published it.</v>

171
00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:23.390
<v Speaker 2>After he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

172
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:25.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think that was,</v>

173
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 2>was about because he's so got into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

174
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.310
<v Speaker 2>He so got into the very bit of us that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we all share.</v>

175
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.250
<v Speaker 2>And yet that part he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that respect maybe to your mom or to</v>

176
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.900
<v Speaker 2>your family or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

177
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.913
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his mind just didn't travel </v>

178
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:43.394
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His mind was out here and that's just </v>

179
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 2>the way his focus was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

180
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.533
<v Speaker 2>so it was kind of weird because I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up I would see other comedians </v>

181
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 2>about their families and it did hit me a</v>
<v Speaker 2>few times,</v>

182
00:08:58.741 --> 00:08:59.574
<v Speaker 2>especially like teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why Sydney ever talk about us on </v>

183
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:03.894
<v Speaker 2>like the tonight show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time he went on the </v>

184
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:10.071
<v Speaker 2>tonight show with Carson as the host and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carson asked about his family and he had</v>

185
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 2>these funny made up sons that he talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about dark dot Gagnon was one of them,</v>

186
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 2>which I mean it was a great bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just feel,</v>

187
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I already know I've already felt a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little invisible.</v>

188
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Therefore I felt even a little more </v>
<v Speaker 2>invisible at that time.</v>

189
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 2>And yet I think I'm happy about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wasn't,</v>

190
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:34.641
<v Speaker 2>my life wasn't fodder for his comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas my poor dad,</v>

191
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.620
<v Speaker 2>our life together has become fodder for </v>
<v Speaker 2>my art series a,</v>

192
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 2>which was a bone of contention for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

193
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:44.643
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do talk about that in the book </v>

194
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:47.390
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not so much as artists,</v>

195
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.233
<v Speaker 2>but that there were some things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had never talked about as a family that </v>

196
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 2>I really was willing to talk about on </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

197
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Like people like spalding gray and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

198
00:09:57.841 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

199
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Sandra Tsing Loh and these other solo </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists did,</v>

200
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 2>they go out and comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

202
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of comedians are way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable going on stage talking about</v>

203
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:10.524
<v Speaker 2>their life there than having to go home </v>
<v Speaker 2>and having a serious conversation with </v>

204
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:13.640
<v Speaker 2>their loved ones.</v>

205
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

206
00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:18.170
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to the sad clown thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll look to address that.</v>

207
00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:19.004
<v Speaker 1>You do address that in your one woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that was sort of a lead up to the </v>

208
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:22.574
<v Speaker 1>book that there there's a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful moment where you and your dad </v>

209
00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:25.484
<v Speaker 1>are talking and he sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like a little bit of sense of </v>

210
00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:32.351
<v Speaker 1>betrayal or a sense that he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be exposed in a way that he had an done</v>

211
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.093
<v Speaker 2>and I think ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what happened was I wrote a solo </v>

212
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:36.644
<v Speaker 2>show and I sent him the script and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the script I talked about having </v>

213
00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:42.824
<v Speaker 2>some feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some negative feelings about when my </v>

214
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:44.894
<v Speaker 2>mother was dying and he had to go on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>road and it was a conversation my dad </v>

215
00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:48.224
<v Speaker 2>and I had never had and we didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any real healthy conversation closure </v>

216
00:10:51.831 --> 00:10:53.420
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

217
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.261
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

218
00:10:54.261 --> 00:10:55.094
<v Speaker 2>looking back on it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think sending him that script was my </v>

219
00:10:57.411 --> 00:10:59.630
<v Speaker 2>way of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

220
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:00.763
<v Speaker 2>I have these feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this was one of the themes I wanted </v>

221
00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:08.120
<v Speaker 2>to work on in the book was that here's </v>
<v Speaker 2>this man who is the truth teller.</v>

222
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you said at opening of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

223
00:11:10.221 --> 00:11:11.054
<v Speaker 2>this is the man who conquered everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>was fearless and we'll talk about all </v>

224
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:17.240
<v Speaker 2>the big stuff that our culture does not </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to talk about on stage.</v>

225
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.800
<v Speaker 2>And yet when it came to our family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were very much the textbook,</v>

226
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:26.890
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional alcoholic family that did </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of walking on eggshells,</v>

227
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.033
<v Speaker 2>didn't do a lot of intimate talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the issues and we all pretended </v>

228
00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:34.230
<v Speaker 2>that we were fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

229
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.980
<v Speaker 2>we all worked for the American family </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly.</v>

230
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:37.814
<v Speaker 2>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's like when people talk about </v>

231
00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:40.080
<v Speaker 2>my book and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

232
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.450
<v Speaker 2>you have such a unique life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

233
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

234
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.253
<v Speaker 2>I mean I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but kind of like the all American </v>

235
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.520
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

236
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.040
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to delve too deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want people.</v>

237
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I want people to buy the books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

238
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:51.920
<v Speaker 1>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an important piece of this.</v>

239
00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 1>But just one more thing on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

240
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.250
<v Speaker 1>did you have a sense when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up,</v>

241
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad,</v>

242
00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.811
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

243
00:11:58.811 --> 00:11:59.644
<v Speaker 1>there were drug things that you talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in the book and in the show </v>

244
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 1>arrests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:03.994
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was arrested that night that Lenny </v>

246
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.941
<v Speaker 1>Bruce was arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

247
00:12:05.941 --> 00:12:06.701
<v Speaker 1>And is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

248
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:07.534
<v Speaker 1>that was before I was born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these types of things that were </v>

249
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.810
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on the front lines.</v>

250
00:12:11.811 --> 00:12:14.710
<v Speaker 1>So how much of that do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you conscious,</v>

251
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 1>especially in your early years that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad really was this,</v>

252
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 1>this legend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

253
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:20.884
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's the Mount Rushmore of </v>

254
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:22.234
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

255
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half the people say it's your dad.</v>

256
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.873
<v Speaker 1>Half the people say it's prior and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's one percent that gets </v>

257
00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:28.740
<v Speaker 1>split amongst lenny bruce and a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years,</v>

258
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.540
<v Speaker 2>the legend kind of route mount rushmore </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing really happened more when I was in</v>

259
00:12:35.641 --> 00:12:37.740
<v Speaker 2>my twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

260
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I was at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

261
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an English class at Ucla and my </v>

262
00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:43.320
<v Speaker 2>professor says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:46.470
<v Speaker 2>we're going to study a compare and </v>
<v Speaker 2>contrast essays today.</v>

264
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.740
<v Speaker 2>And I have a perfect example of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of how you should go about this,</v>

265
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.880
<v Speaker 2>and he pushes the play button on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boombox and my dad's baseball,</v>

266
00:12:53.881 --> 00:12:54.714
<v Speaker 2>football routine comes out and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there in this class of like 25 </v>

267
00:12:57.661 --> 00:13:00.360
<v Speaker 2>people looking around going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

268
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.650
<v Speaker 2>is anyone else</v>

269
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.483
<v Speaker 1>having this weird experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to play any shit from </v>

270
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.090
<v Speaker 1>anyone else's dad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's when you realize,</v>

271
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.073
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big dent in the culture has happened </v>

272
00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:14.400
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

273
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.050
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

274
00:13:16.051 --> 00:13:18.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it was from that point on that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew like legend,</v>

275
00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:19.704
<v Speaker 2>but even before that I knew that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously famous and people worshiped </v>

276
00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:24.114
<v Speaker 2>him and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that kind of stuff and was </v>

277
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:27.090
<v Speaker 2>around for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.380
<v Speaker 2>an arrest or two of his also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I knew he was definitely on the front</v>

279
00:13:31.381 --> 00:13:32.280
<v Speaker 2>lines of something.</v>

280
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.280
<v Speaker 1>So let's get into some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the themes that,</v>

281
00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:36.410
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have become the central themes of,</v>

282
00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:38.350
<v Speaker 1>of what I'm trying to do here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>

283
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say to you all the time,</v>

284
00:13:39.501 --> 00:13:40.334
<v Speaker 1>as I said in the Intro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching the news constantly and I </v>

285
00:13:43.371 --> 00:13:45.980
<v Speaker 1>like either text you sometimes or I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>call you and be like,</v>

286
00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.390
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish your dad was around because.</v>

287
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Because I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can certainly.</v>

288
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.240
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know anyone else that can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can skewer stuff in that way.</v>

289
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.490
<v Speaker 1>So let's just hit a couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the religion one,</v>

290
00:13:55.491 --> 00:13:58.760
<v Speaker 1>so you already mentioned a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about his history with religion.</v>

291
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he an atheist?</v>

292
00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Did he describe himself in any specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>

293
00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:04.634
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

294
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.593
<v Speaker 2>He did not use the term atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He felt atheism was as dogmatic as any </v>

295
00:14:11.061 --> 00:14:14.270
<v Speaker 2>other ism out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

296
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:14:16.401 --> 00:14:20.390
<v Speaker 2>lately I've been introduced to what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>call the humanist,</v>

298
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:21.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

299
00:14:21.771 --> 00:14:22.604
<v Speaker 2>kind of community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something I relate to a lot </v>

300
00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:25.394
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he would have felt better about </v>

301
00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:28.250
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like they're not going to have</v>

302
00:14:28.251 --> 00:14:30.530
<v Speaker 2>as many meetings and armbands and things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

303
00:14:30.531 --> 00:14:33.050
<v Speaker 2>which you used to talk about groups </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's things less koolaid.</v>

304
00:14:33.051 --> 00:14:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I think he felt any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

305
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.653
<v Speaker 2>any group of people you get group think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then where does the individual </v>

306
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.410
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

307
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.520
<v Speaker 2>happen in that situation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that always worried him.</v>

308
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's self,</v>

309
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>named himself mostly as an agnostic.</v>

310
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:50.563
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously didn't believe in the man in </v>

311
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:53.234
<v Speaker 2>the sky with the beard thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he was thinking of that </v>

312
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:56.054
<v Speaker 2>was a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had a deep sense of oneness with </v>

313
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:00.710
<v Speaker 2>the universe.</v>

314
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:05.370
<v Speaker 2>He loved astronomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loved that idea of looking up and um,</v>

315
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling you get when you look at me</v>

316
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:08.571
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

317
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:09.404
<v Speaker 2>we're just a speck here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet there's something about that </v>

318
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 2>being a Spec that expands us at the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

319
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:18.180
<v Speaker 2>So there was something around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

320
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:19.723
<v Speaker 2>he was a man who dropped acid in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties and had some transcendent </v>

321
00:15:22.971 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 2>experiences about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And talk to me about,</v>

322
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a high and having an experience </v>

323
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:35.660
<v Speaker 2>where he realized that he really was at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one with everything,</v>

324
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.913
<v Speaker 2>including the old tennis shoe in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gutter and that he realized that if he </v>

325
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:41.594
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything was him and he was </v>

326
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:45.524
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from that moment on he said he felt </v>

327
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 2>safe because he knew that no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he encountered in life,</v>

328
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.020
<v Speaker 2>he was only encountering a version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

329
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.320
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty spiritual stuff.</v>

330
00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:58.551
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

331
00:15:58.551 --> 00:16:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can put it under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that box spiritual.</v>

332
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could,</v>

333
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.140
<v Speaker 2>you could talk about it from a brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>science way and say,</v>

334
00:16:06.141 --> 00:16:06.974
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's things in the brain that </v>

335
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:09.650
<v Speaker 2>makes us feel that way or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

336
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.083
<v Speaker 2>But it is an experience that changes </v>
<v Speaker 2>your world view and changes how you </v>

337
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.480
<v Speaker 2>encounter your life and other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

338
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:19.040
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that did that for him.</v>

339
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you think a lot of his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of.</v>

340
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Because when I think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of this sort of anti religion,</v>

341
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.530
<v Speaker 2>the rants that he would go on at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>church and religion.</v>

342
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 2>And how much of it was just not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>about religion specifically,</v>

343
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:35.990
<v Speaker 2>but just about authoritarianism or was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really what it was about?</v>

344
00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:37.430
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

345
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:38.264
<v Speaker 2>I can't say I won't speak for him and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really know at all what motivated </v>

346
00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:42.170
<v Speaker 2>him to do those bits.</v>

347
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.470
<v Speaker 2>I never was privy to that part of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

348
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:46.443
<v Speaker 2>How he would sit me down during the Hbo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Taping and let me see it just the way </v>

349
00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 2>everyone else saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never knew his process,</v>

350
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Speaker 2>but sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

351
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.943
<v Speaker 2>I think if you looked at all of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>material and and sifted through it and </v>

352
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.850
<v Speaker 2>analyzed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think authoritarian is.</v>

353
00:17:00.851 --> 00:17:05.030
<v Speaker 2>It would be a huge aspect to it all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone out.</v>

354
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:05.864
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad never made it through a single </v>

355
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:11.150
<v Speaker 2>institution encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got kicked out of everything.</v>

356
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Elementary School,</v>
<v Speaker 2>junior high,</v>

357
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.090
<v Speaker 2>high school did not finish high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninth Grade Dropout.</v>

358
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Then joined the air force early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoted and demoted.</v>

359
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.843
<v Speaker 2>I got a little piece of paper of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has all the listings of the </v>

360
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 2>promotions and the emotions that he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the air force.</v>

361
00:17:28.461 --> 00:17:31.490
<v Speaker 2>So he got kicked out of that and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately,</v>

362
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:34.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>became this straight suit,</v>

363
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.400
<v Speaker 2>clean cut comic and even that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative form that he had to be in,</v>

364
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:43.580
<v Speaker 2>in order to be a successful comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because his dream is to be in the movies</v>

365
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:46.640
<v Speaker 2>eventually that felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:47.474
<v Speaker 2>too restrictive and authoritarian for </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and he rebelled against that to </v>

367
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 2>ultimately he was always looking.</v>

368
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked about the line.</v>

369
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:55.220
<v Speaker 2>He always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

370
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.050
<v Speaker 2>a comics job is to find the line and </v>
<v Speaker 2>across it.</v>

371
00:17:58.051 --> 00:17:58.884
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what that's about is </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone telling you you can't do </v>

372
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

373
00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 2>let's cross it and really see what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do on the other side of that.</v>

374
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.253
<v Speaker 2>So let's just back up for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you mentioned that at one time </v>

375
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 2>your dad was this sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't conservative comic,</v>

376
00:18:13.591 --> 00:18:15.320
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was buttoned down,</v>

377
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.183
<v Speaker 2>get kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was sort of like everyone else in </v>

378
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.250
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was that generic,</v>

379
00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:21.084
<v Speaker 2>whatever that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then had a moment that it all </v>

380
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.630
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

381
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.150
<v Speaker 2>do you know what it was personally at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that moment or was it purely like lsd?</v>

382
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.771
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

383
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:29.580
<v Speaker 2>it was the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

384
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was already the other person.</v>

385
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.310
<v Speaker 2>He had been smoking weed since he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>14.</v>

386
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.070
<v Speaker 2>His politics were a little more </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative growing up.</v>

387
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:40.300
<v Speaker 2>His mom was a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

388
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.860
<v Speaker 2>whatever they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snow,</v>

389
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 2>anything anymore rela relative to fiscal</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what every school.</v>

390
00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives central liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

391
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

392
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.043
<v Speaker 2>and when he met Jack Burns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his first thing was he was a comedy duo </v>

393
00:18:54.061 --> 00:18:54.894
<v Speaker 2>with Jack Burns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack Burns was left progressive and my </v>

394
00:18:57.811 --> 00:18:58.644
<v Speaker 2>dad was more moderate guy and Jack took </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and pulled him and taught him about </v>

395
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.040
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course Lenny Bruce,</v>

396
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blew his mind too.</v>

397
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.580
<v Speaker 2>So on the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad was a radical.</v>

398
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.750
<v Speaker 2>He was hanging out with musicians in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>village,</v>

399
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

400
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.813
<v Speaker 2>he was one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had to put on this exterior in </v>

401
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:24.660
<v Speaker 2>order to build this career because in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his mind he really did.</v>

402
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.553
<v Speaker 2>He had this Danny k plan and he wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like Danny Kaye in the movies and </v>

403
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Speaker 2>he felt the way to do that was tv and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these night clubs.</v>

404
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were no comedy clubs back then.</v>

405
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.190
<v Speaker 2>You were doing the playboy club with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Copa Cabana and you were opening for,</v>

406
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God knows four seasons was.</v>

407
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:42.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

408
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he were lucky.</v>

409
00:19:43.591 --> 00:19:44.880
<v Speaker 2>It was a foreseeable bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humperdink.</v>

410
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he opened for the supremes and </v>

411
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Las Vegas and 69,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

412
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:50.730
<v Speaker 2>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

413
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:51.564
<v Speaker 2>some really think how crazy that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can say it and we don't really </v>

414
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 2>absorb what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your dad.</v>

415
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even before his transformation opening.</v>

416
00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supremes.</v>

417
00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:00.650
<v Speaker 2>It seems so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

418
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was a,</v>

419
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:02.483
<v Speaker 2>that was a great gig for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was making a lot of money in that </v>

420
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:05.004
<v Speaker 2>Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you tell a story where he </v>

421
00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:08.160
<v Speaker 2>actually got fired from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got fired for that Gig.</v>

422
00:20:08.161 --> 00:20:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

423
00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 2>He was making more money than he ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>had made.</v>

424
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.550
<v Speaker 2>And he said the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

425
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.940
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His ass in that one or shit,</v>

426
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I think you said Shit that he got fired </v>
<v Speaker 2>twice in Vegas after shit.</v>

427
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Her Shit and Redd Foxx is down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street doing triple x stuff of course.</v>

428
00:20:21.661 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

429
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.243
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this was the thing he realized he </v>

430
00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:30.471
<v Speaker 2>was entertaining the parents of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that he was hanging out with and,</v>

431
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.043
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's like another part of his </v>

432
00:20:33.991 --> 00:20:38.820
<v Speaker 2>outsider status to was he was 30 in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1967,</v>

433
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.390
<v Speaker 2>so he was already too old for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hippies and all the kids that were going</v>

434
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:46.890
<v Speaker 2>through that because they were all early</v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties,</v>

435
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 2>but he wasn't relating to their parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

436
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.140
<v Speaker 2>So he was this interesting bridge </v>
<v Speaker 2>between those two generations,</v>

437
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 2>but related obviously much more to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger generation.</v>

438
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.123
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk a little bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about language because we've been doing </v>

439
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:01.594
<v Speaker 1>a ton on political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Dad was not only the most </v>

440
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 1>unpolitically correct person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

441
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:08.740
<v Speaker 1>but hated it with a passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

442
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:09.643
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really hated it and used words in a </v>

443
00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:15.640
<v Speaker 1>way to show us how silly we are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>about things all the time.</v>

444
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think right now we're in this very</v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre place in our country where we're</v>

445
00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:23.050
<v Speaker 1>afraid of certain words were afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>offending people.</v>

446
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.320
<v Speaker 1>You talked about the line before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing the limits and like jumping over</v>

447
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:27.154
<v Speaker 1>the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think he would make of </v>

448
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in this country right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now with,</v>

449
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.950
<v Speaker 1>with words?</v>

450
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about that.</v>

451
00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I think he would make what he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's always made it.</v>

452
00:21:36.711 --> 00:21:37.544
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early nineties this was going on </v>

453
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:43.710
<v Speaker 2>in colleges too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at Ucla and actually did a,</v>

454
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 2>a forum on political correctness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>invited my dad to come in and do that.</v>

455
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:51.940
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was coming out of the Reagan era,</v>

456
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was a lot of that.</v>

457
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.633
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you really think about it like </v>

458
00:21:55.361 --> 00:21:56.194
<v Speaker 2>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about like polite </v>

459
00:21:57.491 --> 00:21:58.324
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're not allowed to talk about </v>

460
00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 2>certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I think it kind of grows out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

462
00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:04.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for him,</v>

463
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.393
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was always bothered by the fact that </v>

464
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.060
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

465
00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes from a place of people wanting,</v>

466
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect for tolerance,</v>

467
00:22:17.141 --> 00:22:17.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

468
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.600
<v Speaker 2>of each other and our identities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of well intentioned.</v>

469
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.160
<v Speaker 2>It's very well intentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my dad grew up in Harlem,</v>

470
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.430
<v Speaker 2>but he grew up in Harlem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Irish,</v>

471
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.220
<v Speaker 2>White Harlem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right next to black and Spanish Harlem.</v>

472
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would've called it Black Harlem.</v>

473
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.170
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't make him race.</v>

474
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.290
<v Speaker 2>It does not make him racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

475
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:47.170
<v Speaker 2>and so he very much identified with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>black experience,</v>

476
00:22:47.171 --> 00:22:50.050
<v Speaker 2>the outsider experience and growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

477
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 2>the n word was never ever said in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

478
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.050
<v Speaker 2>And my dad told me it is the one word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

479
00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.420
<v Speaker 2>I was allowed to say any of the words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say all seven for TV,</v>

480
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.220
<v Speaker 2>but say them in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in right the right places.</v>

481
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:05.980
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want me getting in trouble at </v>
<v Speaker 2>school and other people's houses,</v>

482
00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:08.770
<v Speaker 2>but the n word was one where that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kelly never,</v>

483
00:23:08.771 --> 00:23:09.604
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

484
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.713
<v Speaker 2>So he got the whole idea of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to define themselves and having </v>

485
00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:16.240
<v Speaker 2>their own identity.</v>

486
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.073
<v Speaker 2>That's a very important thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an important part of </v>

487
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:20.134
<v Speaker 2>evolution of our species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you do it by not tolerating </v>

488
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 2>other speech and suppressing language </v>
<v Speaker 2>and speech,</v>

489
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he believed that that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>not the route to go about this,</v>

490
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:34.811
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

491
00:23:34.811 --> 00:23:39.811
<v Speaker 2>using intolerance to increase tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just some to something it just made,</v>

492
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.030
<v Speaker 2>does it fit or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

493
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.823
<v Speaker 2>and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing about speech and our </v>

494
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:46.641
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

495
00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:49.070
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anyone's under the first amendment,</v>

496
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.460
<v Speaker 2>it's always that old thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

497
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.303
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always a balance between two </v>

498
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.060
<v Speaker 2>forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

499
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 2>And so here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

500
00:23:57.381 --> 00:24:01.460
<v Speaker 2>it's about freedom versus sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both things are important,</v>

501
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.890
<v Speaker 2>really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

502
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.933
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't throw the baby out with the </v>

503
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:06.921
<v Speaker 2>bathwater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

504
00:24:06.921 --> 00:24:07.754
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that freedom is a little </v>

505
00:24:08.631 --> 00:24:11.050
<v Speaker 2>more important than sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

506
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.013
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you it is for some other people it </v>

507
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:13.850
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

508
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 2>but this is the great thing about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy is,</v>

509
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:17.653
<v Speaker 2>and the way we work this stuff out is by</v>
<v Speaker 2>having free speech and a marketplace of </v>

510
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:23.450
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So therefore,</v>

511
00:24:23.451 --> 00:24:26.030
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to control people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

512
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:26.893
<v Speaker 2>then are you really having a marketplace</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ideas and we're not talking about </v>

513
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:30.554
<v Speaker 2>people bullying people and insult comics</v>
<v Speaker 2>and comics who want to hurt feelings or </v>

514
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:37.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

515
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.710
<v Speaker 2>the whole rape thing that went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

516
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.940
<v Speaker 2>there is obviously we're not talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about hate speech,</v>

517
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.740
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

518
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.090
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

519
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:51.740
<v Speaker 2>my dad did talk about is that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup comedy is a monologue.</v>

520
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an art form that it's a monologue.</v>

521
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.540
<v Speaker 2>It was his bully pulpit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to say,</v>

522
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:00.374
<v Speaker 2>the Adi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for me and the audiences here </v>

523
00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't here for them.</v>

524
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Speaker 2>He's not there to do a seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's not.</v>

525
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.813
<v Speaker 2>Even though he was professed sorial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not there to change the world in </v>

526
00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:11.774
<v Speaker 2>some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was there to get shit off of his </v>

527
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:14.684
<v Speaker 2>chest and he did it in a certain way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would love to know his new take on </v>

528
00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:21.740
<v Speaker 2>all this college stuff and all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff going down,</v>

529
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.813
<v Speaker 2>but I think it would be built on a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this stuff right now with this whole </v>

530
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:25.874
<v Speaker 2>thing we have on college campuses with </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors and safe rooms </v>

531
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 2>and trigger warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things we've talked about.</v>

532
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.323
<v Speaker 2>You wrote an interesting piece about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this on your facebook page that was </v>

533
00:25:34.641 --> 00:25:35.474
<v Speaker 2>related to comedy and all of this and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit it was sort of about your </v>

534
00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:39.164
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we jumped off because of Jerry </v>

535
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:41.370
<v Speaker 2>seinfeld making a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

536
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.150
<v Speaker 2>And Todd and todd glass had written a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

537
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 2>a reply to a piece in the La Times and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he felt,</v>

538
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was kind of on the other side of it,</v>

539
00:25:48.441 --> 00:25:53.441
<v Speaker 2>of respecting people's rights to define </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves more and you know,</v>

540
00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:55.130
<v Speaker 2>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of.</v>

541
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.530
<v Speaker 2>I'd finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I think,</v>

542
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a year and a half or two years of </v>

543
00:25:57.951 --> 00:26:01.340
<v Speaker 2>trying to think about all this had </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled all my thoughts together and,</v>

544
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:01.960
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

545
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.240
<v Speaker 2>and some of it I've already shared here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the whole trigger warning thing,</v>

546
00:26:05.241 --> 00:26:10.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean I really would have loved my dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>to unpack the,</v>

547
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.593
<v Speaker 2>just the phrase trigger just to help us </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpack it a little bit and I can only </v>

548
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:20.054
<v Speaker 2>imagine who he would have pissed off </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that I'm sure it would have been </v>

549
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:26.350
<v Speaker 2>the feminists and my dad was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered himself a feminist.</v>

550
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:27.343
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

551
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:28.940
<v Speaker 2>that was the irony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

552
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:31.010
<v Speaker 2>So something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have pissed off the feminists,</v>

553
00:26:31.011 --> 00:26:33.060
<v Speaker 2>but he was very pro woman actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

554
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.390
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was To empower women who've never.</v>

555
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:36.880
<v Speaker 2>He would really talk about something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

556
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.250
<v Speaker 2>His humor for the most part I would say </v>
<v Speaker 2>is very pro woman.</v>

557
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.960
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

558
00:26:41.961 --> 00:26:44.580
<v Speaker 2>even when he talked about using the term</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape,</v>

559
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it can rape ever be funny.</v>

560
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:50.040
<v Speaker 2>And then he tells this joke about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

561
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:50.993
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>donald or daffy duck fucking elmer fudd </v>

562
00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:54.580

563
00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a great image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't help but laugh.</v>

564
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's gay duck rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

565
00:27:00.271 --> 00:27:02.140
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I've got the vegans.</v>

566
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the game.</v>

567
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please trigger warning on that.</v>

568
00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.030
<v Speaker 2>That joke right there please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

569
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

570
00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I miss him too.</v>

574
00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 2>There are certain things that come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I,</v>

575
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.000
<v Speaker 2>where I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

576
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.060
<v Speaker 2>I wish dad was here and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

577
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:24.240
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to have to figure this </v>
<v Speaker 2>out on my own or on her own like without</v>

578
00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:26.190
<v Speaker 2>dad how to walk through this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

579
00:27:26.191 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 2>and there's some comics out there who I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think definitely helped with this.</v>

580
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The work is helping.</v>

581
00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 2>I was going to ask you that a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>closer to the end,</v>

582
00:27:34.081 --> 00:27:37.640
<v Speaker 2>but as long as I think Bill Maher is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Lewis Black is a,</v>

583
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I think Louis Ck is doing brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

584
00:27:40.351 --> 00:27:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I think Amy Schumer is doing great work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Nora Dunn.</v>

585
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Just went after her today and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's talking about using,</v>

586
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 2>naming her body parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using nasty words to name her body parts</v>

587
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:53.454
<v Speaker 2>and she thinks it's self shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's gonna be an interesting </v>

588
00:27:55.561 --> 00:27:58.350
<v Speaker 2>conversation between the feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on with that?</v>

589
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

590
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:00.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

591
00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:04.740
<v Speaker 2>and there's a ton of younger comics too </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are doing great work.</v>

592
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not that Amy Schumer isn't 1:30</v>

593
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 2>or so young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

594
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

595
00:28:12.091 --> 00:28:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

596
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.630
<v Speaker 2>there's good work going on at there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Rock,</v>

597
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always does great work.</v>

598
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.290
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

599
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're out there pushing,</v>

600
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 2>pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing the edge,</v>

601
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.480
<v Speaker 2>but the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should be.</v>

602
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.393
<v Speaker 2>So last thought on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the free speech and the political </v>

603
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.330
<v Speaker 2>correctness stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

604
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:29.203
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this where we could really teach </v>

605
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:35.300
<v Speaker 2>younger people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I hate to say that as if.</v>

606
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's an arrogance in that too.</v>

607
00:28:37.921 --> 00:28:38.754
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think generations come up and they've </v>

608
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 2>got their own worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got their own life experience.</v>

609
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:45.890
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to define themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

610
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.243
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they weren't around for the </v>

611
00:28:49.891 --> 00:28:50.724
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't around for Lenny Bruce </v>

612
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:52.973
<v Speaker 2>Getting arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't around for my dad getting </v>

613
00:28:54.511 --> 00:28:57.360
<v Speaker 2>arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand the luxury.</v>

614
00:28:57.361 --> 00:29:02.361
<v Speaker 2>They have a around free speech and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this regressive left.</v>

615
00:29:04.231 --> 00:29:05.700
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's what we're calling them </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

616
00:29:05.701 --> 00:29:06.980
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw one of your path,</v>

617
00:29:06.981 --> 00:29:08.630
<v Speaker 2>what I'm calling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to look it up.</v>

618
00:29:08.631 --> 00:29:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly does he mean by that?</v>

619
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:11.970
<v Speaker 2>Now I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand it.</v>

620
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.283
<v Speaker 2>And it's these people that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking your dad with the kids and </v>

621
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.840
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an authoritarianism around it.</v>

622
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 2>There's a need to control everything in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order for the world to be comfortable.</v>

623
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.230
<v Speaker 2>And Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

624
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.213
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That generation is facing a planet </v>

625
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Speaker 2>that's dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

626
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.020
<v Speaker 2>an economy that doesn't look very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics that have stopped working,</v>

627
00:29:36.031 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 2>our democracy has stopped working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

628
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I too would want to control things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe if you can control people's</v>

629
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:45.670
<v Speaker 2>language and create a sense of safety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

630
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:48.190
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's what this is about on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological level.</v>

631
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

632
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:50.681
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>

633
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:51.514
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is our job to at least bring </v>

634
00:29:54.971 --> 00:29:55.804
<v Speaker 2>some history up and educate them about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fights we've had in this country to </v>

635
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:01.384
<v Speaker 2>end to understand what the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speeches and it's not like enter </v>

636
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 2>government is no longer censoring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

637
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.013
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now corporate America and these </v>

638
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:11.530
<v Speaker 2>interest groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

639
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.423
<v Speaker 2>So did you ever think or or someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your father literally arrested by </v>

640
00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 2>because of exercising his free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is someone who last gigs because of</v>

641
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:24.730
<v Speaker 2>using pretty mundane curse words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he could have ever imagined</v>

642
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.590
<v Speaker 2>if you would agree with what you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

643
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.750
<v Speaker 2>that you would fear the lack of free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech?</v>

644
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Not because the government is coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

645
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.530
<v Speaker 2>which is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing it to ourselves.</v>

646
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he could have ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>envisioned,</v>

647
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.253
<v Speaker 2>envisioned?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a lot to say about business and </v>

648
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 2>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he really hated all of them.</v>

649
00:30:40.211 --> 00:30:41.044
<v Speaker 2>They are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are the owners of this country and </v>

650
00:30:42.641 --> 00:30:46.810
<v Speaker 2>have been ever since the industrial age </v>
<v Speaker 2>began.</v>

651
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.800
<v Speaker 2>What was that bit and his last Hbo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Special About The true owners?</v>

652
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the second to last one.</v>

653
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

654
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

655
00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean he would have a lot to say about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and he,</v>

656
00:30:58.661 --> 00:30:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like,</v>

657
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:03.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago corporations weren't trying</v>

658
00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:06.310
<v Speaker 2>to shave him at advertising dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape everything on television.</v>

659
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now with the Internet,</v>

660
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.390
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because we have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>more freedom,</v>

661
00:31:10.391 --> 00:31:11.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

662
00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

663
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I look at like the bigger picture </v>

664
00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:13.744
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think of like the expansion of </v>

665
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:16.480
<v Speaker 2>the freedom that the Internet has given </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

666
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.553
<v Speaker 2>So it's not strange that some other part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our culture wants to shut something </v>

667
00:31:21.251 --> 00:31:21.881
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

668
00:31:21.881 --> 00:31:22.714
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a balance like this all the </v>

669
00:31:26.591 --> 00:31:27.280
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

670
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 2>whether it's in our own individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>psyches are the collective psyche.</v>

671
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:33.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately,</v>

672
00:31:33.341 --> 00:31:35.260
<v Speaker 2>you know what I tell people when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

673
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your dad,</v>

674
00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I wish you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

675
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:39.160
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

676
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.290
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm going to try not to say to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

677
00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:42.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true and I.</v>

678
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:43.900
<v Speaker 2>But I remind people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

679
00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:44.770
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>

680
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:48.100
<v Speaker 2>we can remember this dad said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're born,</v>

681
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.090
<v Speaker 2>you get a ticket to the freak show and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're born in America,</v>

682
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you get a front row seat.</v>

683
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.143
<v Speaker 2>So we're at the freak show and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>added later on another thing which I </v>

684
00:31:58.931 --> 00:31:59.561
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

685
00:31:59.561 --> 00:32:03.400
<v Speaker 2>and some of us get to sit on the side </v>
<v Speaker 2>and take notes and talk about it,</v>

686
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 2>which is what we get to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

687
00:32:05.741 --> 00:32:07.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a really privileged position to</v>

688
00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:08.870
<v Speaker 2>be in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

689
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:09.743
<v Speaker 2>but now everyone gets that privileged </v>
<v Speaker 2>position because it's the internet and </v>

690
00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:13.130
<v Speaker 2>there's comments sector going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

691
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty good to me.</v>

692
00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.040
<v Speaker 2>They're the people watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

693
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:22.210
<v Speaker 2>We've cultivated something nice here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the political situation we have going</v>

694
00:32:22.211 --> 00:32:23.044
<v Speaker 2>on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this pathetic really pathetic group of </v>

695
00:32:26.531 --> 00:32:28.390
<v Speaker 2>candidates are pretty much on all </v>
<v Speaker 2>fronts,</v>

696
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.120
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Bernie being the one exception.</v>

697
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

698
00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.373
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think he would make of this </v>

699
00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:34.790
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

700
00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:35.623
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

701
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 2>he obviously was socially liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't identify as a Democrat,</v>

702
00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:41.054
<v Speaker 2>did he?</v>

703
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.040
<v Speaker 2>He didn't vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't vote at all,</v>

704
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.160
<v Speaker 2>but he was very progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He always chose people over property.</v>

705
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:47.710
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

706
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.120
<v Speaker 2>whatever candidate chose people over </v>
<v Speaker 2>property,</v>

707
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.880
<v Speaker 2>he would lean towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

708
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 2>before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was happy about Hillary back in 2008.</v>

709
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.253
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not around for the big Obama </v>

710
00:32:59.201 --> 00:33:02.840
<v Speaker 2>surge and I know he would have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrilled to have seen a black president.</v>

711
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I know he would have really been </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrilled about that.</v>

712
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:05.474
<v Speaker 2>And I got to be in Washington and </v>
<v Speaker 2>November picking up his Mark Twain </v>

713
00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Prize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Obama flew over,</v>

714
00:33:11.391 --> 00:33:12.224
<v Speaker 2>my husband and I were on the steps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Lincoln memorial and Obama was flew </v>

715
00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:16.364
<v Speaker 2>over in the helicopter to go visit </v>
<v Speaker 2>George Bush in the White House for the </v>

716
00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 2>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all I could think about is,</v>

717
00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I wish my dad was here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have brought a tear to his eye.</v>

718
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:24.343
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a very sentimental man in that </v>

719
00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

720
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:27.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

721
00:33:27.801 --> 00:33:32.030
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he saw it all as bullshit as he said</v>

722
00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really had a detachment to it.</v>

723
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:35.264
<v Speaker 2>He didn't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hadn't voted since mcgovern lost in </v>

724
00:33:37.321 --> 00:33:38.154
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 72.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's when his heart really </v>

725
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:40.190
<v Speaker 2>broke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

726
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:44.210
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I struggle with that internally,</v>

727
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.110
<v Speaker 2>that he wasn't voting yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was talking so much about this,</v>

728
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:50.920
<v Speaker 2>but he also felt the system was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>broken almost that it was he would it be</v>

729
00:33:50.921 --> 00:33:54.530
<v Speaker 2>on repairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logic was that you,</v>

730
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.393
<v Speaker 2>if you vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the right to complain if </v>

731
00:33:58.171 --> 00:33:58.540
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

732
00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.373
<v Speaker 3>both.</v>

733
00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:01.203
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's talk about flipping something on </v>

734
00:34:01.881 --> 00:34:04.640
<v Speaker 2>a test because then you're part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

735
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

736
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 2>That was his thing and he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd said that a few times.</v>

737
00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:11.690
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

738
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.750
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was his stance.</v>

739
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:15.973
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where he stood with that and </v>

740
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:18.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really did.</v>

741
00:34:18.201 --> 00:34:20.480
<v Speaker 2>He was able to compartmentalize and </v>
<v Speaker 2>detach,</v>

742
00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.980
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at home,</v>

743
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 2>rooting for Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy that,</v>

744
00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:24.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she was,</v>

745
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:25.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaking things up,</v>

746
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.930
<v Speaker 2>but on stage he didn't need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would never talk about,</v>

747
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one way or the other.</v>

748
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean like Lewis Black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

749
00:34:33.681 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 2>his politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know who he's voting for.</v>

750
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gives money,</v>

751
00:34:37.611 --> 00:34:40.910
<v Speaker 2>like he's tried to get money to burn </v>
<v Speaker 2>money to Bernie on Friday.</v>

752
00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:42.250
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to give you money.</v>

753
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I can only give you $5,400.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not taking any super PAC money,</v>

754
00:34:46.101 --> 00:34:46.934
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a pre,</v>

755
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:48.290
<v Speaker 2>you give him another million dollars.</v>

756
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.143
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Maher literally gave and Obama </v>

757
00:34:50.751 --> 00:34:51.584
<v Speaker 2>super a million dollars budget and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was sort of brilliant what he said </v>

758
00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 2>because he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

759
00:34:55.221 --> 00:34:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I know this sounds like I'm doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Obama,</v>

760
00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:57.853
<v Speaker 2>but I'm doing this for me because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want the other guy to become </v>

761
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.533
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he was saying Friday </v>

762
00:35:01.251 --> 00:35:01.941
<v Speaker 2>night too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

763
00:35:01.941 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't like the fish,</v>

764
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:05.060
<v Speaker 2>eat the chicken people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think as a comic,</v>

765
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:07.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a risk in that because then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've shown your cards too much in that</v>

766
00:35:07.611 --> 00:35:11.870
<v Speaker 2>what your dad did and in a way by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by holding a little closer.</v>

767
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I think every comic has their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>

768
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.193
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as you know that we're all </v>

769
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:17.420
<v Speaker 2>snowflakes.</v>

770
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

771
00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's got their own approach to it </v>

772
00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:26.050
<v Speaker 2>in their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad liked being,</v>

773
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.540
<v Speaker 2>not part of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He liked not being,</v>

774
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:31.270
<v Speaker 2>having no stake in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

775
00:35:31.271 --> 00:35:33.310
<v Speaker 2>so that he could emotionally detached </v>
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>

776
00:35:33.311 --> 00:35:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I think that's how he personally </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected himself from all of it to um,</v>

777
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I personally don't think that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy way to go through life.</v>

778
00:35:40.241 --> 00:35:42.700
<v Speaker 2>I love my dad dearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

779
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad was like,</v>

780
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:44.754
<v Speaker 2>I gave about the species I gave up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet and I was in my late </v>

781
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:48.684
<v Speaker 2>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early forties at the time and I was </v>

782
00:35:49.471 --> 00:35:50.730
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well gee,</v>

783
00:35:50.731 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I hope to have 30 to 40 more years on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>

784
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm still kind of involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>species a little more and I get the,</v>

785
00:35:58.051 --> 00:35:59.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution is slow,</v>

786
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:02.340
<v Speaker 2>but I do believe in the evolution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

787
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I try to do my little part.</v>

788
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 2>My Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was never an activist.</v>

789
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:07.824
<v Speaker 2>He was never on the front lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the Vietnam War and all that </v>

790
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:12.150
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning had opinions about it,</v>

791
00:36:12.151 --> 00:36:16.920
<v Speaker 2>but he's not a man who got involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He onstage did his act,</v>

792
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:17.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>activism and there's probably something </v>

793
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:21.150
<v Speaker 2>to be said for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we all in life,</v>

794
00:36:21.151 --> 00:36:21.984
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not just talking about comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody sort of picks very little </v>

795
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:25.284
<v Speaker 2>role about how they're going to go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some people are gonna have kids and </v>

796
00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:30.204
<v Speaker 2>try to teach them the right thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like your dad will have one </v>

797
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:33.300
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>

798
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.540
<v Speaker 2>but then teach a generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although he claimed he never.</v>

799
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Although it's not about changing minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

800
00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

801
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.620
<v Speaker 2>when I used to say please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bullshit dad,</v>

802
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

803
00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he changed me.</v>

804
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:46.410
<v Speaker 2>He was surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

805
00:36:46.411 --> 00:36:47.010
<v Speaker 2>that's what he did.</v>

806
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:47.461
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

807
00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:49.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a big stick and he'd come out and</v>

808
00:36:49.261 --> 00:36:50.460
<v Speaker 2>whack us all with it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

809
00:36:50.461 --> 00:36:51.271
<v Speaker 2>we'd all go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

810
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:51.880
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

811
00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.713
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the beauty of it is that I agree </v>

812
00:36:55.081 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 2>ultimately the beauty of comedy more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything else,</v>

813
00:36:56.821 --> 00:36:57.654
<v Speaker 2>that when I would watch those specials </v>
<v Speaker 2>from literally from being 12 years old </v>

814
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.630
<v Speaker 2>to being 35,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I would watch them and go,</v>

815
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.460
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the truth,</v>

816
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.043
<v Speaker 2>is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how any other comic </v>

817
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:11.730
<v Speaker 2>where it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even as his daughter,</v>

818
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:16.200
<v Speaker 2>I would feel changed in some way by each</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his shows.</v>

819
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:20.700
<v Speaker 2>There was something in me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some idea I had about the world had been</v>

820
00:37:20.701 --> 00:37:21.534
<v Speaker 2>stretched in a new way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not always a comfortably uncomfortable </v>

821
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.870
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something had been like,</v>

822
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.793
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little mind expansion had gone on and </v>

823
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there are other comics </v>
<v Speaker 2>who do that.</v>

824
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm entertained by a lot of them.</v>

825
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.103
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does seem that something in comedy </v>

826
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:46.860
<v Speaker 2>has changed where counterculture doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to be very cool anymore.</v>

827
00:37:46.861 --> 00:37:47.694
<v Speaker 2>Your Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the coolest was he was </v>

828
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:49.723
<v Speaker 2>counterculture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now if you were counter </v>

829
00:37:51.471 --> 00:37:52.304
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really means you're sort of against </v>

830
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.080
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against administration.</v>

831
00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:55.914
<v Speaker 2>So you're somehow you were against Obama</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe because of all this </v>

832
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.090
<v Speaker 2>political correctness stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a sense that that's not cool.</v>

833
00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:06.390
<v Speaker 2>So it sort of like the death of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

834
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.690
<v Speaker 2>I think there's still a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>independence in that.</v>

835
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Comics have to always are always the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outsider no matter what.</v>

836
00:38:13.171 --> 00:38:14.004
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they vote and they give a </v>

837
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.893
<v Speaker 2>million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Maher is still going to give Obama </v>

838
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Shit for shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

839
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:19.950
<v Speaker 2>he's still got his positions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

840
00:38:19.951 --> 00:38:20.784
<v Speaker 2>and Louis black to given Bernie Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Maher the other day as he was </v>

841
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.410
<v Speaker 2>saying I support.</v>

842
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:26.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

843
00:38:26.101 --> 00:38:29.320
<v Speaker 2>and I think that really is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent thinking and spirit of,</v>

844
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 2>of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that is,</v>

845
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I really do think that's alive and well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

846
00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:34.050
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

847
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:34.883
<v Speaker 2>I spoke about Amy Schumer earlier when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>first saw amy Schumer three or four </v>

848
00:38:38.201 --> 00:38:39.034
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was on the Roseanne Roast and I </v>

849
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

850
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Dick Jokes girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

851
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fought so hard,</v>

852
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:45.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're telling Dick Jokes.</v>

853
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get.</v>

854
00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:47.764
<v Speaker 2>She was playing a persona that she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of pushing up against all of this </v>

855
00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:53.530
<v Speaker 2>stuff and she's doing it in her own way </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

856
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:57.230
<v Speaker 2>She's counterculture in some way because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is taking her.</v>

857
00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.520
<v Speaker 2>She's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

858
00:38:58.660 --> 00:38:59.493
<v Speaker 2>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a huge feminist and yet she's </v>

859
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:03.290
<v Speaker 2>taking some of it to task at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

860
00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:04.840
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I like that.</v>

861
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:06.630
<v Speaker 2>She makes us a little uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>around that</v>

862
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.440
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

863
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.900
<v Speaker 1>we could talk about your dad and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff forever,</v>

864
00:39:09.901 --> 00:39:13.730
<v Speaker 1>but I want to shift a little bit to sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how we know each other past couple of</v>

865
00:39:13.731 --> 00:39:14.564
<v Speaker 1>years and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of the things that we talk </v>

866
00:39:15.811 --> 00:39:18.080
<v Speaker 1>about all the time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

867
00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:18.943
<v Speaker 1>So you have these parties every couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of weeks at your house where you bring </v>

868
00:39:21.331 --> 00:39:22.164
<v Speaker 1>basically what I would describe as sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the wackiest mix of comedians and </v>

869
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:32.190
<v Speaker 1>actors and writers and philosophers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

870
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.670
<v Speaker 1>what other professions are there behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera.</v>

871
00:39:34.671 --> 00:39:35.570
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians,</v>

872
00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.013
<v Speaker 1>this wild crew of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's always changing and coming and </v>

873
00:39:39.631 --> 00:39:40.490
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

874
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.343
<v Speaker 1>and you call the poly mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I first want you to explain what </v>

875
00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.373
<v Speaker 1>it means to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason I love it so much in it </v>

876
00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.790
<v Speaker 1>because it's so become part of how I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated this show,</v>

877
00:39:50.791 --> 00:39:55.140
<v Speaker 1>that I want my audience to be part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about.</v>

878
00:39:55.141 --> 00:39:57.980
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now explain what,</v>

879
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.230
<v Speaker 1>what the poly mind is and most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you've had at your parties.</v>

880
00:40:01.231 --> 00:40:02.064
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had on previous incarnations my </v>

881
00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:04.290
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you,</v>

882
00:40:04.291 --> 00:40:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really like opened up like a zillion</v>

883
00:40:06.511 --> 00:40:08.460
<v Speaker 1>friends to me in the comedy community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that</v>

884
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:09.781
<v Speaker 2>part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

885
00:40:09.781 --> 00:40:10.614
<v Speaker 2>I love community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think being an only child I was a </v>

886
00:40:12.671 --> 00:40:13.380
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

887
00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I was a loner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit lonely.</v>

888
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:16.403
<v Speaker 2>So community's always been important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and especially in the last 20 years </v>

889
00:40:19.891 --> 00:40:22.250
<v Speaker 2>I've really felt that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

890
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:23.803
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of what happened and how this </v>

891
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.800
<v Speaker 2>came to be was when my dad died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became part of the comedy community,</v>

892
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:29.663
<v Speaker 2>which I was not a part of before and met</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul prevents and Paul Provenza knows </v>

893
00:40:32.731 --> 00:40:33.564
<v Speaker 2>everybody and he is part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he and him and my world kind of </v>

894
00:40:37.981 --> 00:40:42.210
<v Speaker 2>merged in this thing called the what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>call the poly mine commune emerged.</v>

895
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.400
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poly mind is,</v>

896
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.280
<v Speaker 2>comes from my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my roots of studying,</v>

897
00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl Jung's psychology,</v>

898
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.813
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the collective unconscious that we have </v>

899
00:40:52.771 --> 00:40:57.300
<v Speaker 2>all these archetypes inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have all these voices in our head and</v>

900
00:40:57.301 --> 00:41:00.330
<v Speaker 2>they all have a right to have a voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

901
00:41:00.331 --> 00:41:04.980
<v Speaker 2>from the most staunch conservative voice</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our head to the most liberal voice,</v>

902
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

903
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.100
<v Speaker 2>to the most immature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the most mature.</v>

904
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:08.943
<v Speaker 2>We all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything gets a voice and gets a seat </v>

905
00:41:11.431 --> 00:41:15.060
<v Speaker 2>at the table at some point because every</v>
<v Speaker 2>voice ultimately is important.</v>

906
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.091
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me get this clear.</v>

907
00:41:16.091 --> 00:41:16.924
<v Speaker 1>We're not supposed to shout down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>voices we don't like and we're not </v>

908
00:41:18.881 --> 00:41:21.740
<v Speaker 1>supposed to call them bigots and racists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and homophobic and sexist.</v>

909
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

910
00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the way,</v>

911
00:41:23.971 --> 00:41:27.480
<v Speaker 2>the reason we do that in public is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have such intolerance for the</v>

912
00:41:27.481 --> 00:41:29.310
<v Speaker 2>voices inside of our heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

913
00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I think what his enter his outer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

914
00:41:31.501 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of.</v>

915
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:34.544
<v Speaker 2>I just love that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I just came up with this word </v>

916
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:40.680
<v Speaker 2>poly mind because I really feel like we </v>
<v Speaker 2>all are individually a polyman,</v>

917
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:41.533
<v Speaker 2>but community in itself is a polyamide </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we each have our own perspectives </v>

918
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:49.100
<v Speaker 2>and their own way of seeing it in and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can agree on 10 things.</v>

919
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 2>And then there's four things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally disagree on it.</v>

920
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We love each other.</v>

921
00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Imagine a read on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be terrible.</v>

922
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.640
<v Speaker 2>It would be boring and there there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning and expanding and there's no,</v>

923
00:42:01.641 --> 00:42:02.474
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

924
00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.210
<v Speaker 2>there's no juice in life at all then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

925
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.460
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

926
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:07.520
<v Speaker 2>so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

927
00:42:07.521 --> 00:42:10.220
<v Speaker 2>playfully call it the poly mine commune,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

928
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.070
<v Speaker 2>because ultimately I'm a Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 2>the blues and the weed helps of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>it does test and,</v>

930
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.500
<v Speaker 2>but really it's become um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I love,</v>

931
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:23.900
<v Speaker 2>what happens in these things is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

932
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:29.180
<v Speaker 2>this cross pollination happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my favorite thing which happens when</v>

933
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.961
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

934
00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had a lot of big parties </v>
<v Speaker 2>lately.</v>

935
00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:34.340
<v Speaker 2>I used to have a lot of big parties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the big parties,</v>

936
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.203
<v Speaker 2>maybe 60 people will be at my house and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it always happens that two people will </v>

937
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:44.801
<v Speaker 2>encounter each other in my kitchen who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have not seen each other in 15 years who</v>

938
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 2>grew up together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was something crazy like that.</v>

939
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.260
<v Speaker 2>And there's this re,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

940
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:51.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this reunited reunited and it feels and </v>

941
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.533
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's like suddenly they're </v>

942
00:42:58.011 --> 00:42:58.844
<v Speaker 2>collaborating on a thing like three </v>
<v Speaker 2>months later I hear they're </v>

943
00:43:01.311 --> 00:43:02.144
<v Speaker 2>collaborating on a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of collaboration going on </v>

944
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:05.803
<v Speaker 2>and that I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just brings me such joy to know </v>

945
00:43:07.761 --> 00:43:10.970
<v Speaker 2>that I can create a space for that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>

946
00:43:10.971 --> 00:43:11.804
<v Speaker 2>It is really good.</v>

947
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean I can give you a living,</v>

948
00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:14.354
<v Speaker 1>breathing example of that as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Rosanne and I became good </v>

949
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:19.340
<v Speaker 1>friends and we've been working together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing things.</v>

950
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.000
<v Speaker 1>One of the more interesting ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened at your place was,</v>

951
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was probably about a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

952
00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I met Taylor Negron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who for those that don't know him was,</v>

953
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:31.670
<v Speaker 1>he was a brilliant comic actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then stand up really in the eighties</v>

954
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.710
<v Speaker 1>into the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>storytime brilliant,</v>

955
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy who I loved without </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing him.</v>

956
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:37.604
<v Speaker 1>And then I met him one night at the fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>pit at your place and we were talking </v>

957
00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:43.490
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tell like he thought I was funny</v>

958
00:43:43.491 --> 00:43:45.800
<v Speaker 1>that I got it kind of thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

959
00:43:45.801 --> 00:43:46.634
<v Speaker 1>we were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking and then I told him about my </v>

960
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:48.044
<v Speaker 1>show and he said he would do my show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then literally two months later I </v>

961
00:43:50.721 --> 00:43:54.410
<v Speaker 1>found out he was dead like didn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I assume he knew he was sick.</v>

962
00:43:54.411 --> 00:43:55.244
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a lot about the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those types of things are what's </v>

963
00:43:58.581 --> 00:44:00.950
<v Speaker 1>going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what was so magical about it.</v>

964
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

965
00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.153
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people feel comfortable to be </v>

966
00:44:05.231 --> 00:44:06.160
<v Speaker 2>themselves there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

967
00:44:06.161 --> 00:44:09.070
<v Speaker 2>that's why Roseanne will come to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>house and I know it's not like I have,</v>

968
00:44:09.071 --> 00:44:09.904
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not like all these a list </v>

969
00:44:11.651 --> 00:44:14.980
<v Speaker 2>celebrities sitting around my fire pit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like that actually.</v>

970
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:16.143
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

971
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.073
<v Speaker 2>every once in a while Roseanne will come</v>
<v Speaker 2>by and she feels comfortable there </v>

972
00:44:19.421 --> 00:44:22.420
<v Speaker 2>because no one's like gawking at her or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

973
00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.600
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>

974
00:44:24.601 --> 00:44:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time she came to my house,</v>

975
00:44:26.231 --> 00:44:28.120
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was one of those moments because even</v>

976
00:44:28.121 --> 00:44:30.070
<v Speaker 2>though I grew up being my dad's daughter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything,</v>

977
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>icons to me,</v>

978
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.900
<v Speaker 2>and I'll never forget the first day she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there,</v>

979
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:34.734
<v Speaker 2>her and Rick Overton and Paul Provenza,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting around the fire pit and </v>

980
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking by with some friends and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going,</v>

981
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in my backyard?</v>

982
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.850
<v Speaker 2>And meanwhile you're the daughter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>George Carlin.</v>

983
00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:47.610
<v Speaker 2>So I have no concept of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just who I am.</v>

984
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:48.390
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

985
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.890
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

986
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:49.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet this incredible thing starts to </v>

987
00:44:51.631 --> 00:44:52.820
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

988
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.690
<v Speaker 2>believe people will start collaborating </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

989
00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:55.710
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful.</v>

990
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:59.040
<v Speaker 2>And I don't even really bring this up so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that for the purposes of name dropping,</v>

991
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.750
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as that,</v>

992
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:01.584
<v Speaker 2>there's something really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you can connect people that care </v>

993
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:05.154
<v Speaker 2>about the same things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what we're trying to </v>

994
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:07.284
<v Speaker 2>do here and that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's the hope of our </v>

995
00:45:10.831 --> 00:45:11.664
<v Speaker 2>species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we can have a safe space for </v>

996
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:16.450
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

997
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:18.630
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things about the internet,</v>

998
00:45:18.631 --> 00:45:22.320
<v Speaker 2>which is fabulous because we met on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and all of that is great,</v>

999
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.920
<v Speaker 2>but there doesn't feel like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of safe space,</v>

1000
00:45:25.921 --> 00:45:26.754
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to really filter through a lot </v>

1001
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.863
<v Speaker 2>of anger and rage and lonely people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are trying to make a dent in the world </v>

1002
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.490
<v Speaker 2>and not do it in a nice way.</v>

1003
00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not conducive to conversation or </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>

1004
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.313
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very little listening going on </v>

1005
00:45:44.821 --> 00:45:47.280
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of talking going on.</v>

1006
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.330
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1007
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.910
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our lives,</v>

1008
00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:54.000
<v Speaker 2>we are trying to create space where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can hear each other,</v>

1009
00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.193
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1010
00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:56.283
<v Speaker 2>well I'm glad you mentioned the online </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and twitter because one of the </v>

1011
00:45:58.171 --> 00:46:01.880
<v Speaker 2>things we talk about all the time is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even have this device.</v>

1012
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:03.900
<v Speaker 2>The device I was going to go into my </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket.</v>

1013
00:46:03.901 --> 00:46:06.430
<v Speaker 2>But fortunately I actually gave it to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>producer before we started.</v>

1014
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.403
<v Speaker 2>I don't have it on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a rare moment that I don't have </v>

1015
00:46:08.671 --> 00:46:09.690
<v Speaker 2>my phone on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you reading?</v>

1016
00:46:09.691 --> 00:46:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Are you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally okay.</v>

1017
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 2>And we're here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1018
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.830
<v Speaker 2>We're present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're here.</v>

1019
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:16.410
<v Speaker 2>We're having a conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not like it's not right.</v>

1020
00:46:16.411 --> 00:46:17.244
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the reason I think we talked </v>

1021
00:46:19.171 --> 00:46:21.030
<v Speaker 2>about all the time is because we hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1022
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.630
<v Speaker 2>We and we love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1023
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:27.810
<v Speaker 2>and yet it brought us together and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time I want to make a living</v>

1024
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:31.860
<v Speaker 2>using it because we find an audience and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can connect with an audience with it.</v>

1025
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found my voice on twitter.</v>

1026
00:46:34.411 --> 00:46:35.244
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned to write a joke because of </v>

1027
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:39.030
<v Speaker 2>twitter and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the limit of twitter that go onto me</v>

1028
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:39.864
<v Speaker 2>of words that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think they're planning on </v>

1029
00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:42.241
<v Speaker 2>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1030
00:46:42.241 --> 00:46:45.030
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love twitter,</v>

1031
00:46:45.031 --> 00:46:47.010
<v Speaker 2>but I told you I'm not going to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying your dad for that.</v>

1032
00:46:47.011 --> 00:46:48.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1033
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:51.690
<v Speaker 2>but this device and this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in this horror,</v>

1034
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you,</v>

1035
00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:54.323
<v Speaker 2>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me it's a net win at the end of the </v>

1036
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.181
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the net week,</v>

1037
00:46:56.181 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 2>but it is connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people.</v>

1038
00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:02.040
<v Speaker 2>It's literally helped revolutions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt.</v>

1039
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then on the other hand,</v>

1040
00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:07.260
<v Speaker 2>I see people's attention spans are being</v>
<v Speaker 2>shredded.</v>

1041
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.153
<v Speaker 2>There's no more stories about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neurons in people's brains are firing </v>

1042
00:47:11.551 --> 00:47:12.384
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1043
00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:13.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every two seconds.</v>

1044
00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:14.634
<v Speaker 2>And if you're on a street corner meeting</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend where you might have to stand </v>

1045
00:47:17.161 --> 00:47:19.410
<v Speaker 2>there and look up at the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God forbid you're,</v>

1046
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're liking instagram and you're like,</v>

1047
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like this person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all of this stuff.</v>

1048
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 2>I think for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's really.</v>

1049
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even on a new level,</v>

1050
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:32.554
<v Speaker 2>just in the last month or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really am starting to get sick of the </v>

1051
00:47:36.611 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 2>intrusiveness of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare it.</v>

1052
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.613
<v Speaker 2>And I say it like it's some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous thing and I haven't invited </v>

1053
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:45.980
<v Speaker 2>it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not autonomous yet,</v>

1054
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:49.330
<v Speaker 2>but it does kind of feel that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's the part of my brain.</v>

1055
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't feel like I have control </v>
<v Speaker 2>over that part of my brain.</v>

1056
00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:56.390
<v Speaker 2>So it is feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I really feel like if you want to be</v>

1057
00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:58.173
<v Speaker 2>the fear is that if you put it away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be part of the </v>

1058
00:47:59.891 --> 00:48:02.300
<v Speaker 2>culture that you feel like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually missing.</v>

1059
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.000
<v Speaker 2>So you do feel like you're missing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and you know,</v>

1060
00:48:04.001 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 2>you probably are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as you know,</v>

1061
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:10.630
<v Speaker 2>when you and I do our little retreats </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are electronic retreats and we turn</v>

1062
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:13.210
<v Speaker 2>off for a week or 10 days or sometimes a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend,</v>

1063
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.570
<v Speaker 1>you don't really miss that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1064
00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:18.070
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it goes on.</v>

1065
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.230
<v Speaker 1>So right before we launched the show in </v>
<v Speaker 1>September,</v>

1066
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I got married the week before in Sonoma </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've told you this,</v>

1067
00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:26.050
<v Speaker 1>but I did 10 days off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not look at my phone for 10 days.</v>

1068
00:48:26.051 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't look at email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't look at twitter,</v>

1069
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.593
<v Speaker 1>I didn't post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted one thing on youtube for 30 </v>

1070
00:48:29.861 --> 00:48:31.390
<v Speaker 1>seconds just to say I'll be back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1071
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been worried about me.</v>

1072
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone is entail fitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

1073
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I thought they cared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>

1074
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:44.260
<v Speaker 1>But I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely felt my brain resetting.</v>

1075
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.920
<v Speaker 1>I felt I've described to you before as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1076
00:48:46.921 --> 00:48:47.754
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you used to turn on an old desktop </v>

1077
00:48:48.611 --> 00:48:51.940
<v Speaker 1>computer and there'll be some worrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some being being.</v>

1078
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And I felt bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually felt that in my head and then</v>

1079
00:48:56.411 --> 00:48:58.030
<v Speaker 1>when I got back I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1080
00:48:58.031 --> 00:48:59.940
<v Speaker 1>everyone's just up to the same old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1081
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.700
<v Speaker 2>same old conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same old annoyances,</v>

1082
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 2>same old bitching and moaning.</v>

1083
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:07.610
<v Speaker 1>And yet we're both agreeing it's net </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1084
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:09.410
<v Speaker 1>So is that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the conundrum</v>

1085
00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:13.730
<v Speaker 2>I think in and so it really is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else,</v>

1086
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:18.560
<v Speaker 2>it's neutral so it's can be used for </v>
<v Speaker 2>good or evil and like everything else,</v>

1087
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.633
<v Speaker 2>you have to be conscious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to really decide what are you </v>

1088
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:28.961
<v Speaker 2>using this for in your life and in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your career and how much of it,</v>

1089
00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:30.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1090
00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:31.903
<v Speaker 2>there may be an overall net good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how much of it is a net negative in </v>

1091
00:49:36.801 --> 00:49:41.240
<v Speaker 2>your life and your personal life and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your process and your creative process?</v>

1092
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:42.583
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been finding lately that I'm doing </v>

1093
00:49:44.721 --> 00:49:45.554
<v Speaker 2>much better away from it all because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going deep down to try to figure out </v>

1094
00:49:49.251 --> 00:49:50.084
<v Speaker 2>what my next book is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that when I'm online and I'm </v>

1095
00:49:54.051 --> 00:49:56.630
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking out into the world.</v>

1096
00:49:56.631 --> 00:49:57.464
<v Speaker 2>I have to go inside of myself to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff out and do some research and </v>

1097
00:50:01.881 --> 00:50:02.714
<v Speaker 2>some things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have to be very conscious about </v>

1098
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.880
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing.</v>

1099
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1100
00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:08.653
<v Speaker 2>and that's my process and I'm figuring </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out and I think the longer we have </v>

1101
00:50:12.651 --> 00:50:13.484
<v Speaker 2>this technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to think about it in </v>

1102
00:50:15.561 --> 00:50:20.480
<v Speaker 2>2008 was the first smartphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first iphone came out.</v>

1103
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:25.640
<v Speaker 2>That's only been seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a species,</v>

1104
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.150
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing as a culture that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1105
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:34.400
<v Speaker 2>So we are starting to feel the pain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and,</v>

1106
00:50:34.401 --> 00:50:37.850
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the problems with it and I,</v>

1107
00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:38.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we're going to start making </v>

1108
00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:43.490
<v Speaker 2>some real new decisions about it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing that,</v>

1109
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:45.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm already doing that in my</v>

1110
00:50:45.231 --> 00:50:46.400
<v Speaker 2>own personal life.</v>

1111
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only doing it in your personal </v>

1112
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:49.263
<v Speaker 1>and your professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you do a podcast also where you talk </v>

1113
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:51.974
<v Speaker 1>a lot about sort of waking up and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual journey that we're on and </v>

1114
00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I think all of that is directly related </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this stuff because when we're,</v>

1115
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.230
<v Speaker 1>when we're in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are fighting,</v>

1116
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.870
<v Speaker 1>people are approved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving you an endless approval.</v>

1117
00:51:08.871 --> 00:51:11.720
<v Speaker 1>But to me it's like the approval stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really nice.</v>

1118
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:13.550
<v Speaker 1>It's nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like that it's like,</v>

1119
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.413
<v Speaker 1>oh well I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm putting saying good out </v>

1120
00:51:15.831 --> 00:51:16.940
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's nice to be acknowledged.</v>

1121
00:51:16.941 --> 00:51:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't really dwell on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you get some negative stuff and</v>

1122
00:51:20.241 --> 00:51:21.790
<v Speaker 1>it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can spin you out out.</v>

1123
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Tell it days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I mean about this.</v>

1124
00:51:23.511 --> 00:51:27.020
<v Speaker 1>All this all being live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing is actually alive</v>

1125
00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.500
<v Speaker 2>and yet there's something exciting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1126
00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:31.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if we were really to become a </v>

1127
00:51:33.331 --> 00:51:34.164
<v Speaker 2>collective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conscious collective mind on some </v>

1128
00:51:37.381 --> 00:51:38.214
<v Speaker 2>level where we could really solve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>really big problems that we need to </v>

1129
00:51:42.511 --> 00:51:45.630
<v Speaker 2>solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need many voices to do that.</v>

1130
00:51:45.631 --> 00:51:47.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what democracy is about,</v>

1131
00:51:47.161 --> 00:51:50.430
<v Speaker 2>this marketplace of ideas and so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>invites that,</v>

1132
00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:51.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this other level of connection </v>

1133
00:51:53.191 --> 00:51:54.024
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1134
00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:55.043
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a Pakistani hip hop artists a </v>

1135
00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.171
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Omar,</v>

1136
00:51:58.171 --> 00:52:02.580
<v Speaker 2>who I met also on twitter fan of my dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he saw youtube videos.</v>

1137
00:52:02.581 --> 00:52:06.990
<v Speaker 2>This kid is 20 something in Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hip hop artist.</v>

1138
00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.600
<v Speaker 2>He was just at my house a few nights </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1139
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.823
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing that he and I connected </v>

1140
00:52:14.731 --> 00:52:18.690
<v Speaker 2>in the world on twitter to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 2>once again and now we're friends in real</v>

1141
00:52:18.691 --> 00:52:20.300
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1142
00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:24.810
<v Speaker 2>there is hope for a species when we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do stuff like that.</v>

1143
00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:25.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1144
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.930
<v Speaker 2>we sat around the fire pit the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and we really asked them,</v>

1145
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:30.600
<v Speaker 2>what's it like there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on,</v>

1146
00:52:30.601 --> 00:52:31.434
<v Speaker 2>what's the thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the Pakistani government really </v>

1147
00:52:33.121 --> 00:52:34.200
<v Speaker 2>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1148
00:52:34.201 --> 00:52:35.034
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to have that conversation with </v>

1149
00:52:37.051 --> 00:52:39.180
<v Speaker 2>someone because of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1150
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.580
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1151
00:52:41.581 --> 00:52:42.414
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the trolling and all of the </v>

1152
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.770
<v Speaker 2>distraction and all of the Click Bait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1153
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.270
<v Speaker 2>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like anything else,</v>

1154
00:52:51.271 --> 00:52:52.104
<v Speaker 2>you either going to let the distraction </v>
<v Speaker 2>distract you because that's what they </v>

1155
00:52:54.541 --> 00:52:55.321
<v Speaker 2>all want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1156
00:52:55.321 --> 00:52:57.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were the fuck that is.</v>

1157
00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.673
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately keep us fighting with each </v>

1158
00:53:01.621 --> 00:53:05.490
<v Speaker 2>other and then we can't look at the real</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and try to solve them.</v>

1159
00:53:05.491 --> 00:53:05.750
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

1160
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:06.583
<v Speaker 1>Literally how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw in the green </v>

1161
00:53:08.271 --> 00:53:09.500
<v Speaker 1>room at the beginning of that's how I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

1162
00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1163
00:53:10.271 --> 00:53:11.104
<v Speaker 2>and so therefore we're not really having</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real conversations we should be </v>

1164
00:53:14.721 --> 00:53:18.470
<v Speaker 2>having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dammit we are because you're here,</v>

1165
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.453
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of real good conversation </v>

1166
00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:24.040
<v Speaker 2>going on in the world now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1167
00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.870
<v Speaker 2>but we have to be the grownups and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ya know,</v>

1168
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:28.920
<v Speaker 2>more clickbait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1169
00:53:28.921 --> 00:53:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it,</v>

1170
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:31.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1171
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.863
<v Speaker 2>and the ones who are distracted by it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's always going to be mob </v>

1172
00:53:34.441 --> 00:53:36.720
<v Speaker 2>mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the species.</v>

1173
00:53:36.721 --> 00:53:37.620
<v Speaker 2>It's how we're wired.</v>

1174
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's so nice about doing </v>

1175
00:53:39.471 --> 00:53:40.304
<v Speaker 1>something that I think people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to the way they are because </v>

1176
00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.160
<v Speaker 1>there's so much crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like there's five things and</v>

1177
00:53:46.161 --> 00:53:47.600
<v Speaker 1>they're finding something that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to.</v>

1178
00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:51.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a good jillion things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're finding some something that's,</v>

1179
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:53.810
<v Speaker 1>that gives them a little sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence or a little center.</v>

1180
00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are hungry for it.</v>

1181
00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:57.520
<v Speaker 2>And I think after this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1182
00:53:57.521 --> 00:53:58.354
<v Speaker 2>this Internet explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all had fun being distracted for the </v>

1183
00:54:01.331 --> 00:54:05.170
<v Speaker 2>last we all 10 years or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all fun to be distracted.</v>

1184
00:54:05.171 --> 00:54:06.820
<v Speaker 2>But now it's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1185
00:54:06.821 --> 00:54:09.010
<v Speaker 2>it's the hottest year again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1186
00:54:09.011 --> 00:54:10.030
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy weather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1187
00:54:10.031 --> 00:54:11.770
<v Speaker 2>this shit's really going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1188
00:54:11.771 --> 00:54:14.950
<v Speaker 2>there's no one gonna fucking be sweeping</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the sky and rescuing us.</v>

1189
00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.173
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we do need to get our shit </v>

1190
00:54:16.811 --> 00:54:19.060
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we do need to just.</v>

1191
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.073
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to be these serious </v>

1192
00:54:21.011 --> 00:54:24.340
<v Speaker 2>heavy as conversations all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where are the grownups?</v>

1193
00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I want to go hang out with the grownups </v>
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>

1194
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:30.310
<v Speaker 2>smoke some pot and have a nice drink and</v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh and be silly too.</v>

1195
00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:32.020
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1196
00:54:32.021 --> 00:54:32.854
<v Speaker 2>I want to be hanging out with the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are kind of trying to think </v>

1197
00:54:34.721 --> 00:54:35.554
<v Speaker 2>straight about that.</v>

1198
00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're trying to build here.</v>

1199
00:54:36.911 --> 00:54:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I almost feel that that should be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending of the show.</v>

1200
00:54:39.011 --> 00:54:41.680
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going to give you one more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you one bonus question</v>

1201
00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:43.420
<v Speaker 1>which is what's next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's next?</v>

1202
00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:45.010
<v Speaker 1>What's this worth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the next after all this,</v>

1203
00:54:45.011 --> 00:54:45.844
<v Speaker 1>because I know how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of you you had to pour into </v>

1204
00:54:47.321 --> 00:54:48.154
<v Speaker 1>this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the copies before I saw the </v>

1205
00:54:49.691 --> 00:54:53.260
<v Speaker 1>manuscript when it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a printed from your printer and all</v>

1206
00:54:53.261 --> 00:54:54.094
<v Speaker 1>that and how much you had to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself into this and go into talking </v>

1207
00:54:57.311 --> 00:55:00.580
<v Speaker 1>about things that are scary to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and in and expose your,</v>

1208
00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:01.443
<v Speaker 1>not only your dad but your mom in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole life and your whole life in a </v>

1209
00:55:03.761 --> 00:55:05.760
<v Speaker 1>way that people didn't know and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1210
00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:06.813
<v Speaker 1>especially because someone like your dad</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's held up to this thing and </v>

1211
00:55:08.591 --> 00:55:11.020
<v Speaker 1>that you were showing him in a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>light and all that stuff.</v>

1212
00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Where do you go?</v>

1213
00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:13.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think there's been kind of two </v>

1214
00:55:15.791 --> 00:55:16.624
<v Speaker 2>mes the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that's had this book in me and </v>

1215
00:55:19.151 --> 00:55:21.950
<v Speaker 2>know that it was unfinished business and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I had to,</v>

1216
00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:24.243
<v Speaker 2>that in some ways it was going to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>me permission to have a bigger </v>

1217
00:55:26.981 --> 00:55:28.430
<v Speaker 2>conversation in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1218
00:55:28.431 --> 00:55:29.264
<v Speaker 2>and on a personal level it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfinished business just around my </v>

1219
00:55:33.221 --> 00:55:35.950
<v Speaker 2>psychological healing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1220
00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:36.903
<v Speaker 2>I mean I am a person who had studied </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and I do focus more on the </v>

1221
00:55:40.811 --> 00:55:42.970
<v Speaker 2>inner life and the cultural life on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some levels,</v>

1222
00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.680
<v Speaker 2>although I'm pretty 50 slash 50 these </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

1223
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:48.830
<v Speaker 2>So really I think my next thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really pointing my,</v>

1224
00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:52.930
<v Speaker 2>my mind slightly more outwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1225
00:55:52.931 --> 00:55:53.764
<v Speaker 2>that it'll always be interested in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal process and how do we get from </v>

1226
00:55:57.701 --> 00:56:01.840
<v Speaker 2>a to B and B to c and C to d.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think they're really connected.</v>

1227
00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I think how we do this on the inside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>micro is connected to the macro and,</v>

1228
00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:12.790
<v Speaker 2>and how we treat ourselves is ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we treat each other and how we treat</v>

1229
00:56:12.791 --> 00:56:13.624
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm interested in connecting all </v>

1230
00:56:15.701 --> 00:56:16.534
<v Speaker 2>of those dots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what it looks like </v>

1231
00:56:18.101 --> 00:56:18.934
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking I'm going to start up my </v>

1232
00:56:20.381 --> 00:56:21.214
<v Speaker 2>podcast again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking to something a little more </v>

1233
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:25.893
<v Speaker 2>elevated level around the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe with video or something and </v>

1234
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:32.020
<v Speaker 2>finding a new format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1235
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I've suddenly become the humanist girl I</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to.</v>

1236
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I did a keynote speech at the humanist </v>
<v Speaker 2>association,</v>

1237
00:56:39.011 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 2>American Humanist Association conference</v>
<v Speaker 2>last summer.</v>

1238
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:42.583
<v Speaker 2>I was speaking at the reason rally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking at the reason rally and </v>

1239
00:56:44.531 --> 00:56:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I've been hired to do another one in May</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Vancouver.</v>

1240
00:56:47.801 --> 00:56:50.500
<v Speaker 2>And I'm suddenly like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the spiritual humanist girl.</v>

1241
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1242
00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:52.600
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting.</v>

1243
00:56:52.601 --> 00:56:53.434
<v Speaker 2>But there's something about soul and </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning and the inner life that I think </v>

1244
00:56:58.451 --> 00:56:59.284
<v Speaker 2>is important and it's important part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation and doesn't have to be </v>

1245
00:57:01.211 --> 00:57:02.044
<v Speaker 2>thrown out just because we don't believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole church bullshit and religion </v>

1246
00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.180
<v Speaker 2>of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1247
00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:10.690
<v Speaker 2>there's still way to find meaning in </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder.</v>

1248
00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I think wonder is a really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect.</v>

1249
00:57:14.321 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 2>If we could get reconnected to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder of being alive,</v>

1250
00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:20.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd all</v>

1251
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.810
<v Speaker 1>appreciate people a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop yelling at each other,</v>

1252
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.700
<v Speaker 1>yelling at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1253
00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:26.883
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously it's not going to </v>

1254
00:57:27.441 --> 00:57:28.070
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1255
00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:28.903
<v Speaker 1>but I really believe so and I think we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would really treat our planet a little </v>

1256
00:57:30.591 --> 00:57:31.424
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

1257
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of want to be in the wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

1258
00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:36.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1259
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that the answer was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that direction,</v>

1260
