<v Speaker 1>Cameron Caskey.</v>

5
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm really happy that you're here for </v>
<v Speaker 1>for many reasons.</v>

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.483
<v Speaker 1>Mostly because you strike me suddenly as</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that's trying to find some </v>

8
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:32.870
<v Speaker 1>common ground these days and we're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into that in a whole bunch more.</v>

9
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:33.561
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:34.394
<v Speaker 1>of course I have to mention up top you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are a survivor of the parkland shooting </v>

11
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.693
<v Speaker 1>before we go whole into that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you've been through </v>

13
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:44.414
<v Speaker 1>since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just tell me a little bit about life </v>

14
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.863
<v Speaker 1>before [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume you have a life before and now </v>

15
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.573
<v Speaker 1>a new life.</v>

16
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:54.494
<v Speaker 2>I spent most of my life as your typical </v>
<v Speaker 2>little shitster who just said whatever </v>

18
00:00:58.581 --> 00:00:59.414
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to have a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always so convinced that I was </v>

19
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:02.294
<v Speaker 2>right about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether that was nature and nurture is </v>

20
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.803
<v Speaker 2>kind of up to interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really grew up just dead set on </v>

21
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:10.904
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I knew everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything I said was right and I was a </v>

22
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:14.624
<v Speaker 2>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned the hard way recently little </v>

23
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 2>to recently that I'm not and that was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy awakening.</v>

24
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:20.624
<v Speaker 2>Learning that you don't know everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the entire world is actually an </v>

25
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:23.894
<v Speaker 2>interesting experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that helped me a </v>

26
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:27.014
<v Speaker 2>lot was doing theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a big theater kid because I had </v>

27
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 2>this voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to express myself.</v>

28
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:35.170
<v Speaker 2>I was a flippantly loud all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

29
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what to do with it.</v>

30
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.653
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was knocking doors for Obama when I </v>

31
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 2>was seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

32
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really interested in being active </v>

33
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:43.371
<v Speaker 2>with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:44.204
<v Speaker 2>I knew nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that John Mccain was running </v>

35
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:47.144
<v Speaker 2>with Tina Fey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Sarah Pailin because I had really </v>

36
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 2>only seen the news and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I got it mixed up with seven.</v>

37
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I didn't expect myself to be a policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>expert,</v>

38
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.680
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

39
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I think the point is I was always really</v>
<v Speaker 2>excited to speak and,</v>

40
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>and I got involved with drama and drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said,</v>

41
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a voice,</v>

42
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.483
<v Speaker 2>here's the way to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you learn a lot of lessons from </v>

43
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 2>doing theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you,</v>

44
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 2>have you ever done anything else,</v>

45
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>steve at school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In high school.</v>

46
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I did spend 12 years doing standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy in New York City,</v>

47
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>which is a whole other nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

48
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.931
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

49
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:20.764
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to do stand up and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried it once when I was seven years </v>

50
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:24.004
<v Speaker 2>old I was on a cruise with my family and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a kind of adults only </v>

51
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:28.744
<v Speaker 2>nightclub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't really you're able to get in </v>

52
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:31.894
<v Speaker 2>if you were younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was the only person there under </v>

53
00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe 40 and they had an open mic and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>kept on,</v>

54
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I kept on raising my hand to get on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hosts was saying,</v>

55
00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:39.004
<v Speaker 2>know what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>

56
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.883
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is this kid doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And finally he just caved in and was </v>

57
00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:42.281
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

58
00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:43.114
<v Speaker 2>let's let the kid get up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I walked out there and I drop a </v>

59
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 2>three minute routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make a joke about my dad's penis,</v>

60
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.693
<v Speaker 2>which was an interesting experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is I did not know that </v>

61
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.130
<v Speaker 2>while I was sitting alone in the front </v>
<v Speaker 2>row,</v>

62
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.973
<v Speaker 2>I snuck out of my room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my went to the club and I didn't see </v>

63
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:01.410
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

64
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 2>So I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out there,</v>

65
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you the,</v>

66
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.853
<v Speaker 2>the clip privately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out there and I'm four foot three </v>

67
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.553
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's drunk so they think I'm </v>

68
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 2>a riot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think I'm a riot.</v>

69
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:13.144
<v Speaker 2>And I just kept going and going to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where the guy who was running the </v>

70
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 2>open mic was just looming behind me </v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting for me to be done.</v>

71
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.573
<v Speaker 2>But I guess he just didn't want to grab </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mic from a small child without </v>

72
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 2>looking kind of weird.</v>

73
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Stand up is probably best done once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's seven years old and never again.</v>

74
00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:32.340
<v Speaker 1>So exactly what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's had their 15 minutes of fame</v>

75
00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:33.810
<v Speaker 1>when they were seven on a cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

77
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.950
<v Speaker 1>so you were a theater kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.470
<v Speaker 1>anything else we should know about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like high school life,</v>

79
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:44.190
<v Speaker 1>like high school life for a kid in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018,</v>

80
00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.090
<v Speaker 1>like what's it like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

81
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that old but I ain't 17 anymore.</v>

82
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.881
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school was really fun for me.</v>

84
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed it on a social level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a shitty student.</v>

85
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.683
<v Speaker 2>My test scores were always good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my grades were awful because they </v>

86
00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:57.354
<v Speaker 2>never bothered to do homework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was too smart and cool for </v>

87
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:00.570
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

88
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.513
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked high school a lot because I </v>

89
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.560
<v Speaker 2>never really subscribed to one social </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle.</v>

90
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:07.080
<v Speaker 2>I kind of hung out with a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 2>kids who were the stereotypical popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

92
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just the guy they knew that was </v>

93
00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:12.684
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hang out with that sometimes </v>

94
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.573
<v Speaker 2>kids who were the stereotypical nerds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would talk about movies and comic </v>

95
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:19.230
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I want to get into your comic book</v>

96
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:20.064
<v Speaker 2>collection suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd say that my core group was the </v>

97
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 2>theater kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love my friends from drama and um,</v>

98
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 2>it's really fun having a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends where you'll,</v>

99
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.610
<v Speaker 2>you'll be hanging out on the weekend </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting the Shit and then you'll get to</v>

100
00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:33.444
<v Speaker 2>school and either be falling in love </v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other and making out on stage </v>

101
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.380
<v Speaker 2>or killing each other on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

102
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.240
<v Speaker 2>we just did fiddler on the roof and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to marry one of my best friends.</v>

103
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.980
<v Speaker 2>It was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're familiar.</v>

104
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I am familiar with the lyrics is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classic so.</v>

105
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.473
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like a pretty normal </v>

106
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>childhood that so far</v>

107
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't think someone like me can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>created by normal childhood,</v>

108
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.920
<v Speaker 2>but it was a great childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy.</v>

109
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.763
<v Speaker 2>My parents divorced when I was 10 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky enough to have four </v>

110
00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:01.911
<v Speaker 2>grandparents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>

111
00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:04.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got two brothers and a step sister.</v>

112
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.173
<v Speaker 2>It's a great group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to think that I'm a pretty </v>

113
00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:09.830
<v Speaker 2>moral guy and when I'm the shittiest </v>
<v Speaker 2>person in a family,</v>

114
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:11.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a great family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

115
00:05:11.691 --> 00:05:13.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a standup comic in you.</v>

116
00:05:13.431 --> 00:05:14.264
<v Speaker 2>I can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it doesn't come out anytime </v>

117
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.190
<v Speaker 2>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

118
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.400
<v Speaker 2>So now bring me to that day or earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

119
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.020
<v Speaker 2>So on February 14th there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a regular day.</v>

120
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.243
<v Speaker 2>It was actually a really nice day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a period of time during the </v>

121
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.140
<v Speaker 2>day that I always remember where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that he's gone a little too.</v>

122
00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting reading John Walsh's book,</v>

123
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.940
<v Speaker 2>a tears of rage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

124
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.160
<v Speaker 2>if you're familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the title exactly,</v>

125
00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:37.994
<v Speaker 2>but I was a big fan and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was planning out a Valentine's Day </v>

126
00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:43.650
<v Speaker 2>gift for a girl that I really liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

127
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.533
<v Speaker 2>she had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

128
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 2>she had an endoscopy that day and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

129
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.413
<v Speaker 2>she was on a lot of medicine and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to give her cousin some gifts for </v>

130
00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:50.744
<v Speaker 2>her and have her bring it to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I made her a card that said I would </v>

131
00:05:52.371 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 2>have brought you this myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't have the stomach</v>

132
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.203
<v Speaker 1>or Andra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I printed a picture or a picture of her </v>

133
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:58.410
<v Speaker 1>doctor</v>

134
00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.243
<v Speaker 2>and put it in the cart and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm were in rehearsal for a </v>

135
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 2>musical we were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll vikings,</v>

136
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure nobody's ever heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know it.</v>

137
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

138
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 2>we had just finished up a song I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and I realized,</v>

139
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:12.494
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go pick up my brother because </v>

140
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 2>that's stillman Douglas School lets out </v>
<v Speaker 2>at 2:40,</v>

141
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 2>but the special needs kids are out at </v>
<v Speaker 2>2:10</v>

142
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 2>so the parents can pick them up before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the buses come and my little brother has</v>

143
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 2>autism and he's hanging out there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of his friends and the ESC class.</v>

144
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the autistic scene,</v>

145
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 2>stoneman Douglas is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those kids are the best.</v>

146
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 2>And the school specialized in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it like a magnet school for kids with</v>

147
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 2>autism or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

148
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:37.694
<v Speaker 2>but it has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a great program with great </v>

149
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.164
<v Speaker 2>teachers.</v>

150
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.033
<v Speaker 2>And I actually went back to Portland </v>
<v Speaker 2>this weekend to see them off to </v>

151
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:43.370
<v Speaker 2>homecoming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And boy,</v>

152
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:45.570
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that squad is wild of them.</v>

153
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my little brother,</v>

154
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to brag is kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ringleader over there.</v>

155
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

156
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 2>and I went to go pick them up because on</v>
<v Speaker 2>days like that when my mom was at work,</v>

157
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:56.174
<v Speaker 2>I would take him to drama and he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just hang out and he really loved it </v>

158
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 2>because all the girls would give them </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and you know,</v>

159
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:04.660
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a bit of a cocky little bastard and</v>

160
00:07:04.661 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm a and I realized that it's maybe to </v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

161
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:09.470
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're halfway through the song and I</v>

162
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.304
<v Speaker 2>say I forgot to pick up holding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we finished the song and I asked my </v>

163
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 2>teacher if I could go run and pick them </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

164
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.983
<v Speaker 2>Of course she said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm picking up holding and suddenly </v>

165
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:18.644
<v Speaker 2>there's a fire alarm.</v>

166
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.603
<v Speaker 2>And that was a little scary because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were close to pickup and I was with the </v>

167
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 2>special needs kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were in wheelchairs,</v>

168
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 2>some of whom were not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were a little physically disabled.</v>

169
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 2>And we had to go to the parking lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the buses would come.</v>

170
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

171
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 2>what if this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if this is a real fire?</v>

172
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 2>And I have to sit out here and make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that nobody gets hit by a bus.</v>

173
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.900
<v Speaker 2>There were teachers there of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

174
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a public school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There maybe two teachers for 10,</v>

175
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:49.030
<v Speaker 2>15 students who will need a lot of help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

176
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.233
<v Speaker 2>So we're out there sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parking lot and there were students out </v>

177
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 2>there from other classes nearby who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

178
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a fire drill.</v>

179
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 2>There were students out there who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>with us and it was the Ese class,</v>

180
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:01.760
<v Speaker 2>it was a couple of the nearby classes.</v>

181
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 2>And one of the kids jokingly said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a shooter,</v>

182
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.690
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

183
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.003
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not cool because how could that </v>

184
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:10.454
<v Speaker 2>ever happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

185
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly I see everybody running </v>
<v Speaker 2>back inside and the teacher says,</v>

186
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 2>get inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get inside.</v>

187
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

188
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.960
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a real fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they want to get all the kids inside</v>

189
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:21.794
<v Speaker 2>before the buses come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we're told to go in a room and </v>

190
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:25.784
<v Speaker 2>we're told to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away from the window and turn the </v>

191
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.151
<v Speaker 2>lights off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>

192
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's going on.</v>

193
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.783
<v Speaker 2>And that experience was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was an interesting one because I was in </v>

194
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 2>the leadership room with a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leadership students,</v>

195
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:37.214
<v Speaker 2>which is a class that specializes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>leadership and they planned prom and </v>

196
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:41.804
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of student government and it was </v>

197
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:44.804
<v Speaker 2>also the special needs kids because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the nearest room and some of the </v>

198
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:47.744
<v Speaker 2>students being nonverbal does not mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make noise and some of the </v>

199
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:53.070
<v Speaker 2>students were yelling and wailing.</v>

200
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.903
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately they had shadows and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>special needs teachers at Douglas are </v>

201
00:08:56.221 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>fantastic and we're able to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody calm,</v>

202
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were there for a couple hours and</v>

203
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 2>slowly more details began to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume you're hearing gunfire and.</v>

204
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.573
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

205
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Douglas is a huge school and I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now mind you,</v>

206
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I thought I heard gunfire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're being told you're school</v>

207
00:09:14.901 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 2>is getting shot up and you hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

208
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 2>you might think it's gunfire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm sitting there holding.</v>

209
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 2>My little brother has no idea what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

210
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And slowly I realized,</v>

211
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:26.304
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a shooting I heard and people </v>

212
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 2>were whispering around the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was maybe 20 kids in the room,</v>

213
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 2>people saying 50 people are dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two people are dead.</v>

214
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 2>One person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad.</v>

215
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.243
<v Speaker 2>There were conflicting stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard conflicting stories of who was </v>

216
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 2>who the shooter was.</v>

217
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I heard five different names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful of it was somebody I knew.</v>

218
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.433
<v Speaker 2>Somebody I knew would not pick up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapon to harm a butterfly because </v>

219
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.160
<v Speaker 2>that's hysteria and that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural and I understand it.</v>

220
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Then I saw something that was a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>exhibit of humanity.</v>

221
00:09:57.541 --> 00:09:58.374
<v Speaker 2>If you asked me which was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a snapchat video going around </v>

222
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.823
<v Speaker 2>that was that with the caption Yo with </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple owes my school getting shot up </v>

223
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 2>and it was a video of a dead teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

224
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.643
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna film shooting from </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside a room so you can have evidence </v>

225
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:17.790
<v Speaker 2>to show the police good on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to fill my shooting in a</v>

226
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 2>room and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo my school getting shot up and send it</v>

227
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:21.870
<v Speaker 2>to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.423
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're sitting there in a room </v>

229
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:26.094
<v Speaker 2>not knowing what's going on and you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos of people you know and love </v>

230
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 2>deceased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>

231
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:32.880
<v Speaker 2>the only video I saw was with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>who had,</v>

232
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I had cared about for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a mentor in my life.</v>

233
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.470
<v Speaker 2>You start to realize that nothing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever going to be the same again.</v>

234
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

235
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.373
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's pause for one sec because that we </v>

236
00:10:43.511 --> 00:10:44.344
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't gloss over that part where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media component of this is so </v>

237
00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:48.304
<v Speaker 1>important because you guys all grew up </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this and then you grow up hearing </v>

238
00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:52.690
<v Speaker 1>about school shootings all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could,</v>

239
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who this kid is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

240
00:10:54.701 --> 00:10:55.534
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'm curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfectly fine person or he or she even </v>

241
00:10:58.221 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 1>know what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.640
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

243
00:11:00.641 --> 00:11:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost feels like,</v>

244
00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:03.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the normal thing to do.</v>

245
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a shooting like on </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapchat,</v>

246
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>several people I knew were just treating</v>

247
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:10.290
<v Speaker 2>it like it was normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not the shooting,</v>

248
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:11.124
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that there was a video and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I understand how some people might </v>

249
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 2>like to not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

250
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:20.460
<v Speaker 2>understand having to see that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to understand what's going on.</v>

251
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 2>But I saw it and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you do that?</v>

252
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.360
<v Speaker 2>This is somebody who is deceased and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're filming them to show,</v>

253
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.223
<v Speaker 2>just send it to all your friends and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a reflection of the social media </v>

254
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 2>era we're in where everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

255
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 2>You got to show everyone.</v>

256
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.870
<v Speaker 1>So for how long were you actually in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that room?</v>

257
00:11:37.871 --> 00:11:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Not knowing if you were going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

258
00:11:40.331 --> 00:11:41.800
<v Speaker 1>not knowing what was happening.</v>

259
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.793
<v Speaker 2>I think it was about two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could look at interviews I did a days </v>

260
00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:48.290
<v Speaker 2>after and have a much better gauge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>

261
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.820
<v Speaker 2>but I would call it around two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know the.</v>

262
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.663
<v Speaker 2>When the swat team broke the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the big issue that there are </v>

263
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:55.714
<v Speaker 2>students who are developmentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>disabled in here who might not be able </v>

264
00:11:58.571 --> 00:11:59.404
<v Speaker 2>to put their hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fortunately one of the only good </v>

265
00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:02.614
<v Speaker 2>things you'll see from broward handling </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the shooting was the swat team was </v>

266
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 2>very understanding and was very quick to</v>
<v Speaker 2>help these students,</v>

267
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:09.664
<v Speaker 2>which was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when that glass broke and the first </v>

268
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:14.140
<v Speaker 2>thing that walked into a room was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a rifle.</v>

269
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.280
<v Speaker 2>How are we supposed to know that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't us taken our turn,</v>

270
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 2>but and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was texting their parents.</v>

271
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.223
<v Speaker 2>Everybody at the phone lines were kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of jammed because everybody in Parkland </v>

272
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:26.380
<v Speaker 2>was making a call.</v>

273
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was Parkland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a city with.</v>

274
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.353
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a small town where there's </v>

275
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 2>one high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there one high school?</v>

276
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.203
<v Speaker 2>It was around one high school and we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean nobody should be equipped for </v>

277
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:44.170
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we weren't.</v>

278
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you guys been taught at all?</v>

279
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:47.074
<v Speaker 2>Like are they teaching in high school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what to do if this actually does </v>

280
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a shooter,</v>

281
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 2>she comes to school and we had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion of having a code red drill.</v>

282
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 2>We had long discussions about dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a shooter,</v>

283
00:12:57.401 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 2>but we had never participated in code </v>
<v Speaker 2>red drill,</v>

284
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 2>at least not while I was at school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to skip school a lot.</v>

285
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Tell me a little bit more about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>makeup of Parkland because you mentioned</v>

286
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 2>something interesting that it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little liberal,</v>

287
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.250
<v Speaker 2>pretty liberal area.</v>

288
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.210
<v Speaker 2>It's not homogeneous when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>being liberal,</v>

289
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of different perspectives,</v>

290
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:18.844
<v Speaker 2>but the majority of people in Parkland </v>
<v Speaker 2>are pretty liberal and pretty classic </v>

291
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:22.804
<v Speaker 2>liberal and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why you'll see a lot of the </v>

292
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.850
<v Speaker 2>activism to come out of snowmen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas was less,</v>

293
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

294
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.440
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

295
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.830
<v Speaker 2>it was very gun control related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

296
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.521
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

297
00:13:34.521 --> 00:13:35.354
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to that in a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously so much has happened </v>

298
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:41.240
<v Speaker 2>in the spotlight that has been put on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys and everything else and,</v>

299
00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:45.320
<v Speaker 2>and several of you have stepped into it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's probably a good part</v>

300
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.163
<v Speaker 2>of that and bad parts of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably why you were </v>

301
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:48.740
<v Speaker 2>here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Double Edge Sword.</v>

302
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

303
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 2>So it ends now what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell you.</v>

304
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:55.810
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could walk out of this room,</v>

305
00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

306
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine that.</v>

307
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.070
<v Speaker 2>So we ran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ran with our hands up,</v>

308
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 2>we sat outside for a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

309
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.220
<v Speaker 2>I was able to go on a city bus with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>little brother's class to the Marriott,</v>

310
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.530
<v Speaker 2>which is the hotel only hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Parkland,</v>

311
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 2>and so they weren't letting parents come</v>
<v Speaker 2>no to the parents were coming to pick us</v>

312
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:16.714
<v Speaker 2>up at the hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were a lot of different ways </v>

313
00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:20.080
<v Speaker 2>students got out of the school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different places.</v>

314
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:22.330
<v Speaker 2>They went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kids I know just ran,</v>

315
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.513
<v Speaker 2>which was understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normally when there's a mass shooting </v>

316
00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 2>nearby you run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

317
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 2>my brother and I were at the Marriott </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hotel and our father picked us up,</v>

318
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.710
<v Speaker 2>took us over an hour to get home </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

319
00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:38.380
<v Speaker 2>as I'm sure you can understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the streets were very jammed.</v>

320
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.551
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the shooting,</v>

321
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Parkland was a no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

322
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.220
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't mad max and arche where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was wearing leather spikes,</v>

323
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.770
<v Speaker 2>but it was a no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

324
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 2>it was as if time and space had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspended.</v>

325
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.850
<v Speaker 2>The rules of physics and matter didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really exist.</v>

326
00:14:55.851 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 2>It was eerie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was seven days,</v>

327
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:00.854
<v Speaker 2>at least for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was when that period of really </v>

328
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:08.351
<v Speaker 2>surreal fear with existed that nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt real.</v>

329
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.293
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

330
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.313
<v Speaker 2>the news was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the most we got was somebody </v>

331
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 2>at the sunset and we'll talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>our production of fiddler on the roof,</v>

332
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.833
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

333
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.143
<v Speaker 1>did you in that period?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure it's very hard to even </v>

334
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:26.130
<v Speaker 1>remember it clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have a real chance to mourn,</v>

335
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.110
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

336
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.083
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can maybe let me know how close you </v>

337
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 1>were to maybe some of the students </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems like,</v>

338
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:33.584
<v Speaker 1>and I think this was part of the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the way we deal with these things </v>

339
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 1>is that we go from the incident to </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately,</v>

340
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:42.800
<v Speaker 1>especially on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just attacking each other and destroying</v>

341
00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:43.634
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you guys all get thrust into the </v>

342
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.550
<v Speaker 1>spotlight and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

343
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 1>this would be hard on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on an adult,</v>

344
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossibly hard.</v>

345
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.853
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile you have these kids who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>now out there talking about these </v>

346
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:55.820
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These kids need to mourn.</v>

347
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.923
<v Speaker 1>We need to figure out what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>with life and find some reality and </v>

348
00:15:59.651 --> 00:16:00.484
<v Speaker 1>decency.</v>

349
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.413
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's really no formula </v>

350
00:16:03.281 --> 00:16:07.210
<v Speaker 2>for recovering for from a mass shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when at a school,</v>

351
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean enough of happened that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to develop a precedence,</v>

352
00:16:11.411 --> 00:16:15.340
<v Speaker 2>which is a horrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's really nowhere to look.</v>

353
00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:17.410
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have hidden away.</v>

354
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:20.620
<v Speaker 2>I could have locked myself in my room </v>
<v Speaker 2>for weeks and maybe that would have been</v>

355
00:16:20.621 --> 00:16:22.480
<v Speaker 2>the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have.</v>

356
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.430
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what to do and my way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>coping has always been doing something.</v>

357
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I had dealt with some tragic loss this </v>
<v Speaker 2>past year and I had the.</v>

358
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.533
<v Speaker 2>There were some really dark things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to people that I loved and the </v>

359
00:16:35.981 --> 00:16:37.930
<v Speaker 2>way I always handled them was by doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

360
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:38.764
<v Speaker 2>I never liked to have a clear head </v>
<v Speaker 2>because while I think it's important to </v>

361
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:44.880
<v Speaker 2>process your pain and deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that the.</v>

362
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.173
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something like that happens and I do </v>

363
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:49.720
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to forget myself.</v>

364
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I had survivor guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

365
00:16:51.671 --> 00:16:52.504
<v Speaker 2>Why should I have left that day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were 15 year old girls that were </v>

366
00:16:55.451 --> 00:16:56.284
<v Speaker 2>murdered and I made it out and if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have pressed a button to trade my </v>

367
00:16:59.771 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 2>life for theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

368
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.410
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't have even been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

369
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should say goodbye to people.</v>

370
00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

371
00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:07.750
<v Speaker 2>I would have broken my finger pressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to heart.</v>

372
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.943
<v Speaker 2>So what made me deserve life when other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who did nothing wrong it people </v>

373
00:17:13.121 --> 00:17:14.850
<v Speaker 2>more innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more kind than I am.</v>

374
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Didn't get to make it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized while I'm alive and,</v>

375
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.470
<v Speaker 2>and one of my mentors wasn't Scott </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eagle,</v>

376
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.200
<v Speaker 2>one of the nicest guys I've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the reason that I'm a snarky little</v>

377
00:17:26.201 --> 00:17:28.240
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I develop that from him.</v>

378
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:29.163
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't make it out there and he's </v>

379
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.493
<v Speaker 2>somebody who changed the young people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives by making them better and making </v>

380
00:17:35.591 --> 00:17:37.030
<v Speaker 2>them more proud of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

381
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.840
<v Speaker 2>so what makes me as what has me </v>
<v Speaker 2>deserving of this.</v>

382
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a very religious or spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

383
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.530
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

384
00:17:44.531 --> 00:17:47.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think there was some great plan</v>
<v Speaker 2>that got me out of school,</v>

385
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:48.603
<v Speaker 2>but I think that I had a responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a responsibility to do right by the </v>

386
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:53.514
<v Speaker 2>people we lost and to do what I thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>would make the world a better place </v>

387
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 2>while they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there were marriages that didn't</v>

388
00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.244
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were people who would have had </v>

389
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 2>children and didn't get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

390
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.133
<v Speaker 2>it's a horrible thing to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day lives ended </v>

391
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 2>and I still had mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said after the shooting,</v>

392
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 2>what I'm going to do is something.</v>

393
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.520
<v Speaker 2>And I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

394
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I've been a big liberal most of my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

395
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 2>and I've always been an advocate for gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

396
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.263
<v Speaker 2>I was a big debater of other students </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the shooting in Las Vegas where I </v>

397
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:27.714
<v Speaker 2>said nobody needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were wearing a point in our </v>

398
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:31.014
<v Speaker 2>society where we're advanced enough that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody needs an assault weapon to take </v>

399
00:18:33.511 --> 00:18:35.250
<v Speaker 2>care of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the,</v>

400
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.330
<v Speaker 2>look at the way these guns are made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can defend ourselves in hand.</v>

401
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father has multiple in the house.</v>

402
00:18:41.311 --> 00:18:44.640
<v Speaker 2>He's a reserve police officer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was Miami shores for awhile.</v>

403
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.683
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I instantly said the thing we can do </v>

404
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.770
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop folks like the shooter at my school</v>

405
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:50.604
<v Speaker 2>from getting these weapons because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a 19 year old who if he had spent </v>

406
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 2>five minutes with the psychologist would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been sent to a therapist,</v>

407
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:58.950
<v Speaker 2>not a gun store.</v>

408
00:18:59.040 --> 00:18:59.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

409
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:00.474
<v Speaker 1>So let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we get specifically to far down </v>

410
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 1>the road here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which obviously we're going to touch on.</v>

411
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.323
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are trying to more and you </v>

412
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.060
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're having survivor guilt.</v>

413
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:09.894
<v Speaker 1>All of these things I'm sure just in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your family and your brother and </v>

414
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:16.320
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just I can't even imagine then the media</v>

415
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.870
<v Speaker 1>because I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to hit media stuff before we get</v>

416
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:21.090
<v Speaker 1>to the gun part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The media then descend.</v>

417
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.920
<v Speaker 1>What was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

418
00:19:22.921 --> 00:19:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I assume everybody and their brother was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to reach out to all of you guys.</v>

419
00:19:27.091 --> 00:19:29.130
<v Speaker 1>They were putting you guys on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

420
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I probably even that very day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

421
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.630
<v Speaker 1>what was that like for you guys</v>

422
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.160
<v Speaker 2>or for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

423
00:19:36.161 --> 00:19:37.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>

424
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.103
<v Speaker 2>our whole situation with the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be anything from CNN to Fox </v>

425
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.870
<v Speaker 2>News to Ellen was a double edge sword </v>
<v Speaker 2>because on the one,</v>

426
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:45.763
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand there are bodies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are warm and right here on TV and in </v>

427
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.030
<v Speaker 2>retrospect I might have done that </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

428
00:19:52.031 --> 00:19:53.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

429
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.160
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't let this be like Sandy Hook </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

430
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.680
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't let this be people coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>in to film crying,</v>

431
00:19:59.681 --> 00:20:02.830
<v Speaker 2>mothers talking about how bad these guns</v>
<v Speaker 2>are and leave.</v>

432
00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to get out there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

433
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

434
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.900
<v Speaker 2>how many of these do we need before we </v>
<v Speaker 2>do something that I don't.</v>

435
00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:10.743
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want people to see Parkland as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a place where everybody was crying and </v>

436
00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:14.524
<v Speaker 2>everybody was throwing a pity party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to people to see Parkland as a </v>

437
00:20:16.991 --> 00:20:20.020
<v Speaker 2>place where a terrible tragedy happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the city stood up and said,</v>

438
00:20:20.021 --> 00:20:20.854
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to be like these other </v>

439
00:20:22.181 --> 00:20:22.570
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>

440
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.350
<v Speaker 2>We are going to be a catalyst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

441
00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.320
<v Speaker 2>before before Stoneman Douglas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would send.</v>

442
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.263
<v Speaker 2>I would hear the word sandy hook in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>room and everybody would get quiet and </v>

443
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.790
<v Speaker 2>it would be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't have that be stoneman Douglas</v>

444
00:20:33.791 --> 00:20:35.620
<v Speaker 2>at this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my school.</v>

445
00:20:35.621 --> 00:20:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I loved my school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a big school spirit fellow.</v>

446
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.633
<v Speaker 2>It was about to become a statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about to become that one dark </v>

447
00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:46.390
<v Speaker 2>thing that somebody will make a joke </v>
<v Speaker 2>about or somebody will say something bad</v>

448
00:20:46.391 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Speaker 2>about or really anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got out there and said no.</v>

449
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.870
<v Speaker 2>And so many people got out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

450
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 2>this cannot be another example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

451
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Everybody crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not here to cry.</v>

452
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 2>We're here to tell you what we can do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make this a better world.</v>

453
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Were there people swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

454
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.550
<v Speaker 1>advisors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever,</v>

455
00:21:06.551 --> 00:21:09.460
<v Speaker 1>that were kind of guiding you through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the media part of this?</v>

456
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Because there were so many strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments where it seemed like,</v>

457
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:13.773
<v Speaker 1>like I said to you right before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make this about any </v>

458
00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:16.444
<v Speaker 1>specific student especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to throw anyone out on </v>

459
00:21:18.401 --> 00:21:19.234
<v Speaker 1>the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we see someone like David Hogg </v>

460
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:23.030
<v Speaker 1>who obviously is very public now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

461
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying things that didn't quite seem </v>

462
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.120
<v Speaker 1>right or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or talking about laws and all this stuff</v>

463
00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:29.954
<v Speaker 1>like going from just surviving to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly advocacy with almost no space </v>

464
00:21:35.141 --> 00:21:36.500
<v Speaker 1>in between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:37.923
<v Speaker 2>in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the general idea of going right </v>

466
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:40.534
<v Speaker 2>to advocacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while it might not have been our best </v>

467
00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 2>call to immediately go to it was these </v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras are only here for so long and we</v>

468
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:48.250
<v Speaker 2>couldn't have them leave a double edged </v>
<v Speaker 2>sword.</v>

469
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do we,</v>

470
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.823
<v Speaker 2>do we wait our respectful time and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and advocate or what people not </v>

471
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:58.630
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think I stand by advocacy.</v>

472
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think on a moral level I might not but</v>

473
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:04.150
<v Speaker 2>on a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But generally,</v>

474
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:06.520
<v Speaker 2>I think that while everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking,</v>

475
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 2>we had to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

476
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.330
<v Speaker 2>let's look at what we really want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at here.</v>

477
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.850
<v Speaker 2>These like give these families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's</v>

478
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:14.763
<v Speaker 1>base were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were any of you guys afraid that you </v>

479
00:22:15.981 --> 00:22:16.814
<v Speaker 1>were being looked at as experts suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>where as horrific as what happened to </v>

480
00:22:20.571 --> 00:22:24.500
<v Speaker 1>you was it doesn't make you an expert </v>
<v Speaker 1>either in law or in guns or any of those</v>

481
00:22:24.501 --> 00:22:27.110
<v Speaker 1>things like you can very eloquently as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing right now.</v>

482
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Tell me your story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what you think.</v>

483
00:22:29.241 --> 00:22:31.370
<v Speaker 1>All of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But especially at the beginning,</v>

484
00:22:31.371 --> 00:22:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know way more now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know everything.</v>

485
00:22:34.641 --> 00:22:35.474
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were throwing a bunch of 17 </v>

486
00:22:37.521 --> 00:22:40.520
<v Speaker 1>year olds out there as if they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts on all of these things.</v>

487
00:22:40.521 --> 00:22:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And I think that also added to some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

488
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.210
<v Speaker 1>the tumbled around everything.</v>

489
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Well at the time it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

490
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

491
00:22:48.151 --> 00:22:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt phenomenal.</v>

492
00:22:49.621 --> 00:22:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I was somebody that everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking to as if I,</v>

493
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.080
<v Speaker 2>as if I knew everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I said before,</v>

494
00:22:55.081 --> 00:22:58.800
<v Speaker 2>that was what I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't a good feeling.</v>

495
00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest with you,</v>

496
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 2>some things about it felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it felt like a terrible</v>

497
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.440
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just said it's awesome and it wasn't</v>

498
00:23:06.441 --> 00:23:08.060
<v Speaker 1>a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That probably sums it up,</v>

499
00:23:08.061 --> 00:23:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

500
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was awesome to me that I got to the.</v>

501
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I spent my whole life watching people </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about laws and watching people talk</v>

502
00:23:16.821 --> 00:23:20.810
<v Speaker 2>about politics and now I got to say this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my word got to be respected.</v>

503
00:23:20.811 --> 00:23:23.240
<v Speaker 2>But every time I went out there I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought there are people then.</v>

504
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.300
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

505
00:23:26.301 --> 00:23:26.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

506
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a moral qualm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I out here at,</v>

507
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:30.613
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this because I believe in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm doing this because I don't want </v>

508
00:23:32.781 --> 00:23:35.120
<v Speaker 2>the world to lose people again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

509
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody deserves to be shot.</v>

510
00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.453
<v Speaker 2>Nobody at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody who's a good person deserves to </v>

511
00:23:40.851 --> 00:23:42.680
<v Speaker 2>be shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

512
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

513
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.660
<v Speaker 2>it was difficult for me because on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one hand,</v>

514
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:51.620
<v Speaker 2>it was this amazing feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my voice.</v>

515
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.573
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you what you all need to </v>

516
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:56.150
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what everybody needed to hear was we</v>

517
00:23:56.151 --> 00:23:57.080
<v Speaker 2>need to pass gun laws.</v>

518
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.080
<v Speaker 2>It's been enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

519
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.070
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people did nothing after columbine,</v>

520
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I would have understood it because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was supposed to be an anomaly.</v>

521
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a shocker.</v>

522
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:08.300
<v Speaker 2>And then stoneman Douglas happened and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was more of an,</v>

523
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.470
<v Speaker 2>another not a woe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

524
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.710
<v Speaker 2>so it felt it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt great that people were carrying.</v>

525
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:16.873
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was what I would say it was the </v>

526
00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:20.000
<v Speaker 2>awesome part was that I was afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody would.</v>

527
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in the country would feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>helpless and cry and be done.</v>

528
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.093
<v Speaker 2>But it was amazing to see that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country was saying maybe there's </v>

529
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:30.020
<v Speaker 2>something we can do here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we can make some change.</v>

530
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.753
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that was awful was I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going from news hits two memorial </v>

531
00:24:36.651 --> 00:24:37.330
<v Speaker 2>services.</v>

532
00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've had a sort of interesting </v>

533
00:24:39.341 --> 00:24:40.174
<v Speaker 1>evolution about all this and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sort of leads to where we're </v>

534
00:24:41.891 --> 00:24:43.600
<v Speaker 1>going to end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you're doing now,</v>

535
00:24:43.601 --> 00:24:46.050
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

536
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:47.170
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

537
00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you're part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're part of the media machine.</v>

538
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.540
<v Speaker 1>You guys are trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>can you do?</v>

539
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.433
<v Speaker 1>I assume that's sort of how march for </v>
<v Speaker 1>our life started and if I'm not </v>

540
00:24:55.871 --> 00:24:57.160
<v Speaker 1>mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started in your house,</v>

541
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started in my bathroom.</v>

542
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

543
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was coming out of the shower,</v>

544
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.580
<v Speaker 1>putting on my ghostbusters PJ's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a slimer.</v>

545
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.740
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't old school ghostbusters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

546
00:25:05.741 --> 00:25:07.510
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I am.</v>

547
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.540
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about the new ghost busters </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe after this part.</v>

548
00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.060
<v Speaker 1>How much eight do you want to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>online?</v>

549
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you this.</v>

550
00:25:16.401 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in that cast is incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>talented.</v>

551
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:19.603
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like the movie very much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's really nobody who is in it </v>

552
00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:25.520
<v Speaker 2>that I think was not in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an incredibly funny person.</v>

553
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.170
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

554
00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:28.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started in my home and,</v>

555
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.593
<v Speaker 2>and I got a lot of my friends together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some I called everyone who I knew was </v>

556
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.213
<v Speaker 2>intelligent and well spoken and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to put their time to grieve </v>

557
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:41.840
<v Speaker 2>aside to demand action because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

558
00:25:41.841 --> 00:25:42.674
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it was in some ways public </v>
<v Speaker 2>service because people are grieving and </v>

559
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 2>we're out here saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna.</v>

560
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Put that aside as as much as I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cry every day and mind you,</v>

561
00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I really want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did a lot.</v>

562
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.340
<v Speaker 2>I knew that I had to put that aside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to do something so I got everybody</v>

563
00:25:58.341 --> 00:25:59.174
<v Speaker 2>that I knew could do something to mostly</v>
<v Speaker 2>my drama friends because I knew that </v>

564
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 2>they could speak and we all got together</v>
<v Speaker 2>at my house and said,</v>

565
00:26:04.701 --> 00:26:07.190
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we do with this whole,</v>

566
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.120
<v Speaker 2>this whole country?</v>

567
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.630
<v Speaker 2>People on both sides or all morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

568
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.530
<v Speaker 2>How can we get everybody on both sides </v>
<v Speaker 2>together to do something now?</v>

569
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't happen.</v>

570
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Getting people on both sides didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really happen.</v>

571
00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.753
<v Speaker 2>That can be a tough one and it is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough one and then it will always be a </v>

572
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:24.764
<v Speaker 2>tough one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that needs to be </v>

573
00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

574
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:29.630
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

575
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 2>from my home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were sleeping two hours a night.</v>

576
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I would go entire days only eating one </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein bar,</v>

577
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:36.254
<v Speaker 2>not even realizing we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was such a tornado that we were </v>

578
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:41.534
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all kind of forgot what it was like </v>

579
00:26:42.951 --> 00:26:43.784
<v Speaker 2>to be a normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you come up with the idea for March </v>

580
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:48.990
<v Speaker 2>for our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

581
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.820
<v Speaker 2>get us to that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was it supposed to be?</v>

582
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.430
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the actual original intentions</v>

583
00:26:56.431 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 2>beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not forget about this.</v>

584
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Original intentions were let's get gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>control passed and I'm still a big,</v>

585
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 2>let's get gun control pass guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

586
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:08.663
<v Speaker 2>and that's what we wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to say everybody out here </v>

587
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:11.581
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should do this.</v>

588
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Let's get everyone together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

589
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 2>let's get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big march together where people say,</v>

590
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.980
<v Speaker 2>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming all the way out here.</v>

591
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing out here today to demand </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

592
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.490
<v Speaker 2>And seeing everybody together was </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

593
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:27.893
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

594
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.080
<v Speaker 2>you get getting up on the stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing all those people.</v>

595
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care about the being in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of him.</v>

596
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a drama kid,</v>

597
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I stood in front of people and taught </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the past five years,</v>

598
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.510
<v Speaker 2>but I saw all those people and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people believe in something.</v>

599
00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.440
<v Speaker 2>The these people come from different </v>
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>

600
00:27:46.441 --> 00:27:48.420
<v Speaker 2>These people that are all completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

601
00:27:48.421 --> 00:27:49.254
<v Speaker 2>but they're all together because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in one thing and that was </v>

602
00:27:51.391 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 2>magical and I don't use the word magical</v>
<v Speaker 2>very often.</v>

603
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was magical and it was.</v>

604
00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing to see.</v>

605
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.640
<v Speaker 2>But from the beginning of our advocate </v>
<v Speaker 2>advocacy to the march,</v>

606
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:04.763
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of personalities together </v>

607
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 2>and we were able to make it through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain we felt together.</v>

608
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so often people said,</v>

609
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:16.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you guys at your school got shot</v>

610
00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:18.720
<v Speaker 2>up a month ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your school got shot up three weeks ago.</v>

611
00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 2>Why are you smiling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

612
00:28:20.521 --> 00:28:21.354
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least from my own personal </v>

613
00:28:22.981 --> 00:28:23.814
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the teacher that I was dear friends </v>

614
00:28:25.651 --> 00:28:26.490
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I lost.</v>

615
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Scott wouldn't want me to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott would want me to do something.</v>

616
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.080
<v Speaker 2>Scott would want me to do what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed in.</v>

617
00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:36.570
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a very political guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will,</v>

618
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.670
<v Speaker 2>after the shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably wouldn't have focused on any</v>

619
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:39.504
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have focused on getting </v>

620
00:28:40.651 --> 00:28:42.540
<v Speaker 2>everybody at Douglas to feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to laugh,</v>

621
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:43.374
<v Speaker 2>to smile.</v>

622
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.170
<v Speaker 2>But if I believed in something and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to advocate for it,</v>

623
00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I knew that if he were here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd say,</v>

624
00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:48.414
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go do it.</v>

625
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.153
<v Speaker 2>So the time I spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting at his memorial and I was </v>

626
00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:54.370
<v Speaker 2>crying and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

627
00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.220
<v Speaker 2>it was in the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was all snotty.</v>

628
00:28:56.221 --> 00:28:57.054
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to wipe my face and my dirty </v>

629
00:28:58.141 --> 00:28:58.974
<v Speaker 2>hands and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was what many would consider the low </v>

630
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:04.470
<v Speaker 2>point in a movie when the person feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they've lost everything.</v>

631
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:09.630
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought about it and if Scott</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoda to behind me as a ghost,</v>

632
00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:10.980
<v Speaker 2>which he and I used to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

633
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I used to talk about Yoda Ang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he yoda behind me and he would say,</v>

634
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Cameron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something.</v>

635
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:19.554
<v Speaker 2>You must.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to talk to me in Yoda voice a </v>

636
00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:21.894
<v Speaker 2>lot and not go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were going to get your Yoda </v>

637
00:29:23.341 --> 00:29:24.510
<v Speaker 2>impression there and it's not gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

638
00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:25.623
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else has the exclusive on that </v>

639
00:29:27.421 --> 00:29:28.670
<v Speaker 2>one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

640
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>there were points where Scott was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher in fifth grade.</v>

641
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.950
<v Speaker 2>He Yoda voice to me while I was asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>him a genuine question,</v>

642
00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 2>which frustrated me a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's time.</v>

643
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.840
<v Speaker 2>I could do a three hour interview on </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

644
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 2>but he would said do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

645
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.280
<v Speaker 2>so when we were all smiling together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were all laughing together,</v>

646
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:46.114
<v Speaker 2>it was because I knew that somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love would have wanted me to and we </v>

647
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:50.620
<v Speaker 2>had each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

648
00:29:50.621 --> 00:29:51.454
<v Speaker 2>If I were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was advocating for gun control </v>

649
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:53.830
<v Speaker 2>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't have worked.</v>

650
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Not only because I couldn't have done it</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>

651
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.063
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good enough to do it alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also because we were each other's </v>

652
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:02.110
<v Speaker 2>lifeline when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

653
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.003
<v Speaker 2>when everything seemed awful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything seemed like the world was </v>

654
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 2>this dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible place.</v>

655
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.950
<v Speaker 2>I had my friends around me to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were here for you.</v>

656
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.690
<v Speaker 2>We've got this together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

657
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people's shoulder.</v>

658
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Many people were in my shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more emotional than many.</v>

659
00:30:18.281 --> 00:30:19.114
<v Speaker 2>I'm a theater student.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So more people had to help me that I </v>

660
00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:21.484
<v Speaker 2>need to help them and feel beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional part and getting everybody </v>

661
00:30:27.191 --> 00:30:28.180
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you said,</v>

662
00:30:28.181 --> 00:30:30.010
<v Speaker 2>you're still a gun control advocate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

663
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.903
<v Speaker 2>I sent that part of what happened around</v>
<v Speaker 2>March for our labs was you saw things </v>

664
00:30:35.171 --> 00:30:39.550
<v Speaker 2>getting bizarrely political or or more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than perhaps you were.</v>

665
00:30:39.551 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 2>You guys wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that fair to say?</v>

666
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.320
<v Speaker 2>I think what march for our lives should </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

667
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:48.220
<v Speaker 2>See it's a political issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the way it should have come off,</v>

668
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.400
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is what everybody I </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked with believes.</v>

669
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I know that for a fact is that kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to get shot.</v>

670
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what we are at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

671
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 2>We are kids who are out here saying we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to die.</v>

672
00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.090
<v Speaker 2>And back then I thought that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't believe in gun control beliefs,</v>

673
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:04.060
<v Speaker 2>you didn't care if kids died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned that that's not the case,</v>

674
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.870
<v Speaker 2>but that's a pretty interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution for someone at 17 to have with</v>

675
00:31:08.871 --> 00:31:09.704
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

676
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.330
<v Speaker 2>five or six months I spoke to people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with me.</v>

677
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I learned that they want the country to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a better place,</v>

678
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:15.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they might not agree on how we </v>

679
00:31:17.471 --> 00:31:19.800
<v Speaker 2>might think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might think that their views are horse</v>

680
00:31:19.801 --> 00:31:22.740
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every.</v>

681
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:23.883
<v Speaker 2>We all agree on basically 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and I'm sure there are plenty of </v>

682
00:31:26.831 --> 00:31:28.570
<v Speaker 2>political things you and I will disagree</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

683
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:29.643
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Mcfarland is one of the most gifted </v>

684
00:31:31.361 --> 00:31:33.280
<v Speaker 2>spiderman writers to agree on that.</v>

685
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever do anything with DC?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more of a marvel guy,</v>

686
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:38.830
<v Speaker 2>but I had a pretty good Batman </v>
<v Speaker 2>collection for awhile.</v>

687
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Nightwing is my favorite superhero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're familiar.</v>

688
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:42.274
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in comic books they're very </v>

689
00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:45.214
<v Speaker 2>afraid to make real change and nightwing</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually was able to make it through </v>

690
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:47.981
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

691
00:31:47.981 --> 00:31:48.400
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

692
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.233
<v Speaker 2>if a robin became his own superhero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally that would only be for 10 </v>

693
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.220
<v Speaker 2>issues and then he'd go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But night we actually made that jump.</v>

694
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.560
<v Speaker 2>I encourage you all to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going back,</v>

695
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.420
<v Speaker 2>we can focus on Mcfarlane Spiderman from</v>
<v Speaker 2>to 98 to 3:35.</v>

696
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.633
<v Speaker 2>That the idea of venom is brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw the movie trailer for the </v>

697
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:07.900
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about that off camera.</v>

698
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds good.</v>

699
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Tom Hardy's gifted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

700
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.693
<v Speaker 2>so the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way people should have seen us in </v>

701
00:32:14.321 --> 00:32:17.550
<v Speaker 2>the way I failed really in the messaging</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was so deeply involved with it</v>

702
00:32:17.551 --> 00:32:18.384
<v Speaker 2>was we just don't want to get killed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly because of the perfect storm of </v>

703
00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 2>everything it became left versus right.</v>

704
00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.493
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think anybody in my group </v>

705
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:30.514
<v Speaker 2>wanted that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody in my group wants </v>

706
00:32:31.901 --> 00:32:32.734
<v Speaker 2>that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's in one way the media is the </v>

707
00:32:35.891 --> 00:32:39.410
<v Speaker 2>media's portrayal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in one way my personal inability to</v>

708
00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:42.350
<v Speaker 2>express it correctly and another way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my arrogance,</v>

709
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.380
<v Speaker 2>because I was pretty arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that from the bottom of my heart.</v>

710
00:32:47.481 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody else I worked with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>march for our lives was a,</v>

711
00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.693
<v Speaker 2>a kid who wanted to help the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was a cocky little son of a bitch </v>

712
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that translated a lot because I said</v>

713
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

714
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.193
<v Speaker 2>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything I say about gun control is </v>

715
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:05.810
<v Speaker 2>completely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

716
00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.100
<v Speaker 2>so why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't,</v>

717
00:33:07.101 --> 00:33:07.934
<v Speaker 2>why aren't you listening to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm obviously in the right here </v>

718
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.573
<v Speaker 2>and everybody else again was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was basically saying I don't want to </v>

719
00:33:15.111 --> 00:33:15.500
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

720
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Here's how I think it could work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I said,</v>

721
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm right politically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my political movement.</v>

722
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Listened to my politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my fault.</v>

723
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm playing myself.</v>

724
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.203
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid who lost friends and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that this is what we needed and </v>

725
00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I still do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my,</v>

726
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.740
<v Speaker 2>my big error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my what?</v>

727
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:36.020
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the word from a tragic hero?</v>

728
00:33:36.021 --> 00:33:37.550
<v Speaker 2>That's their flaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamartia.</v>

729
00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Hubris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

730
00:33:39.381 --> 00:33:40.880
<v Speaker 2>this is your Hubris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>

731
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's call it the Hubris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I again,</v>

732
00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:44.024
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take ap Lang or ap lit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you my favorite tragic </v>

733
00:33:47.271 --> 00:33:48.680
<v Speaker 2>heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love tragic heroes,</v>

734
00:33:48.681 --> 00:33:50.780
<v Speaker 2>but my hubris was an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

735
00:33:50.781 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I could be interpreting this wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought I was right.</v>

736
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:58.600
<v Speaker 2>I thought that anybody who didn't agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me because I was so right,</v>

737
00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:03.290
<v Speaker 2>wanted kids to die one percent of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

738
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.213
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that.</v>

739
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.150
<v Speaker 2>My guess is that three percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country doesn't care when kids die three</v>

740
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just as not my kid or you know,</v>

741
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:13.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not where I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the rest of the country doesn't want</v>

742
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:15.560
<v Speaker 2>kids to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

743
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.113
<v Speaker 2>I learned about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that family in Texas where the mom and </v>

744
00:34:19.521 --> 00:34:22.550
<v Speaker 2>the dad both carry weapons because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanna protect their family.</v>

745
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:23.833
<v Speaker 2>I learned about the people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in everywhere who want to protect their </v>

746
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:29.024
<v Speaker 2>families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have guns in my house and while I </v>

747
00:34:30.531 --> 00:34:33.740
<v Speaker 2>believe in an assault weapons ban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least much more restrictive laws,</v>

748
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.310
<v Speaker 2>if you want to hurt my autistic brother </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have a gun,</v>

749
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.940
<v Speaker 2>you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you see</v>

750
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Speaker 1>someone like David Hogg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm only mentioning him because he's</v>

751
00:34:42.801 --> 00:34:43.940
<v Speaker 1>been so vocal on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

752
00:34:43.941 --> 00:34:44.774
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to talk about ideas and not </v>

753
00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:46.574
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you see someone like him </v>

754
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:49.760
<v Speaker 1>tweeting all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

755
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get an exact quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossed up here,</v>

756
00:34:53.631 --> 00:34:56.150
<v Speaker 1>but to the effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't agree with me,</v>

757
00:34:56.151 --> 00:34:58.670
<v Speaker 1>you want dead kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans want dead kids.</v>

758
00:34:58.671 --> 00:35:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Marco Rubio doesn't want to save </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

759
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.383
<v Speaker 1>All of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you now realize that's just not the way </v>

760
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.630
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not true and it's not.</v>

761
00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not actually effective.</v>

762
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.130
<v Speaker 2>The reason I criticize myself and not my</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

763
00:35:12.131 --> 00:35:14.740
<v Speaker 2>because I know David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David is a dear friend of mine.</v>

764
00:35:14.741 --> 00:35:15.574
<v Speaker 2>I've known him for a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've only known him really well </v>

765
00:35:17.951 --> 00:35:19.900
<v Speaker 2>since the shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a class with him once.</v>

766
00:35:19.901 --> 00:35:22.540
<v Speaker 2>He was nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything David does,</v>

767
00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:23.523
<v Speaker 2>and I know we're not talking specifics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll just use David as an example </v>

768
00:35:25.721 --> 00:35:28.240
<v Speaker 2>because much like everybody else in </v>
<v Speaker 2>March for our lives,</v>

769
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.343
<v Speaker 2>everything David does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does because he wants the country to </v>

770
00:35:31.391 --> 00:35:32.224
<v Speaker 2>be a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and I don't always see perfectly Idi </v>

771
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.463
<v Speaker 2>on what exactly to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every time I something he tweets </v>

772
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 2>that I don't like and I looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about it and I say,</v>

773
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I've spent hours with David.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known him.</v>

774
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I know him so incredibly well because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this dark,</v>

775
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.283
<v Speaker 2>tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible bond that was really created </v>

776
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:51.894
<v Speaker 2>after the worst case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when David says something that I </v>

777
00:35:54.181 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 2>don't agree with you saying it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't want another kid to die.</v>

778
00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.880
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>messaging with everybody in the group is</v>

779
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.240
<v Speaker 2>occasionally not really in sync.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We agree.</v>

780
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.133
<v Speaker 2>We disagree on things sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I thought that people in March </v>

781
00:36:06.961 --> 00:36:11.700
<v Speaker 2>for our lives like David or anyone was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this for the wrong reasons,</v>

782
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.530
<v Speaker 2>I would be instant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would instantly call them out.</v>

783
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the case.</v>

784
00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:16.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately the road to hell is paved </v>

785
00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:18.860
<v Speaker 1>with good intentions and I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

786
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.130
<v Speaker 1>SMIRCH has intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fine.</v>

787
00:36:21.131 --> 00:36:21.964
<v Speaker 1>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you that his intentions are </v>

788
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:25.490
<v Speaker 1>pure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I of course,</v>

789
00:36:25.491 --> 00:36:26.324
<v Speaker 1>I believe that</v>

790
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.313
<v Speaker 2>David's a guy who cares so deeply about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world around him and we'll do </v>

791
00:36:29.641 --> 00:36:31.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever it takes to make it a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

792
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.063
<v Speaker 2>But it's funny that you say the road to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell is paved with good intentions </v>

793
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.763
<v Speaker 2>because our summer tour where we went </v>
<v Speaker 2>around advocating for more voter </v>

794
00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:39.714
<v Speaker 2>registration and more accessible voting </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the country was called road to </v>

795
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:42.954
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a counter protester I one </v>

796
00:36:45.211 --> 00:36:47.490
<v Speaker 2>of our events that said more like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road to hell.</v>

797
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.153
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

798
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.483
<v Speaker 2>that's not very nice.</v>

799
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after the march,</v>

800
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.440
<v Speaker 1>during the march,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the march,</v>

801
00:36:53.441 --> 00:36:56.270
<v Speaker 1>this thing is just becoming more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more political.</v>

802
00:36:56.271 --> 00:36:57.104
<v Speaker 1>As you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are getting up there and you </v>

803
00:36:58.131 --> 00:36:59.120
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

804
00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:00.163
<v Speaker 1>sort of have your moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are certain issues you don't </v>

805
00:37:01.971 --> 00:37:05.360
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're politicians reaching out to you.</v>

806
00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that,</v>

807
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle [inaudible] shoe of his talk to </v>

808
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Marco Rubio a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

809
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:12.303
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how deep did this go in terms of </v>

810
00:37:13.521 --> 00:37:16.220
<v Speaker 1>reaching every part of American society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

811
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.140
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

812
00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:20.410
<v Speaker 2>we reached out to a lot of people and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people reached out to us.</v>

813
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.820
<v Speaker 2>There were a lot of conservatives that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

814
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.823
<v Speaker 2>we were speaking to about the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple friends who went to gun </v>

815
00:37:26.801 --> 00:37:27.634
<v Speaker 2>groups to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat down with some very big gun </v>

816
00:37:30.431 --> 00:37:31.264
<v Speaker 2>advocates in their areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really in the country but notable </v>

817
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:39.150
<v Speaker 2>where they were to talk about the issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know that the rest of my group was</v>

818
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.030
<v Speaker 2>really interested in opening up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this.</v>

819
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.133
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the shitty one in March for our </v>

820
00:37:44.831 --> 00:37:47.470
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to stir some shit.</v>

821
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to cause trouble.</v>

822
00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:50.523
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to own the conservatives the </v>

823
00:37:52.751 --> 00:37:54.940
<v Speaker 2>same way a lot of conservatives want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>own the libs.</v>

824
00:37:54.941 --> 00:37:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what it's about right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

825
00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.250
<v Speaker 2>people play games where they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to one up each other and you know,</v>

826
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to do that.</v>

827
00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.733
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to make politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like look bad as opposed to </v>

828
00:38:05.591 --> 00:38:08.320
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can we do when I went up there</v>

829
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.980
<v Speaker 1>and I was where your folks or anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

830
00:38:10.981 --> 00:38:13.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe ease up on twitter or like,</v>

831
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just because you're going to get no</v>

832
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:16.224
<v Speaker 1>matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if everything you said was </v>

833
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:18.960
<v Speaker 1>factually right and came from the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and all that,</v>

834
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.350
<v Speaker 1>just the amount of hate you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get while you're still a young person in</v>

835
00:38:22.351 --> 00:38:24.000
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it cannot be fun.</v>

836
00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:24.963
<v Speaker 2>My mom is her sole existence in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is to make everybody in the world </v>

837
00:38:31.031 --> 00:38:33.340
<v Speaker 2>happy and love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she said to me,</v>

838
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:36.310
<v Speaker 2>be nice and loving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad,</v>

839
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.980
<v Speaker 2>who is a bit of a political advocate </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>

840
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 2>agrees with me on a lot of things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes he would tell me to ease up.</v>

841
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes he would tell me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.250
<v Speaker 2>be be a little bit rougher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he also said,</v>

843
00:38:48.251 --> 00:38:50.950
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I think my parenting </v>
<v Speaker 2>from my mom,</v>

844
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Stepdad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad step mom was so great,</v>

845
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:57.250
<v Speaker 2>was they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do what you think is right and don't let</v>

846
00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.010
<v Speaker 2>people put their hooks in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did.</v>

847
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I let I let I let people manipulate me a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bid because I,</v>

848
00:39:03.581 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I thought that they were kindred </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirits.</v>

849
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents,</v>

850
00:39:07.031 --> 00:39:08.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky enough to have parents who </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

851
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.690
<v Speaker 2>believe what you believe if my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

852
00:39:10.691 --> 00:39:12.250
<v Speaker 2>my parents are all liberal.</v>

853
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.670
<v Speaker 2>But if I came home and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

854
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.713
<v Speaker 2>if I came home with a trump 20 slash 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I do not expect to do unless some </v>

855
00:39:17.921 --> 00:39:21.460
<v Speaker 2>drastic change happens in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I know you're not thrilled with</v>

856
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.150
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats with moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

857
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:23.993
<v Speaker 2>throw the Democrats at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not thrilled with Democrats at </v>

858
00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:27.280
<v Speaker 2>the moment because they're not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>good Democrats.</v>

859
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Not because they're Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we'll get to that.</v>

860
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:31.623
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

861
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:32.583
<v Speaker 2>if I came home and I told my parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I would vote for the opposite of </v>

862
00:39:35.051 --> 00:39:35.884
<v Speaker 2>what they would vote for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would say if you're doing it </v>

863
00:39:37.571 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 2>because you think it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do it.</v>

864
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 2>And I'm very grateful for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're.</v>

865
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you stand on gun control?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally?</v>

866
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Because I think what happened was they </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the event at March for our lives,</v>

867
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:51.303
<v Speaker 2>there were a lot of people getting up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and they were saying things that </v>

868
00:39:53.081 --> 00:39:53.914
<v Speaker 2>implied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is the way a lot of </v>

869
00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:55.750
<v Speaker 2>people on the right took it.</v>

870
00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:00.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not about sensible gun control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is ultimately about taking away all</v>

871
00:40:00.401 --> 00:40:01.234
<v Speaker 2>the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that of course is the fear of most </v>

872
00:40:02.711 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 2>of the people on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were a couple of the students,</v>

873
00:40:05.171 --> 00:40:07.300
<v Speaker 2>there was one young girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who said we're going to</v>

874
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:08.134
<v Speaker 2>start with bump stocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're coming for all the guns or </v>

875
00:40:10.331 --> 00:40:11.164
<v Speaker 2>something to that effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that that feeds right into the </v>

876
00:40:13.571 --> 00:40:15.100
<v Speaker 2>people on the right who go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

877
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:19.600
<v Speaker 2>well now we're not going to talk you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys to negotiate who like better law as</v>

878
00:40:19.601 --> 00:40:21.490
<v Speaker 2>you guys are Mao Zedong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

879
00:40:21.491 --> 00:40:25.120
<v Speaker 2>And then because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the people on the left and you guys</v>

880
00:40:25.121 --> 00:40:25.954
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

881
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.640
<v Speaker 2>right now they don't want to talk at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

882
00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:28.474
<v Speaker 2>so we're not going to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you end up sort of exactly </v>

883
00:40:30.371 --> 00:40:32.190
<v Speaker 2>where we're at at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an.</v>

884
00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody told me this the other day.</v>

885
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:35.164
<v Speaker 2>It's a brilliant point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left and the right attack each </v>

886
00:40:36.941 --> 00:40:39.760
<v Speaker 2>other's worst arguments and that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing for us.</v>

887
00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to my personal stance </v>
<v Speaker 2>on guns,</v>

888
00:40:42.701 --> 00:40:43.534
<v Speaker 2>there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some differing opinions </v>

889
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:45.880
<v Speaker 2>amongst my friends from our for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>

890
00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:47.950
<v Speaker 2>but we all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all agree with some similar things.</v>

891
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.083
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that as long as people who are </v>

892
00:40:51.311 --> 00:40:54.010
<v Speaker 2>responsible can carry concealed </v>
<v Speaker 2>firearms,</v>

893
00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:58.240
<v Speaker 2>particularly handguns in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many situations,</v>

894
00:40:58.241 --> 00:40:59.074
<v Speaker 2>the country is a safer place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that there is not a strong </v>

895
00:41:01.901 --> 00:41:02.734
<v Speaker 2>vetting process for people to purchase </v>
<v Speaker 2>these firearms and a lot of people just </v>

896
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:06.334
<v Speaker 2>get guns and a lot of these people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not the good guy with the gun because I </v>

897
00:41:09.791 --> 00:41:12.580
<v Speaker 2>think the good guy with a gun argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>is just a hasty generalization.</v>

898
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:13.803
<v Speaker 2>I understand it in some ways because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>intend to concealed carry when I'm an </v>

899
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:21.961
<v Speaker 2>adult because I intended to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>family and I intend to shoot anybody who</v>

900
00:41:22.361 --> 00:41:27.361
<v Speaker 2>tries to kill my family and I assumed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that even that position right there</v>

901
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 2>probably puts you on the outs with a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

902
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of your crew.</v>

903
00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Conceptually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

904
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.480
<v Speaker 2>we respect each other's opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody in March for our lives,</v>

905
00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:37.610
<v Speaker 2>and this is nobody in our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if somebody said,</v>

906
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:40.340
<v Speaker 2>I want to eliminate all guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>

907
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.470
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's talk about that.</v>

908
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:43.663
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends respect me for what I think </v>

909
00:41:46.461 --> 00:41:48.620
<v Speaker 2>and I respect them some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult.</v>

910
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:51.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a difficult thing to respect people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who disagree with you for those things.</v>

911
00:41:51.721 --> 00:41:52.554
<v Speaker 2>So you find that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know guys and girls your age are </v>

912
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:57.950
<v Speaker 2>able to have these conversations without</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing each other.</v>

913
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.010
<v Speaker 2>There was a terrible choice of words </v>
<v Speaker 2>without sure,</v>

914
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:04.400
<v Speaker 2>without being at each other's throats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more than adults are right now.</v>

915
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.263
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible because that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a through line with you that you're </v>

916
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 2>friends with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have different opinions.</v>

917
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I think we want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that a lot of people who want to</v>

918
00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:16.430
<v Speaker 2>orange taking the right steps because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying yes we can.</v>

919
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.670
<v Speaker 2>We can come to some common ground if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with me and there's a,</v>

920
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.533
<v Speaker 2>there's a want out there and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something I'm really interested in </v>

921
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:24.523
<v Speaker 2>because I come from a generation that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe puts principles and morals over </v>

922
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:29.083
<v Speaker 2>money and political victories and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that we've actually got a bright </v>

923
00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:35.330
<v Speaker 2>future now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will call me in insane.</v>

924
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Bobby Kennedy more for saying that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a bright future,</v>

925
00:42:37.791 --> 00:42:38.624
<v Speaker 2>but I think we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to de stigmatize the </v>

926
00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:41.324
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of friends who who before </v>

927
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:48.110
<v Speaker 2>seven months ago I would have thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>were racist,</v>

928
00:42:48.111 --> 00:42:48.950
<v Speaker 2>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigoted,</v>

929
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:49.784
<v Speaker 2>homophobes who want the country to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explode and want to destroy everybody </v>

930
00:42:51.921 --> 00:42:52.754
<v Speaker 2>who isn't exactly like them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I learned maybe that's not the </v>

931
00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:55.634
<v Speaker 2>case and I have a lot of friends who </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have thought that I was some </v>

932
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.560
<v Speaker 2>leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beta Kuk shill who who wanted,</v>

933
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.640
<v Speaker 2>who wanted the communists to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's guns and kill them,</v>

934
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.073
<v Speaker 2>and then they learn.</v>

935
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:10.003
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our generation really is moving </v>

936
00:43:13.161 --> 00:43:17.810
<v Speaker 2>in a good direction when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart conversations.</v>

937
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.480
<v Speaker 2>I just think we need a bit of a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>

938
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:23.270
<v Speaker 2>They're not a huge social revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love social revolutions.</v>

939
00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:26.280
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a big revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

940
00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.680
<v Speaker 2>At Beatles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>

941
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:29.260
<v Speaker 2>ms dot level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet we're not.</v>

942
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.510
<v Speaker 2>We're not hearing that people sing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>song and making me men yet,</v>

943
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.260
<v Speaker 2>but we there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need some.</v>

944
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.650
<v Speaker 2>We need a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need a,</v>

945
00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:41.120
<v Speaker 2>a movement towards respecting each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>because look,</v>

946
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:43.130
<v Speaker 2>before all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could have gotten rid of the right,</v>

947
00:43:43.131 --> 00:43:43.964
<v Speaker 2>I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know people who would have gotten </v>

948
00:43:45.441 --> 00:43:47.480
<v Speaker 2>rid of the left if they could have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to happen.</v>

949
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:50.090
<v Speaker 2>The parties might evolve over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

950
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.490
<v Speaker 2>the parties or the parties are flipping </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways.</v>

951
00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:53.693
<v Speaker 2>Think about this.</v>

952
00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:58.370
<v Speaker 2>The party of Lincoln is the only party </v>
<v Speaker 2>that currently we're not the Democrats.</v>

953
00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.720
<v Speaker 2>There are some Democrats who are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

954
00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:00.554
<v Speaker 2>but the majority of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>running as admitted white supremacists </v>

955
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:06.350
<v Speaker 2>are part of the party of Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a Lotta,</v>

956
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.340
<v Speaker 2>a Lotta switches happen there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

957
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:09.643
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got some really awful rhetoric </v>

958
00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:14.240
<v Speaker 2>out there from folks like Candice Owens </v>
<v Speaker 2>who will say,</v>

959
00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 2>we will talk about the left plantation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

960
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I think identity politics are dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but calling saying that the real racists</v>

961
00:44:21.621 --> 00:44:24.890
<v Speaker 2>or the Democrats is a hasty </v>
<v Speaker 2>generalization,</v>

962
00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.113
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's actually some truth to </v>

963
00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:28.394
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between the </v>

964
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:33.240
<v Speaker 2>liberals and the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're speaking my language.</v>

965
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:35.400
<v Speaker 2>The thing is you can't pigeon hole them </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

966
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Aspirational the right word for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

967
00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't pigeonhole them together.</v>

968
00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:39.663
<v Speaker 2>I'm a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that all men and women are </v>

969
00:44:42.761 --> 00:44:44.530
<v Speaker 2>created equal and need to be respected </v>
<v Speaker 2>equally.</v>

970
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Whereas people farther to the left will </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

971
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:49.420
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a white,</v>

972
00:44:49.421 --> 00:44:51.070
<v Speaker 2>cisgender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heterosexual male,</v>

973
00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:52.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the right to say any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

974
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Look you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine,</v>

975
00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Michael Skolnik,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I've worked with before,</v>

976
00:44:57.881 --> 00:44:59.500
<v Speaker 2>said something to me that I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciated,</v>

977
00:44:59.501 --> 00:45:02.320
<v Speaker 2>which was you can't judge somebody by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hand they're dealt.</v>

978
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.110
<v Speaker 2>You judge them by how they elect to play</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hand.</v>

979
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:08.650
<v Speaker 2>People farther to the left will judge me</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the hand I'm dealt.</v>

980
00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:13.200
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a pretty well off family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a pretty easy childhood.</v>

981
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:16.300
<v Speaker 2>I could've walked around my neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 2>without fearing death,</v>

982
00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.150
<v Speaker 2>which is something that some of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends I made in Chicago,</v>

983
00:45:19.151 --> 00:45:19.984
<v Speaker 2>we're not able to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'll say that my opinion is less </v>

984
00:45:23.261 --> 00:45:25.900
<v Speaker 2>valid than anybody's because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with the struggles they do.</v>

985
00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.123
<v Speaker 2>I have an incredible amount of empathy </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people who are not as privileged as </v>

986
00:45:31.031 --> 00:45:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

987
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:35.860
<v Speaker 2>I believe that white privilege exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it's as systematic or,</v>

988
00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:37.550
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

989
00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:39.423
<v Speaker 2>really structural as people say it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the government exists to </v>

990
00:45:42.431 --> 00:45:45.850
<v Speaker 2>oppressed people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but white privilege I believe exists.</v>

991
00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I believe that there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations where I will be,</v>

992
00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.013
<v Speaker 2>where I will be in a better place </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm a white cisgender </v>

993
00:45:53.141 --> 00:45:54.730
<v Speaker 2>heterosexual male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

994
00:45:54.731 --> 00:45:58.060
<v Speaker 2>it's not this large oppressive force </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people treat it like,</v>

995
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:59.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's something we need to address </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.</v>

996
00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.840
<v Speaker 2>That's the real thing I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

997
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.823
<v Speaker 2>which is we can find common ground on </v>
<v Speaker 2>these issues and not try to push each </v>

998
00:46:07.511 --> 00:46:11.350
<v Speaker 2>other away because in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>

999
00:46:11.351 --> 00:46:14.470
<v Speaker 2>white privilege exists and people will </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1000
00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:18.550
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in many situations on the sat,</v>

1001
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:22.240
<v Speaker 2>African American students were given </v>
<v Speaker 2>points and Asian students were,</v>

1002
00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.820
<v Speaker 2>were deducted points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1003
00:46:24.821 --> 00:46:27.430
<v Speaker 2>and that proves that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1004
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:29.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got myself into,</v>

1005
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I don't want.</v>

1006
00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:31.663
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to go too far down down </v>
<v Speaker 2>that road because we could have a whole </v>

1007
00:46:33.681 --> 00:46:35.300
<v Speaker 2>other conversation on that because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1008
00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't agree with you on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1009
00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:39.950
<v Speaker 2>but that's the point of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>

1010
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:42.490
<v Speaker 2>And I'm still learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're still learning it.</v>

1011
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:43.930
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1012
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm 17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can hardly smell.</v>

1013
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:48.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the expert on Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually the point of the new</v>

1014
00:46:48.801 --> 00:46:52.670
<v Speaker 2>podcast I'm putting out pretty soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called Cameron knows nothing.</v>

1015
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you watch game of thrones?</v>

1016
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Grit.</v>

1017
00:46:55.971 --> 00:46:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's true,</v>

1018
00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my own personal views on abortion.</v>

1019
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched a video of yours where you and</v>

1020
00:47:04.251 --> 00:47:06.710
<v Speaker 2>I have this pretty much the same exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>view on the 20 weeks guy.</v>

1021
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also have not taken enough science</v>

1022
00:47:09.621 --> 00:47:10.454
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also do not have not conversed with </v>

1023
00:47:12.081 --> 00:47:16.000
<v Speaker 2>enough women who have had abortions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My opinions mean Jack Shit to have them,</v>

1024
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:17.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1025
00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:18.853
<v Speaker 2>I'm a 17 year old boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's only so much I can truly say </v>

1026
00:47:22.751 --> 00:47:25.540
<v Speaker 2>about pro lifers pro choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm allowed to say it.</v>

1027
00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1028
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 2>in Cameron knows nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm to tell you guys what I think</v>

1029
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:30.873
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't mean it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think that attitude comes </v>

1030
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:34.804
<v Speaker 1>from within you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it seems to me that I think a </v>

1031
00:47:36.761 --> 00:47:37.594
<v Speaker 1>lot of what's happening right now is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see adults that are now afraid to say </v>

1032
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:43.600
<v Speaker 1>what they think and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that the mob is going to come</v>

1033
00:47:43.601 --> 00:47:45.130
<v Speaker 1>after them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is completely legit.</v>

1034
00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:45.964
<v Speaker 1>They think it might hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are job opportunities or things </v>

1035
00:47:48.161 --> 00:47:48.581
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1036
00:47:48.581 --> 00:47:49.241
<v Speaker 1>the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whichever,</v>

1037
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:50.410
<v Speaker 1>whichever way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1038
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:51.244
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what we see boycotts on both </v>

1039
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:55.720
<v Speaker 1>sides and I think a lot of misguided </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger off and uh,</v>

1040
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:58.960
<v Speaker 1>but I think most people need a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit more of what you just did there,</v>

1041
00:47:58.961 --> 00:48:02.050
<v Speaker 1>which is I just am what I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1042
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe convinced me as some other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to learn here.</v>

1043
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hurt anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1045
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.550
<v Speaker 1>I want the government to crack down on </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

1046
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean I want the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>to oppress you.</v>

1047
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:12.773
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that there's a certain amount </v>

1048
00:48:13.631 --> 00:48:14.464
<v Speaker 1>of time somebody should have access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an abortion and I think that abortion </v>

1049
00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:20.200
<v Speaker 1>should be more accessible just for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of time,</v>

1050
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to kill babies and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to oppress women.</v>

1051
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I want the world to be a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want the world to be a better place.</v>

1052
00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about,</v>

1053
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:29.740
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1054
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:31.890
<v Speaker 1>anybody up in the booth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they seem really nice.</v>

1055
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.380
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Todd Macfarlane,</v>

1056
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 1>I hand selected these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1057
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Todd Mcfarlane wants the world to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better place.</v>

1058
00:48:37.871 --> 00:48:39.490
<v Speaker 1>David Hogg wants the world to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better place.</v>

1059
00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson wants the world.</v>

1060
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.600
<v Speaker 1>We all pretty much all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I,</v>

1061
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually glad you mentioned Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson because you know,</v>

1062
00:48:47.111 --> 00:48:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm on tour with him right now.</v>

1063
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.260
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I find is </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

1064
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:51.094
<v Speaker 1>if I meet a ton of people your age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say the bulk of the people that are </v>

1065
00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 1>coming there are young people probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably right around your age,</v>

1066
00:48:57.011 --> 00:48:58.550
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 into,</v>

1067
00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.760
<v Speaker 1>into their probably early thirties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's male,</v>

1068
00:49:00.761 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay,</v>

1069
00:49:01.601 --> 00:49:02.470
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>

1070
00:49:02.471 --> 00:49:03.310
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

1071
00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:04.693
<v Speaker 1>But it's very obvious to me that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>providing some level of guidance that </v>

1072
00:49:08.261 --> 00:49:12.130
<v Speaker 1>somehow it seems that your generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of missed.</v>

1073
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:13.203
<v Speaker 1>Now it sounds like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your folks are pretty great and your </v>

1074
00:49:14.441 --> 00:49:15.274
<v Speaker 1>extended family and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you sense that there is some </v>

1075
00:49:18.401 --> 00:49:22.790
<v Speaker 1>missing piece here that partly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that there's some.</v>

1076
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:23.703
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I discussed this last week with Peter </v>

1077
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:25.833
<v Speaker 1>Teal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was some disconnect between </v>

1078
00:49:26.921 --> 00:49:29.660
<v Speaker 1>the baby boomers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents age and that,</v>

1079
00:49:29.661 --> 00:49:31.390
<v Speaker 1>that my guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gen x people,</v>

1080
00:49:31.391 --> 00:49:32.830
<v Speaker 1>we never had our moment or something.</v>

1081
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:34.900
<v Speaker 1>And then we've sort of handed it off to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

1082
00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:39.100
<v Speaker 1>the millennials and Gen x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gen z actually.</v>

1083
00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did those are?</v>

1084
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Three or four years older than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright man,</v>

1085
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.393
<v Speaker 1>we're all in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to feel bad that we handed </v>

1086
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:48.064
<v Speaker 1>it off to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the generation of people who grew up </v>

1087
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:53.170
<v Speaker 1>with cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate access to knowledge.</v>

1088
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.840
<v Speaker 1>We are the best and worst thing to ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to us.</v>

1089
00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:00.320
<v Speaker 1>If I wanted to get to a hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get to a hospital much easier with</v>

1090
00:50:00.321 --> 00:50:02.200
<v Speaker 1>the cell phone if I want to look up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

1091
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:03.783
<v Speaker 1>forgetting the fact that facts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult right now because it's a fact </v>

1092
00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:08.040
<v Speaker 1>that facts are difficult to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guide is if,</v>

1093
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:10.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1094
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also I,</v>

1095
00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before all of this,</v>

1096
00:50:13.691 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very obsessed with my own image,</v>

1097
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.610
<v Speaker 1>not because I thought I had a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because I wanted it to be good.</v>

1098
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:19.953
<v Speaker 1>I was posting things online because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted people to think I had a cool </v>

1099
00:50:22.601 --> 00:50:23.500
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1100
00:50:23.501 --> 00:50:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great life,</v>

1101
00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:26.890
<v Speaker 1>but I want people to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1102
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it the</v>

1103
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.903
<v Speaker 2>hyperconnectivity of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a term I stole from many Ben </v>

1104
00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Platt interviews where he's talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about his musical.</v>

1105
00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:34.814
<v Speaker 2>Do you Evan Hansen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want him to see this and think </v>

1106
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm stealing the hyperconnectivity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media is,</v>

1107
00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:41.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1108
00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:43.850
<v Speaker 2>is a good and bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the problem here,</v>

1109
00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:45.080
<v Speaker 2>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:46.590
<v Speaker 2>folks like Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of Jordan.</v>

1111
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get a big head of people.</v>

1112
00:50:50.331 --> 00:50:51.164
<v Speaker 2>People like you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that you advocate for </v>

1113
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:55.910
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his conversation and people on the right</v>

1114
00:50:55.911 --> 00:50:57.800
<v Speaker 2>young people on the right that I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm friends with,</v>

1115
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 2>they want to own the lips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all about proving them wrong and</v>

1116
00:51:00.831 --> 00:51:02.510
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facts don't care about your feelings.</v>

1117
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:03.583
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facts by definition don't care about </v>

1118
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:06.524
<v Speaker 2>your feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also logic which is kind of </v>

1119
00:51:08.121 --> 00:51:09.380
<v Speaker 2>the middle between the two really.</v>

1120
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:13.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's the interpretation and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>insight and the fact where we,</v>

1121
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.580
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we only based everything in fact,</v>

1122
00:51:15.581 --> 00:51:17.100
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of young people have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to,</v>

1123
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:19.970
<v Speaker 2>we're just talking about the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't look at the future and you can</v>

1124
00:51:19.971 --> 00:51:20.804
<v Speaker 2>assess facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of a lot of young people on </v>

1125
00:51:23.151 --> 00:51:25.850
<v Speaker 2>the right one to prove people wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of young people on the left,</v>

1126
00:51:25.851 --> 00:51:26.684
<v Speaker 2>I've seen wants to want to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to make people who disagree with </v>

1127
00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:30.884
<v Speaker 2>them look worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about making the other look </v>

1128
00:51:32.211 --> 00:51:33.044
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right ones to show that the left is </v>

1129
00:51:34.371 --> 00:51:37.790
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of copies and left wants to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the rights of bunch of fascists and</v>

1130
00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:39.960
<v Speaker 2>that's a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a.</v>

1131
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:42.050
<v Speaker 2>That is what is harming our country </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1132
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 2>I think Donald Trump's rhetoric is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and harms our country,</v>

1133
00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:46.693
<v Speaker 2>but trump is is the is a symptom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something greater like President Obama </v>

1134
00:51:51.621 --> 00:51:54.740
<v Speaker 2>said when he made his return,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the made all of my liberal friends think</v>

1135
00:51:54.741 --> 00:51:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Jesus came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1136
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>

1137
00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Trump is the result of a country where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who love trump are loving him</v>

1138
00:52:02.451 --> 00:52:03.880
<v Speaker 2>more than ever in the people who hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>

1139
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I hated it more than ever because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>divided.</v>

1140
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:09.200
<v Speaker 2>You know our rhetoric is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is driving,</v>

1141
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.150
<v Speaker 2>is driving everybody in different </v>
<v Speaker 2>directions.</v>

1142
00:52:11.151 --> 00:52:11.984
<v Speaker 2>That's why you see the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic socialism and that's why you </v>

1143
00:52:14.271 --> 00:52:15.104
<v Speaker 2>see the rise of more and more people </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out and saying things that are </v>

1144
00:52:18.081 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 2>stupid because they have the first man </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to do it.</v>

1145
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say something I don't like,</v>

1146
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I will defend it with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will defend with my life.</v>

1147
00:52:25.191 --> 00:52:27.410
<v Speaker 2>You're right to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are mixing,</v>

1148
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:32.440
<v Speaker 2>being not pc and being a jerk and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now we're driving apart.</v>

1149
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:34.910
<v Speaker 2>We need to come together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop attacking each other.</v>

1150
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.863
<v Speaker 2>Both sides are equally as guilty in </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain sides in certain situations are </v>

1151
00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:42.190
<v Speaker 2>obviously guilty gear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

1152
00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1153
00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:44.390
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit.</v>

1154
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.373
<v Speaker 2>So do you sense a little more </v>
<v Speaker 2>flexibility on the ability to talk to </v>

1155
00:52:49.851 --> 00:52:54.350
<v Speaker 2>people on the right than on the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know that that's been a sort</v>

1156
00:52:54.351 --> 00:52:54.780
<v Speaker 2>of</v>

1157
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.613
<v Speaker 1>a big part of what's going on with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I get invited to go to these </v>

1158
00:52:59.070 --> 00:52:59.903
<v Speaker 1>conservative things and turning point </v>
<v Speaker 1>USA and I talk about being gay married </v>

1159
00:53:03.601 --> 00:53:06.720
<v Speaker 1>and I'm pro choice and against the death</v>
<v Speaker 1>penalty and all of these things that are</v>

1160
00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:09.000
<v Speaker 1>thought of as leftists things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they invite me.</v>

1161
00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.013
<v Speaker 1>We have a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take a zillion selfies with the kids </v>

1162
00:53:11.941 --> 00:53:16.320
<v Speaker 1>after and all that stuff where there </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to be that flexibility over</v>

1163
00:53:16.321 --> 00:53:16.880
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I get,</v>

1164
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to harp on this because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get your greater point,</v>

1165
00:53:19.051 --> 00:53:21.420
<v Speaker 1>which is we got to get past this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I am,</v>

1166
00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I do see something on one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially young people that</v>

1167
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.260
<v Speaker 2>has become more corroded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

1168
00:53:28.261 --> 00:53:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1169
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 2>then on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I'll say.</v>

1170
00:53:29.761 --> 00:53:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll say the left cares too much about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the right doesn't care enough.</v>

1171
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.040
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're,</v>

1172
00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.250
<v Speaker 2>they're equally as wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>

1173
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:38.930
<v Speaker 2>The young people on the right will </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack you with facts in,</v>

1174
00:53:38.931 --> 00:53:41.460
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in either positive or negative ways.</v>

1175
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:42.653
<v Speaker 2>And they're open to conversation very </v>
<v Speaker 2>often I believe because they want to </v>

1176
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:47.290
<v Speaker 2>prove you wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've seen from that.</v>

1177
00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:48.990
<v Speaker 2>That's not a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an opinion.</v>

1178
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:50.183
<v Speaker 2>Whereas people on the left wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accommodate for everybody so much that </v>

1179
00:53:53.101 --> 00:53:55.860
<v Speaker 2>if you say anything negative about </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody that they agree with,</v>

1180
00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:00.300
<v Speaker 2>they jumped to their defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll bring up the Israel argument,</v>

1181
00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:02.700
<v Speaker 2>which is an argument that I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough about to form an opinion.</v>

1182
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I truly do not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you are a pro palette,</v>

1183
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.910
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like pretty much everybody.</v>

1184
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.823
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being pro Palestine doesn't mean you </v>

1185
00:54:09.001 --> 00:54:09.834
<v Speaker 2>hate the Jews necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being pro Israel doesn't mean that </v>

1186
00:54:13.111 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 2>you hate everybody who you hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Palestinians,</v>

1187
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.890
<v Speaker 2>but I'll talk to people on the right and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll.</v>

1188
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.620
<v Speaker 2>They'll be happier to talk about it then</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on the left,</v>

1189
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:24.740
<v Speaker 2>but the second I'd say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1190
00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Palestine should have land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>

1191
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:28.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a firm opinion on.</v>

1192
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:30.240
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1193
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:31.620
<v Speaker 2>you're Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could you say that?</v>

1194
00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.293
<v Speaker 2>I'll say because people are people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll talk to people on the left </v>

1195
00:54:34.951 --> 00:54:35.784
<v Speaker 2>about it and I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of concerns of tear and </v>

1196
00:54:39.001 --> 00:54:39.834
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you dare call everybody that </v>

1197
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.330
<v Speaker 2>everybody who's Palestinian terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 2>and on both sides.</v>

1198
00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:46.830
<v Speaker 2>You're so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yes.</v>

1199
00:54:46.831 --> 00:54:48.930
<v Speaker 2>I think the right is more open to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

1200
00:54:48.931 --> 00:54:51.810
<v Speaker 2>but I think that more people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right are trying to lure you into a cave</v>

1201
00:54:51.811 --> 00:54:52.644
<v Speaker 2>where they can prove you wrong.</v>

1202
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be proven right or wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1203
00:54:55.951 --> 00:54:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I want to discuss because my opinions on</v>
<v Speaker 2>things have changed.</v>

1204
00:54:58.531 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 2>My opinions really are not taking a one </v>
<v Speaker 2>80.</v>

1205
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I have all my opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my opinion on opinions is changing.</v>

1206
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:07.973
<v Speaker 2>That's that's the most important thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to highlight here if I'm </v>

1207
00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:12.630
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think that,</v>

1208
00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:15.270
<v Speaker 2>and we've talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think that if you didn't agree</v>

1209
00:55:15.271 --> 00:55:16.104
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hate me.</v>

1210
00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Now I've learned a different thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1211
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.133
<v Speaker 2>and what I'm advocating for now is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not asking people to change their </v>

1212
00:55:22.501 --> 00:55:23.334
<v Speaker 2>perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking people to stop having your </v>

1213
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:30.020
<v Speaker 2>feet so firmly on the ground when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>a child,</v>

1214
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:33.060
<v Speaker 2>because I'm a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know I can't rent a car.</v>

1215
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't smoke a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor do I intend to,</v>

1216
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:40.360
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you about.</v>

1217
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.900
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you with authority about </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics.</v>

1218
00:55:42.901 --> 00:55:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't taken an econ class or finance</v>

1219
00:55:45.661 --> 00:55:50.550
<v Speaker 2>class and we need young already doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than most experts on CNN.</v>

1220
00:55:50.551 --> 00:55:51.384
<v Speaker 2>I think people on the left and the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to need to realize that facts are </v>

1221
00:55:58.081 --> 00:55:59.790
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feelings are feelings,</v>

1222
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:00.810
<v Speaker 2>logic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his logic,</v>

1223
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.290
<v Speaker 2>but the more and more we try to prove </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other wrong,</v>

1224
00:56:04.291 --> 00:56:08.610
<v Speaker 2>the less progress we're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have had the mindset.</v>

1225
00:56:08.611 --> 00:56:10.650
<v Speaker 2>That's why I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had the mindset,</v>

1226
00:56:10.651 --> 00:56:14.190
<v Speaker 2>we're all I wanted to do is just own the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and I know people have had</v>

1227
00:56:14.191 --> 00:56:17.950
<v Speaker 2>the mindset where all they want to do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>own the lips by.</v>

1228
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:18.960
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're not.</v>

1229
00:56:18.961 --> 00:56:20.850
<v Speaker 2>You're saying this because Kyle </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Hsu,</v>

1230
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.713
<v Speaker 2>who I've gotten to know well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who falls off and on the other side of </v>

1231
00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

1232
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:24.963
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's now working with turning point and </v>

1233
00:56:26.381 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to strengthen the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment and all sorts of other things.</v>

1234
00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.153
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are friends and you guys are </v>

1235
00:56:33.101 --> 00:56:33.934
<v Speaker 1>still able to talk about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had originally said maybe we </v>

1236
00:56:36.461 --> 00:56:37.294
<v Speaker 1>could get both you guys in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we thought this would be a good </v>

1237
00:56:38.921 --> 00:56:42.070
<v Speaker 1>opportunity just to let you do your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and I'll have kyle on separately.</v>

1238
00:56:42.071 --> 00:56:44.440
<v Speaker 1>But you guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite your differences,</v>

1239
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.660
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're able to talk</v>

1240
00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:47.780
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kyle does.</v>

1241
00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost everything he says,</v>

1242
00:56:50.101 --> 00:56:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with some things he says that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think are inappropriate.</v>

1243
00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I've said some inappropriate stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1244
00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I understand if you don't agree with me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you want to come out and speak,</v>

1245
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud that I was able to speak after</v>

1246
00:57:06.001 --> 00:57:08.370
<v Speaker 2>the shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Kyle did too.</v>

1247
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:09.353
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a deep understanding of his </v>

1248
00:57:10.981 --> 00:57:13.710
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So beyond the podcast,</v>

1249
00:57:13.711 --> 00:57:15.900
<v Speaker 2>and I will give you my word that I will </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the podcast.</v>

1250
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1251
00:57:16.561 --> 00:57:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Well you asked me to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The email was.</v>

1253
00:57:18.991 --> 00:57:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Can you do my phone that I'm lucky </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to be here?</v>

1254
00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more than happy to do it.</v>

1255
00:57:22.351 --> 00:57:23.460
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll make that happen.</v>

1256
00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1257
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:26.230
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do?</v>

1258
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you really been able to think about</v>

1259
00:57:28.751 --> 00:57:29.584
<v Speaker 1>it at this point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's sort of an annoying </v>

1260
00:57:31.211 --> 00:57:32.590
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask a young person?</v>

1261
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:33.500
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1262
00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you what college I want to </v>

1263
00:57:35.781 --> 00:57:36.614
<v Speaker 2>go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you where I want to be in </v>

1264
00:57:37.401 --> 00:57:39.800
<v Speaker 2>50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell you that right now.</v>

1265
00:57:39.801 --> 00:57:40.634
<v Speaker 2>I want to dedicate my time to do them </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think is the best thing I could </v>

1266
00:57:42.681 --> 00:57:43.514
<v Speaker 2>do with my platform because I have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>large platform for all the worst </v>

1267
00:57:46.191 --> 00:57:47.024
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with great platform comes great </v>

1268
00:57:48.651 --> 00:57:50.780
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spiderman.</v>

1269
00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uncle Ben said that,</v>

1270
00:57:52.401 --> 00:57:55.760
<v Speaker 2>I believe it wasn't a gold band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you say uncle Ben on this show,</v>

1271
00:57:55.761 --> 00:57:58.090
<v Speaker 2>people might be like kindly talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about entropy.</v>

1272
00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:00.103
<v Speaker 2>Ben Parker and I have responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do what I think is right and what I </v>

1273
00:58:04.401 --> 00:58:06.320
<v Speaker 2>think is right is advocating for what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in,</v>

1274
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:07.363
<v Speaker 2>but also making sure that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation is mended and healed </v>

1275
00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:12.163
<v Speaker 2>because who better than the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are about to become adults to try and </v>

1276
00:58:16.101 --> 00:58:18.650
<v Speaker 2>make sure that our next generation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>adults knows how to work together.</v>

1277
00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got Nelson and Rubio in Florida.</v>

1278
00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nelson Rubio had passed some great bills</v>

1279
00:58:24.291 --> 00:58:27.680
<v Speaker 2>together because Nelson Rubio don't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>eye to eye,</v>

1280
00:58:27.681 --> 00:58:30.500
<v Speaker 2>but they are able to put their </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences aside.</v>

1281
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.440
<v Speaker 2>They get along and I want more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Well man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1283
00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people were worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the future,</v>

1284
00:58:36.451 --> 00:58:37.284
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's clear to me that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>future is bright and if we can hand it </v>

1285
00:58:39.991 --> 00:58:42.030
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to hand it over to to,</v>

1286
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.460
<v Speaker 1>to people like you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll be all right because this is.</v>

1287
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.470
<v Speaker 1>This is everything that I've been trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do here.</v>

1288
00:58:46.471 --> 00:58:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it's summed up in the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to go forward with life.</v>

1289
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:51.840
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1290
00:58:51.841 --> 00:58:52.400
<v Speaker 1>It's inspiring.</v>

1291
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you something,</v>

1292
00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:55.870
<v Speaker 2>your show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to.</v>

1293
00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.670
<v Speaker 2>We're going to swap your flip it and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in theater.</v>

1294
00:58:58.690 --> 00:58:59.121
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1295
00:58:59.121 --> 00:59:00.410
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1296
00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:04.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what,</v>

1297
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:05.323
<v Speaker 2>what are the qualities you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>for in a candidate if you are going to </v>

1298
00:59:07.731 --> 00:59:09.440
<v Speaker 2>vote for them over president trump in </v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

1299
00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:10.283
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>

1300
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.193
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really putting me on the spot </v>

1301
00:59:11.861 --> 00:59:12.940
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my show.</v>

1302
00:59:12.941 --> 00:59:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said this before,</v>

1303
00:59:14.171 --> 00:59:15.004
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately the democratic socialist </v>

1304
00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:21.890
<v Speaker 1>wing of the Democrats has gone really </v>
<v Speaker 1>far left.</v>

1305
00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:22.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1306
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:25.550
<v Speaker 1>the word socialist is in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in the title now,</v>

1307
00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:28.160
<v Speaker 1>and purge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1308
00:59:28.161 --> 00:59:28.994
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're being honest for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are and they're fighting for what </v>

1309
00:59:30.291 --> 00:59:31.124
<v Speaker 1>they believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I happen to disagree with virtually all </v>

1310
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:34.340
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that they're doing that.</v>

1311
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:38.270
<v Speaker 1>They've basically purged what I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the remaining liberals,</v>

1312
00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:40.160
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical liberals before.</v>

1313
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:43.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think unfortunately that leaves a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of us.</v>

1314
00:59:43.581 --> 00:59:44.414
<v Speaker 1>It's why people watch my show because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just been honest about what I see </v>

1315
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:47.834
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That leaves a lot of us suddenly with </v>

1316
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:53.450
<v Speaker 1>allies in places that we didn't think we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to have allies.</v>

1317
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:54.283
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of unfortunate in one way </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want to always think that </v>

1318
00:59:56.481 --> 00:59:59.510
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of stay home and fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1319
00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.373
<v Speaker 1>I got to pop the bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the moment I find my allies who </v>

1320
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:06.260
<v Speaker 1>certainly are libertarians on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can,</v>

1321
01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be allies and a lot of ways with Ben </v>

1322
01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.493
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we have differences on the </v>

1323
01:00:10.161 --> 01:00:12.440
<v Speaker 1>margins with abortion and some of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other stuff.</v>

1324
01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see at the moment from when </v>

1325
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:18.283
<v Speaker 1>we're taping this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see any hope in the short </v>

1326
01:00:21.231 --> 01:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>term for the Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My hope is that this thing implodes that</v>

1327
01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:27.970
<v Speaker 1>they get probably half to get crushed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the midterms,</v>

1328
01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.813
<v Speaker 1>which is not looking likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that they get crushed in the </v>

1329
01:00:30.951 --> 01:00:31.784
<v Speaker 1>midterms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they have a major course </v>

1330
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>adjustment where they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to return to liberalism.</v>

1331
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is the answer because I believe</v>

1332
01:00:40.491 --> 01:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>liberalism is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the only answer.</v>

1333
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.490
<v Speaker 1>But if you know somebody that I should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be paying attention to,</v>

1334
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:48.500
<v Speaker 1>let me know because I don't see much.</v>

1335
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:51.680
<v Speaker 2>We'll keep in touch and I know we've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>a list.</v>

1336
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.863
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you some liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one more thing I know we're about </v>

1337
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:57.043
<v Speaker 2>onto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1338
01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:58.853
<v Speaker 2>What is your favorite musical and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>which musical character do you identify </v>

1339
01:01:01.201 --> 01:01:02.070
<v Speaker 2>the most?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

1340
01:01:02.071 --> 01:01:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really going for it.</v>

1341
01:01:03.091 --> 01:01:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather do favorite superhero movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something,</v>

1342
01:01:05.251 --> 01:01:06.870
<v Speaker 2>but a superior moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to that.</v>

1343
01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.153
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling you during the break that </v>

1344
01:01:08.701 --> 01:01:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1345
01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:12.480
<v Speaker 2>I really felt infinity war was </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular.</v>

1346
01:01:12.481 --> 01:01:15.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just done right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loki has to be dead though.</v>

1347
01:01:15.511 --> 01:01:17.310
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the key thing I want.</v>

1348
01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:20.250
<v Speaker 2>But I think I love Gomorrah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's amazing.</v>

1349
01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:23.130
<v Speaker 2>She's a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they bring her back,</v>

1350
01:01:23.131 --> 01:01:26.160
<v Speaker 2>which they will bring her back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was killed in the process of getting</v>

1351
01:01:26.161 --> 01:01:28.530
<v Speaker 2>the soul stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they can say that once they destroyed</v>

1352
01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:30.180
<v Speaker 2>the stones or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however it may be,</v>

1353
01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:31.323
<v Speaker 2>they could bring her back and it'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice to see her back because I love her </v>

1354
01:01:33.871 --> 01:01:35.550
<v Speaker 2>as an actress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love her chemistry with everyone.</v>

1355
01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.613
<v Speaker 2>But that was a powerful me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't keep killing people and </v>

1356
01:01:39.991 --> 01:01:40.824
<v Speaker 2>bringing them back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why Loki has to be dead this </v>

1357
01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:43.980
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which they basically made it sound like.</v>

1358
01:01:43.981 --> 01:01:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What infinity ward did a good job with.</v>

1359
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.370
<v Speaker 2>You know Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony has been in Mcu for what?</v>

1360
01:01:50.371 --> 01:01:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Like 20 movies and he didn't die </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gomorrah.</v>

1361
01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:57.150
<v Speaker 2>This is her third film and I felt that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt that debt right here.</v>

1362
01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I hate to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's,</v>

1363
01:01:58.410 --> 01:01:59.730
<v Speaker 2>well hate to tell you or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's good.</v>

1364
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.420
<v Speaker 2>She's going to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But putting that aside,</v>

1365
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:02.640
<v Speaker 2>musical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1366
01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a huge musical guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1367
01:02:05.011 --> 01:02:07.250
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't want to hear that as </v>
