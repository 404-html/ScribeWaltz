00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 1>In case you've been hiding under a rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you just don't have twitter,</v>

2
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:08.514
<v Speaker 1>bless your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye West made his return to the </v>

3
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>platform and proceeded to crack the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet with seven dirty words,</v>

4
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>which would've put even George Carlin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame.</v>

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Last Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye tweeted,</v>

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I love the way candace owens thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know candice.</v>

7
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's a black conservative woman who</v>

8
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>originally went under the Youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moniker,</v>

9
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:26.724
<v Speaker 1>red pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black candace caught fire online around </v>

10
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.754
<v Speaker 1>the summer of 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my interview with her in which we </v>

11
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>discussed her evolution from a lefty to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a conservative,</v>

12
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>is one of the moments that really put </v>
<v Speaker 1>her on the map.</v>

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time that she had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to explain herself in her own words</v>

14
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:42.024
<v Speaker 1>in a long form conversational setting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to rehash the whole thing </v>

15
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:45.924
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but candace is no stranger to </v>

16
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:47.994
<v Speaker 1>controversy and you may remember that </v>
<v Speaker 1>infamous debate that I had with candice </v>

17
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>and Blair white late last year.</v>

18
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was a debacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make no bones about it,</v>

19
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.394
<v Speaker 1>but hashtag save.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave trended on twitter to who might've </v>

20
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.453
<v Speaker 1>complained 2018 has already been a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>year for candice as she was hired as </v>

21
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>communications director for turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>point USA,</v>

22
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>the largest conservative college group </v>
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>

23
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.653
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's been touring the country with </v>

24
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Kirk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to young people,</v>

25
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>particularly young black people as why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should embrace the victim mentality</v>

26
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.744
<v Speaker 1>rather than the victim mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is included directly attacking the </v>

27
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter movement as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic policies,</v>

28
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>which candice argues has decimated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>black family and the black community.</v>

29
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Just last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candice,</v>

30
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Charlie and I spoke at Berkeley to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild crowd.</v>

31
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud to say that we had agreements </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had disagreements and even though</v>

32
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>our styles are different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt,</v>

33
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>candice certainly goes for the juggler </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than I do.</v>

34
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I always enjoyed doing events with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>and seeing her evolve politically.</v>

35
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.593
<v Speaker 1>Something I know a bit about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's learning as she goes and as she </v>

36
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>said to me in our interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had swallowed the red pill,</v>

37
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>then she had snorted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond any of the politics though,</v>

38
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>candice is a friend and our differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't define us.</v>

39
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>They actually bring us together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

40
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Back to Connie for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond the headlines,</v>

41
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:08.274
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a ton about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm obviously aware enough to </v>

42
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>recognize what a transcending cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure he is.</v>

43
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Not only is he hugely successful in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>music world,</v>

44
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:17.994
<v Speaker 1>he has a hugely successful fashion line </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's married to Kim Kardashians who </v>

45
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:22.014
<v Speaker 1>has her own empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not like the guy for whatever </v>

46
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but make no mistake.</v>

47
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:27.024
<v Speaker 1>He is an absolute mogul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may not like or even respect the </v>

48
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>influence that celebrities have over </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture these days,</v>

49
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:38.481
<v Speaker 1>but Kanye is truly someone who can move </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's minds with what he raps or with</v>

50
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>what he tweets.</v>

51
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what happened with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven words.</v>

52
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Immediately after Connie's tweet in </v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive candice,</v>

53
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the Internet went ablaze twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>

54
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Lead story was about Kanye support for </v>
<v Speaker 1>far right.</v>

55
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Candice Owens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Candice was called Anti Gay and racist.</v>

56
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:56.934
<v Speaker 1>Something I'm still confused about as </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's had dinner here with me and my </v>

57
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>husband at our home where her antiganey </v>
<v Speaker 1>has never seemed to leak out as racist.</v>

58
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like a white lefty </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling a black person who doesn't think</v>

59
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:09.214
<v Speaker 1>as they demand that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the black person is the actual </v>

60
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>racist against their own race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irony is truly dead.</v>

61
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On Monday this week,</v>

62
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Kanye refused to back down despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>hysterics from the media.</v>

63
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>He tweeted out a bunch of videos by </v>
<v Speaker 1>another form of Rubin report.</v>

64
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Guess bestselling author and Dober </v>
<v Speaker 1>creators,</v>

65
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Scott Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In essence,</v>

66
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>these videos were Scott talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a free thinker Kanye is.</v>

67
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:29.944
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

68
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.843
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the usual suspects like buzzfeed media </v>

69
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>at the daily beast and others were </v>
<v Speaker 1>labeling Scott Adams as far right.</v>

70
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.593
<v Speaker 1>We've seen the script a million times </v>
<v Speaker 1>before with anyone who dare challenge </v>

71
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:43.950
<v Speaker 1>leftist Orthodoxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be it candice Scott Column,</v>

72
00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Moriarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson,</v>

73
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.443
<v Speaker 1>or even little old me when mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>media has moved so far left that this </v>

74
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:50.914
<v Speaker 1>wide collection of people are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>smeared with the same charges of far </v>

75
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.844
<v Speaker 1>right racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that the overton window hasn't </v>

76
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>just shifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's shattered.</v>

77
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>The authors of these pieces aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists,</v>

78
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>they're activists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or as candace says,</v>

79
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>they are a journalist there hitman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To recap,</v>

80
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.813
<v Speaker 1>we have a new player in Kansas who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fearlessly saying how she believes that </v>

81
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.834
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats have used the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>community for decades and that the </v>

82
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>victimhood mentality of the left is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>root of this problem.</v>

83
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.753
<v Speaker 1>This by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is similar to what plenty of other </v>

84
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 1>conservatives have been saying for </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

85
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:25.294
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this includes even black conservatives </v>

86
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>like my former guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry elder and Thomas Soul.</v>

87
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.143
<v Speaker 1>The voices of black conservatives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>others espousing similar ideas has been </v>

88
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>largely ignored by the mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

89
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 1>and that is exactly why everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out about his tweets.</v>

90
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.963
<v Speaker 1>He just gave oxygen to a set of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Democrats and the mainstream </v>

91
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:47.614
<v Speaker 1>media don't want you to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since they've controlled the </v>

92
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:51.154
<v Speaker 1>narrative for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've relied on the usual smears of </v>

93
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobia,</v>

94
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:55.894
<v Speaker 1>and bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of strengthening their own </v>

95
00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:58.594
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your ideas get fat and lazy when you </v>

96
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 1>don't have to work them out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've owned the narrative for so long.</v>

97
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>This is where the modern left finds </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself right now.</v>

98
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 1>If Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his views are far right,</v>

99
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>then that means that about 40 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

100
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>if not more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>falls into that category.</v>

101
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>I do want to address a different lurking</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger here.</v>

102
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:19.414
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know candace and I believe her to be </v>

103
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>forthright and passionate as she figures</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all out.</v>

104
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I obviously don't know Kanye nor any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his political beliefs,</v>

105
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.203
<v Speaker 1>so we have an interesting match here </v>
<v Speaker 1>where candice is now the rocket and </v>

106
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.013
<v Speaker 1>Kanye is the jet fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If candice doesn't do the intellectual </v>

107
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 1>work to really figure out what she </v>
<v Speaker 1>believes and why she believes it all the</v>

108
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:40.204
<v Speaker 1>while being under the insane microscope </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the media that's going to be praying </v>

109
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:43.954
<v Speaker 1>for her to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then the rocket will be faulty and </v>

110
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:47.224
<v Speaker 1>this experiment will blow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if Kanye says something absolutely </v>

111
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>crazy tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not only possible,</v>

112
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:56.270
<v Speaker 1>it's probable or something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter to everything else that can just</v>

113
00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>believes he's been known to stir the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot,</v>

114
00:05:58.581 --> 00:05:59.414
<v Speaker 1>and I can only assume that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that will happen either </v>

115
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:02.414
<v Speaker 1>intentionally or by mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does her rocket ship run out of fuel in </v>

116
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.533
<v Speaker 1>midflight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that leave this incredible </v>

117
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:09.314
<v Speaker 1>momentum over the past year when I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to people like Eric and Bret </v>

118
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.101
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson,</v>

119
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Elder,</v>

120
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many others.</v>

121
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.843
<v Speaker 1>What I'm most impressed by is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete their outlook on politics and </v>

122
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>more broadly on life is they don't jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>from conclusion to conclusion.</v>

123
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:24.884
<v Speaker 1>Depending on the political climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try to really understand what they </v>

124
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as new issues arise,</v>

125
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>they're responses are complete rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than conflicted.</v>

126
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.083
<v Speaker 1>This is something I've really tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate into my thinking and </v>

127
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>something that I know many of you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do as well.</v>

128
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.783
<v Speaker 1>This will also be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Candice is challenged now and I think </v>

129
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:43.874
<v Speaker 1>she's up to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only she could decide that for </v>

130
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It blows my mind that every conversation</v>

131
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>we have in this room seems to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more relevant as time goes by.</v>

132
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 1>For All I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have Kanye in that guest seat soon</v>

133
00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:57.824
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he is just rocket fuel to boost </v>

134
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:00.914
<v Speaker 1>ideas or is he the rocket ship that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>get us to the solutions remains to be </v>

135
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>seen but make no mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issues around free speech,</v>

136
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:09.734
<v Speaker 1>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the uncomfortable truths that might </v>

137
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 1>be the answers to those questions have </v>
<v Speaker 1>just been leveled up.</v>

138
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Are the players ready for the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>level?</v>

139
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 1>We'll soon find out</v>

140
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.210
<v Speaker 2>joining me today as a national security </v>

<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having me,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to have you here.</v>

146
00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Sara.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First off that voice,</v>

147
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.673
<v Speaker 2>you have a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done any voice over work </v>

148
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.250
<v Speaker 2>at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

149
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.650
<v Speaker 2>it's don't tell anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's my dream.</v>

150
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.050
<v Speaker 2>What I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating Jihad.</v>

151
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I asked about the audio book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

152
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get to do the audio book </v>
<v Speaker 2>right by publishers.</v>

153
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.000
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't do the prologue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we'll get a pro.</v>

154
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.150
<v Speaker 2>I was crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the next book coming out in June.</v>

155
00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Why we fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if you're listening to margie.</v>

156
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really can't believe that.</v>

157
00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:07.854
<v Speaker 2>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have already spent a good amount of </v>

158
00:08:09.931 --> 00:08:13.530
<v Speaker 2>time talking about star wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so very impressed.</v>

159
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Your Green Room and that post.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen that in the quarry posted</v>

160
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.800
<v Speaker 2>before on the LP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm impressed.</v>

161
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.830
<v Speaker 2>That is the original 1977 poster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>

162
00:08:22.831 --> 00:08:23.664
<v Speaker 2>do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're obviously going to talk a </v>

163
00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:27.480
<v Speaker 2>lot about national security and foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy and all that,</v>

164
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.523
<v Speaker 2>do you think any of your thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 2>related to foreign policy had anything </v>

165
00:08:31.771 --> 00:08:35.130
<v Speaker 2>to do with Star Wars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I do think at some level some of</v>

166
00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:38.970
<v Speaker 2>the way I view the world has been shaped</v>
<v Speaker 2>by some of the Lore and all the.</v>

167
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.823
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it's causing effect but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But absolutely in terms of good and </v>

168
00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:45.660
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean totally.</v>

169
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.553
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first three movies are about good </v>

170
00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:52.650
<v Speaker 2>versus evil before they become this </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice warrior absurdity.</v>

171
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.820
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

172
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as much being the son</v>

173
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 3>of people who lived on the Nazi and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>communist dictatorship that these things</v>

174
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:02.240
<v Speaker 3>kind of flow together so</v>

175
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.453
<v Speaker 4>or is and growing up under the child </v>
<v Speaker 4>with people who escaped from </v>

176
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.321
<v Speaker 4>dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

177
00:09:08.321 --> 00:09:09.071
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

178
00:09:09.071 --> 00:09:09.904
<v Speaker 4>so you are in California because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were talking to a couple conservative </v>

179
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.133
<v Speaker 4>groups here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't believe that conservative </v>

180
00:09:17.141 --> 00:09:17.974
<v Speaker 4>groups could exist in California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mentioned to you before we just </v>

181
00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:20.944
<v Speaker 4>had governor John Casick on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was talking with Arnold </v>

182
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.900
<v Speaker 4>Schwartzenegger at some conservative </v>
<v Speaker 4>groups here in California.</v>

183
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:26.973
<v Speaker 4>So are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like something is happening in </v>

184
00:09:29.411 --> 00:09:30.190
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>

185
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.023
<v Speaker 3>I don't live here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I come in and out to do these </v>

186
00:09:33.221 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

187
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.090
<v Speaker 3>something's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So something clearly is happening.</v>

188
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the energy I felt,</v>

189
00:09:39.791 --> 00:09:40.231
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

190
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:41.064
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the events here is like the energy I </v>

191
00:09:43.961 --> 00:09:46.300
<v Speaker 3>feel at events in Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

192
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.130
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or elsewhere,</v>

193
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.370
<v Speaker 3>like Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a commonality.</v>

194
00:09:51.371 --> 00:09:55.180
<v Speaker 3>Whoever you speak to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they keep mentioning the same things.</v>

195
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.930
<v Speaker 3>They talk about the gas tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they talk about sanctuary cities,</v>

196
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.450
<v Speaker 3>they talk about the burden on </v>
<v Speaker 3>businesses.</v>

197
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.403
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get these things repeated </v>

198
00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:04.084
<v Speaker 3>enough times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize something is happening in </v>

199
00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:08.830
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows where it'll go,</v>

200
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.770
<v Speaker 3>but this isn't the state I used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

201
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.610
<v Speaker 3>the People's republic just last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure.</v>

202
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.943
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do you think this could be something </v>

203
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 4>that could happen as soon as our next,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our gubernatorial election that's coming</v>

204
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:22.734
<v Speaker 4>up now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or do you think this is sort of </v>

205
00:10:23.671 --> 00:10:25.530
<v Speaker 4>longterm?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe presidential election,</v>

206
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 4>20 slash 20 or</v>

207
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.563
<v Speaker 3>all I'll say is the following with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>election of Donald J dot trump to </v>

208
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:31.554
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The political rule book has been </v>

209
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:36.900
<v Speaker 3>shredded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>burnt,</v>

210
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Speaker 3>buried under a Donald Trump jumped up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and down on it.</v>

211
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.540
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

212
00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:46.541
<v Speaker 3>so any past expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any trendlines are irrelevant.</v>

213
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean I traveled with the president to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We flew on Air Force One to Youngstown,</v>

214
00:10:51.121 --> 00:10:55.890
<v Speaker 3>Ohio back in June.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Steel Valley,</v>

215
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:56.843
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the heart of a blue collar </v>

216
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manual laborers.</v>

217
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:02.421
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

218
00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 3>we arrived at the stadium and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president was in the back.</v>

219
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:11.601
<v Speaker 3>I was doing selfies with the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crowd selfie.</v>

220
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:12.774
<v Speaker 3>I've seen many crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it cost me that they want to </v>

221
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:15.961
<v Speaker 3>sell for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

222
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:16.794
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

223
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got to engage with these people and</v>

224
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.760
<v Speaker 3>I realized that in this stage you move </v>
<v Speaker 3>on at 20,</v>

225
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.010
<v Speaker 3>25,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

226
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was either a former registered</v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrat,</v>

227
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 3>their parents or grandparents were all </v>
<v Speaker 3>democrats.</v>

228
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 3>And then what happens when the president</v>
<v Speaker 3>or when the first lady Melania comes out</v>

229
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 3>of the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it erupts.</v>

230
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 3>The building erupts with chance with USA</v>
<v Speaker 3>drain the swamp.</v>

231
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.430
<v Speaker 3>And this is Democrat territory now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that can happen in young stoner,</v>

232
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.810
<v Speaker 3>youngstown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ohio,</v>

233
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 3>who knows what can happen in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

234
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.583
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I want to talk a little bit about </v>

235
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 4>your history and your parents and </v>
<v Speaker 4>growing up that I just mentioned,</v>

236
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:53.883
<v Speaker 4>but as long as we're on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the first part of the trump portion </v>

237
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:57.220
<v Speaker 4>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just keep doing that.</v>

238
00:11:57.221 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 4>I heard you at the turning point usa a </v>
<v Speaker 4>event in December.</v>

239
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Give a speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I really thought was wonderful and</v>

240
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:08.131
<v Speaker 4>you described trump as the icebreaker </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what I've been saying around here is</v>

241
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.290
<v Speaker 4>that I view him as the bull in the China</v>
<v Speaker 4>shop.</v>

242
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 4>We wanted a panther to knock over a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

243
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:14.614
<v Speaker 4>but we got the bowl and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really the same analogy that we're </v>

244
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:18.350
<v Speaker 4>using there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

245
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.100
<v Speaker 4>so can you just further on that one?</v>

246
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.380
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

247
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.153
<v Speaker 3>the United States was covered for at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least 30 years in this massive </v>

248
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:26.544
<v Speaker 3>permafrost layer of ice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is political correctness and it </v>

249
00:12:29.371 --> 00:12:32.670
<v Speaker 3>had frozen over the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>education,</v>

250
00:12:32.671 --> 00:12:33.570
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>

251
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.573
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the extent that by the Obama </v>

252
00:12:35.431 --> 00:12:36.264
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal government was telling you who </v>

253
00:12:37.741 --> 00:12:40.110
<v Speaker 3>could use which bathrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just insanity.</v>

254
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then along comes a guy who,</v>

255
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 3>the first day I met him in summer of </v>
<v Speaker 3>June 15 in his office in trump tower,</v>

256
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.353
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I knew about this man is</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the Kryptonite of political </v>

257
00:12:51.781 --> 00:12:52.351
<v Speaker 3>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

258
00:12:52.351 --> 00:12:53.670
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't care less about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

259
00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:55.830
<v Speaker 3>the New York Times or CNN says about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>given issue.</v>

260
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.490
<v Speaker 3>So along comes this man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>layer of ice frozen over the country,</v>

261
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Fam slams into it like an ice breaker </v>
<v Speaker 3>and smashes through the ice.</v>

262
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.890
<v Speaker 3>So he breaks a pathway for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the nation to,</v>

263
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:09.620
<v Speaker 3>to open up that silane.</v>

264
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:10.663
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my argument to conservative </v>

265
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:14.970
<v Speaker 3>audiences is that this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is monumental.</v>

266
00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:17.640
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't going to be the path that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could never have one.</v>

267
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.160
<v Speaker 3>It had to be the bull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had to be the icebreaker.</v>

268
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.650
<v Speaker 3>But if you know your physics of </v>
<v Speaker 3>icebreaking,</v>

269
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.410
<v Speaker 3>you can send that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

270
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.800
<v Speaker 3>thousands of tons worth of shipping </v>
<v Speaker 3>there with its tungsten hall rides up on</v>

271
00:13:28.801 --> 00:13:29.634
<v Speaker 3>the ice slices through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't have the flotilla </v>

272
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.933
<v Speaker 3>behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that comes up and keeps that passageway </v>

273
00:13:35.551 --> 00:13:37.330
<v Speaker 3>open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what actually happens in real life?</v>

274
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.250
<v Speaker 3>You suddenly one ship in breaks apart </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost instantaneously.</v>

275
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.263
<v Speaker 3>The ice comes around the bow and read </v>
<v Speaker 3>knits itself right around the ship and </v>

276
00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:46.044
<v Speaker 3>reseals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the moment in the </v>

277
00:13:47.311 --> 00:13:48.144
<v Speaker 3>conservative movement where we have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get serious about what does it mean to </v>

278
00:13:51.271 --> 00:13:54.570
<v Speaker 3>be a conservative in the 21st century?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the role of government?</v>

279
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:56.330
<v Speaker 3>How does national security look?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

280
00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.960
<v Speaker 3>so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

281
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.853
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump is the catalyst now we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do the heavy lifting of ideology and </v>

282
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:04.080
<v Speaker 3>politics and policy.</v>

283
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he will years from now when</v>

284
00:14:06.691 --> 00:14:09.330
<v Speaker 4>we look back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be anything other than the catalysts?</v>

285
00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:10.164
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you consider his ideas compared </v>

286
00:14:12.721 --> 00:14:13.554
<v Speaker 4>to traditionally conservative ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>because just in the last couple months </v>

287
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.450
<v Speaker 4>after signing the Omni bus thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

288
00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:19.284
<v Speaker 4>right now when we're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're taping this a few days before </v>

289
00:14:20.701 --> 00:14:22.950
<v Speaker 4>we're going to air it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a big mess in Syria.</v>

290
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:25.170
<v Speaker 4>We're not sure if there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>more intervention or not.</v>

291
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.213
<v Speaker 4>He seems to be doing some things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are probably a little more big </v>

292
00:14:28.981 --> 00:14:29.814
<v Speaker 4>government than perhaps you want or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or certainly then his base seems to </v>

293
00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:33.654
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So where do you think he fits actually </v>

294
00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 4>between catalyst and the enabler and the</v>

295
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 3>flotilla?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first things first.</v>

296
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 3>I hate labels personally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

297
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:42.470
<v Speaker 3>I think labels is lazy thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

298
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.473
<v Speaker 3>and in the case of Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that irrelevant and they have no </v>

299
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:47.790
<v Speaker 3>application,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

300
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>credit.</v>

301
00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monica Crowley,</v>

302
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 3>my friend with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weekend after</v>

303
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:57.220
<v Speaker 2>the election was David Horowitz is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it a restoration weekend in Florida,</v>

304
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.280
<v Speaker 2>which was either going to be awake or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the party that was,</v>

305
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.620
<v Speaker 2>and Monica gave a great speech in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

306
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:04.454
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody misunderstands who this man </v>

307
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:07.094
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was never an ideological candidate </v>

308
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 2>because you simply cannot put him in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>box because of what he does,</v>

309
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 2>whether it's his attitude to gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage,</v>

310
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:16.580
<v Speaker 2>whether it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just is what it is.</v>

311
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Just a sort of mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was never an ideological candidate.</v>

312
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 2>He was an attitudinal candidate and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>nailed it.</v>

313
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Now what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the last 40 years.</v>

314
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 2>This guy is 71 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to change.</v>

315
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.433
<v Speaker 2>He is who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What has he done for the last 40 years </v>

316
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:35.450
<v Speaker 2>as a professional?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been committed to one thing,</v>

317
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.680
<v Speaker 2>excellence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a golf course in Scotland,</v>

318
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.903
<v Speaker 2>whether it's skyscraper in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's excellence and all he's done is </v>

319
00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:46.214
<v Speaker 2>he's taken that concept and tribes know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>translated it into excellence for </v>

320
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:56.130
<v Speaker 2>America once more and that doesn't fit </v>
<v Speaker 2>into neat neoliberal neo-con,</v>

321
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Paleo calm.</v>

322
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.213
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's about getting stuff done and being </v>

323
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:02.444
<v Speaker 2>the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so how do you link that to what the </v>

324
00:16:04.521 --> 00:16:07.120
<v Speaker 2>general conservative movement is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I get.</v>

325
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I get what you're saying about labels </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I say it all the time.</v>

326
00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:11.300
<v Speaker 2>The labels now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because of trump.</v>

327
00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:13.490
<v Speaker 2>The labels are all the brothers at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

328
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.230
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that I'm struggling to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fully grasp about the trump thing is how</v>

329
00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:20.750
<v Speaker 2>does this connect to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

330
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 2>when I see you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a huge split,</v>

331
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got the trump base and then you've</v>

332
00:16:25.521 --> 00:16:27.740
<v Speaker 2>got the never trumpers and these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

333
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.520
<v Speaker 2>That should be kind of lining up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't quite get there.</v>

334
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.983
<v Speaker 2>And how do you connect those things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you connect what you're </v>

335
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.850
<v Speaker 2>going to connect you to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The never.</v>

336
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Trump has a pathological pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Bill Crystal,</v>

337
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.040
<v Speaker 2>who's all obsequious and oleaginous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me in the greenroom at Fox,</v>

338
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.023
<v Speaker 2>when he tweets out actually tweets out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a choice between the deep state and </v>

339
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.580
<v Speaker 2>president trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I choose the deep state.</v>

340
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill,</v>

341
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a subversive right.</v>

342
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Can get out of the tent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of the tenant.</v>

343
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.153
<v Speaker 2>So that's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The broader question of what does </v>

344
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:04.694
<v Speaker 2>conservative mean today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't answer that because have you </v>

345
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:10.964
<v Speaker 2>seen a good article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really good article which understands </v>

346
00:17:13.521 --> 00:17:17.450
<v Speaker 2>first principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>founding principles about what trump ism</v>

347
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.460
<v Speaker 2>is or should be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

348
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot of people who think they</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what they're talking about,</v>

349
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.563
<v Speaker 2>but who never met the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think with a lot of work to be </v>

350
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:27.524
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to be done by </v>

351
00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:29.534
<v Speaker 2>conservative establishment individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The NRO is not going to tell you who </v>

352
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:34.094
<v Speaker 2>trump is and the NRO is not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>revitalize the conservative </v>

353
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 2>establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

354
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 2>This is a new era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exciting,</v>

355
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.830
<v Speaker 2>but we have to get to work to define </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it means to be a conservative.</v>

356
00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:43.664
<v Speaker 2>So that to me is why it seems so obvious</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're so passionate about this </v>

357
00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:49.050
<v Speaker 2>that nobody else was going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's all.</v>

358
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.973
<v Speaker 2>So that's sorta what Monica was saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's sorta what Horowitz has been </v>

359
00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 2>saying for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when he sat right there that no one</v>

360
00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 2>else was going to break through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now it's imperfect.</v>

361
00:17:58.951 --> 00:17:59.730
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

362
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:00.930
<v Speaker 3>at least there's let.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let,</v>

363
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me be brutally candid.</v>

364
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in the UK to Hungarian parents</v>

365
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:10.140
<v Speaker 3>who escaped communism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went through the private school system</v>

366
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 3>in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stiff upper lip and all that stuff,</v>

367
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:13.464
<v Speaker 3>and the debating club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the precedent style is not exactly </v>

368
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:19.560
<v Speaker 3>the style used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to get used to it.</v>

369
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.210
<v Speaker 3>And I understand when people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

370
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.163
<v Speaker 3>The biggest people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest thing people have issues </v>

371
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:26.190
<v Speaker 3>with on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the right of his tweets.</v>

372
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.710
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But guess what?</v>

373
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Who was going to Defeat Hillary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't Jeb Bush wasn't even sent.</v>

374
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.483
<v Speaker 3>It accrues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of them were going to the only </v>

375
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:38.784
<v Speaker 3>person who could come up through that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Miasma who could break through the ice </v>

376
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 3>of political correctness walls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this rank outsider from Manhattan.</v>

377
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.970
<v Speaker 3>And whether you like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had to say for the Sophocles,</v>

378
00:18:49.971 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 3>he was the necessary but not sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>calls of victory.</v>

379
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to like it,</v>

380
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.680
<v Speaker 3>but it had to be him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With that start,</v>

381
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:05.430
<v Speaker 3>we tried to do marquess of queensberry </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules for 30 years.</v>

382
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:07.980
<v Speaker 3>What did it get us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did it get us?</v>

383
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 3>Mitt Romney among guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

384
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.750
<v Speaker 3>So it had to be Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we have to backfill what it means.</v>

385
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

386
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.273
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to be where I think you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so many of these other people that </v>

387
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Speaker 2>are either part or formerly part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>

388
00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:25.230
<v Speaker 2>So you had a very brief stint at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>

389
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all.</v>

390
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:30.060
<v Speaker 2>And then some years from now they'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad,</v>

391
00:19:30.061 --> 00:19:32.700
<v Speaker 2>he was there for 90 percent longer than </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else,</v>

392
00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 2>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it pretty breached in seven months.</v>

393
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.603
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you just tell me how you got </v>

394
00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:37.254
<v Speaker 2>involved because you had only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just mentioned you only met him a </v>

395
00:19:38.401 --> 00:19:39.234
<v Speaker 2>little bit before the election in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place and then sort of what </v>

396
00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:45.300
<v Speaker 2>happened that had you leave because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>will really tie into the media,</v>

397
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:46.134
<v Speaker 2>which I think we're very much aligned on</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with the media right </v>

398
00:19:48.151 --> 00:19:48.984
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a summer of 15 I got a phone call </v>

399
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:54.720
<v Speaker 2>from a guy called Corey Lewandowski that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard of</v>

400
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.200
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

401
00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:01.230
<v Speaker 3>candidate trump is prepping for the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>full gop presidential debate on national</v>

402
00:20:02.861 --> 00:20:06.640
<v Speaker 3>security.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'd like to talk to you said,</v>

403
00:20:06.641 --> 00:20:08.320
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I took the plane,</v>

404
00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.450
<v Speaker 3>flew to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to trump tower.</v>

405
00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.660
<v Speaker 3>It was just the three of us in Donald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump's office and we had this</v>

406
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.480
<v Speaker 2>incredible blue sky discussion on </v>
<v Speaker 2>national security issues.</v>

407
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.710
<v Speaker 2>You name it from the civil war up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle East,</v>

408
00:20:23.711 --> 00:20:25.430
<v Speaker 2>a nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kinds of topics?</v>

409
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.710
<v Speaker 2>How knowledgeable did he seem about </v>
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>

410
00:20:27.711 --> 00:20:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Because this is one of the parts that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think people we have no handle on,</v>

411
00:20:30.981 --> 00:20:31.814
<v Speaker 2>like does he really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interested but not a guy that </v>

412
00:20:34.551 --> 00:20:37.340
<v Speaker 2>you're going to debate what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Karbala in the ninth century,</v>

413
00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:37.731
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

414
00:20:37.731 --> 00:20:40.040
<v Speaker 2>but really interested in this stuff</v>

415
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.183
<v Speaker 3>and with opinions and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and halfway through this discussion and </v>

416
00:20:44.091 --> 00:20:44.924
<v Speaker 3>he was sitting closer to me than you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>and qualities over here and he does a </v>

417
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 3>classic trumpism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

418
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.943
<v Speaker 3>just stops the conversation with cory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this guy that's hiring and that </v>

419
00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:58.230
<v Speaker 3>was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he asked me to help write.</v>

420
00:20:58.231 --> 00:21:01.030
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't part of the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I became an advisor,</v>

421
00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:01.864
<v Speaker 3>wrote policy papers that he used in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>briefings and we stayed in touch but I </v>

422
00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:06.544
<v Speaker 3>never joined the campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then as things progressed and he </v>

423
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 3>know the field whittled down to what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>

424
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:14.643
<v Speaker 3>I kept meeting General Flynn at events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a participant was just in the </v>

425
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:18.574
<v Speaker 3>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept bumping into General Flynn and </v>

426
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:23.500
<v Speaker 3>I'd known him from when he was directed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to dia and eventually we just.</v>

427
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 3>He pulled me in and by October,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the month before the election,</v>

428
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:33.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're familiar with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>system in the presidential election,</v>

429
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.083
<v Speaker 3>the last two runners get a support from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the federal government before the </v>

430
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.283
<v Speaker 3>election and they get offices near the </v>
<v Speaker 3>White House to create transition teams </v>

431
00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:42.874
<v Speaker 3>to prep.</v>

432
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.833
<v Speaker 3>And so hillary got one story and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the president got another story of </v>

433
00:21:47.031 --> 00:21:48.970
<v Speaker 3>this building and I was pulled into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pet.</v>

434
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:50.410
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the same building.</v>

435
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see if you talk in the elevator.</v>

436
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

437
00:21:55.071 --> 00:21:55.904
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got pulled in and asked to work on </v>

438
00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:58.684
<v Speaker 3>the National Security Council Transition</v>
<v Speaker 3>Team for General Flynn and my wife who </v>

439
00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:05.750
<v Speaker 3>has a background in the issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was pulled into work on the dhs q and a.</v>

440
00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 3>So I became part of the official </v>
<v Speaker 3>transition team.</v>

441
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.423
<v Speaker 3>And up until the very last moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the week before maybe the week of the </v>

442
00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:15.320
<v Speaker 3>inauguration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to be doing counterterrorism</v>

443
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Speaker 3>staff or General Flynn and the NSC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Steve Bannon,</v>

444
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.240
<v Speaker 3>who knows me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaches out at the last minute.</v>

445
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.820
<v Speaker 3>So new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to come and work for me.</v>

446
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:27.280
<v Speaker 3>And the office of the chief strategist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a strategist to the president.</v>

447
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:28.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

448
00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 3>at uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12.</v>

449
00:22:30.821 --> 00:22:31.654
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one on January the 20th I became a </v>

450
00:22:33.371 --> 00:22:34.480
<v Speaker 3>deputy assistant to the president.</v>

451
00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the second that happened,</v>

452
00:22:36.891 --> 00:22:39.020
<v Speaker 4>basically the media just went bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I knew,</v>

453
00:22:39.021 --> 00:22:43.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean every store I mentioned to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>that right now the act where they went</v>

454
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.000
<v Speaker 3>bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it even before that?</v>

455
00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.181
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

456
00:22:45.181 --> 00:22:45.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

457
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.920
<v Speaker 3>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't,</v>

458
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:53.040
<v Speaker 3>they didn't go bananas until the travel </v>
<v Speaker 3>band dropped.</v>

459
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:54.893
<v Speaker 3>And I realized things were not going </v>
<v Speaker 3>well in terms of communicating the </v>

460
00:22:57.841 --> 00:22:58.674
<v Speaker 3>travel ban.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said to Steve and I said to Sean </v>

461
00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.440
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done a bit of media in the past.</v>

462
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.470
<v Speaker 3>I can be the face of this stuff if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

463
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've got the NSC communications </v>
<v Speaker 3>team,</v>

464
00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:12.240
<v Speaker 3>but I'm prepared to go on CNN and debate</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys.</v>

465
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.450
<v Speaker 3>And so they threw me into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

466
00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:16.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

467
00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:18.480
<v Speaker 3>the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I loved it.</v>

468
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:22.440
<v Speaker 3>And the left went nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just absolutely went insane.</v>

469
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:27.690
<v Speaker 3>And it was once I was vehemently </v>
<v Speaker 3>representing the president on television</v>

470
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.450
<v Speaker 3>that out came the hit pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the lights.</v>

471
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.493
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's talk about that a little bit </v>

472
00:23:33.241 --> 00:23:34.074
<v Speaker 4>because I see this happening to almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone that I have any degree of </v>

473
00:23:36.781 --> 00:23:37.790
<v Speaker 4>respect for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see it,</v>

474
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.080
<v Speaker 4>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's coming.</v>

475
00:23:40.081 --> 00:23:41.820
<v Speaker 4>It's coming to me now too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

476
00:23:41.821 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 4>I see this to almost anyone that I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>is trying to be honest.</v>

477
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 4>The endless effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

478
00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.573
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were just endless slew of things </v>

479
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 4>that you're an anti Semite and all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this craziness.</v>

480
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean at the turning point event that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>saw you speak at,</v>

481
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.100
<v Speaker 4>you gave one of the strongest defenses </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Israel that I've ever heard,</v>

482
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.780
<v Speaker 4>but they almost take everything and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>the complete reverse of that.</v>

483
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.103
<v Speaker 4>What do you make of that tactic </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically where it's literally the </v>

484
00:24:05.841 --> 00:24:09.470
<v Speaker 4>reverse of what the truth is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just like we're going to take a</v>

485
00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 4>line and make it seem a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

486
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 4>We're do something that's absolutely.</v>

487
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.390
<v Speaker 3>You've got a big viewership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know your why.</v>

488
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:20.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm no longer a progressive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has got millions of views now.</v>

489
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.113
<v Speaker 3>And I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll open up a little bit the spot size </v>

490
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.510
<v Speaker 3>of your audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

491
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.820
<v Speaker 3>I have a reputation for being a scary </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude and being a hot ass,</v>

492
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:35.263
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after the seven months that I went </v>

493
00:24:37.511 --> 00:24:41.830
<v Speaker 3>through and my family went through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time,</v>

494
00:24:41.831 --> 00:24:42.664
<v Speaker 3>every few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the same emotional response and </v>

495
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.820
<v Speaker 3>it probably surprises your others as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human being.</v>

496
00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:58.380
<v Speaker 3>I want to try and understand how another</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being who's never met me,</v>

497
00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.600
<v Speaker 3>who knows nothing about me or what my </v>
<v Speaker 3>family has been through,</v>

498
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:10.300
<v Speaker 3>can write what they wrote about me will </v>
<v Speaker 3>say what they say about me.</v>

499
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.973
<v Speaker 3>It leaves me speechless that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>have such venomous hatred for somebody </v>

500
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:21.463
<v Speaker 3>and pedal so egregious sets of lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you not only call yourself a </v>

501
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:29.834
<v Speaker 3>journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you actually think you're a human </v>

502
00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:33.150
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

503
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:34.603
<v Speaker 3>I was attacked and that's fine because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a politically commissioned officer </v>

504
00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:39.920
<v Speaker 3>of the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a proxy.</v>

505
00:25:39.921 --> 00:25:42.830
<v Speaker 3>I was approximate for Steve as a proxy </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the president.</v>

506
00:25:42.831 --> 00:25:44.510
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's okay,</v>

507
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.703
<v Speaker 3>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't we debate the policies they </v>

508
00:25:47.061 --> 00:25:47.894
<v Speaker 3>never wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never wanted to debate the policies was </v>

509
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.850
<v Speaker 3>ad hominem attacks and lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And secondly,</v>

510
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.030
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to attack me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>

511
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not a kate attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife.</v>

512
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.943
<v Speaker 3>It's not okay to attack my dead mother's</v>
<v Speaker 3>reputation and it's not okay to attack </v>

513
00:26:04.851 --> 00:26:05.684
<v Speaker 3>my teenage high school age son either </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people are reprehensible and </v>

514
00:26:11.681 --> 00:26:12.850
<v Speaker 3>they're out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>David.</v>

515
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.780
<v Speaker 3>And then not learning the doubling down.</v>

516
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.110
<v Speaker 4>So that's the part that I'm concerned </v>
<v Speaker 4>about right now that it seat.</v>

517
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.610
<v Speaker 4>People always asked me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did an event in Irvine last night and,</v>

518
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.120
<v Speaker 4>and the question I'm getting more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more now is,</v>

519
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:26.983
<v Speaker 4>is this thing turning around now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sense my sense is that there is </v>

520
00:26:31.251 --> 00:26:34.880
<v Speaker 4>something brewing against it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something brewing finally,</v>

521
00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.000
<v Speaker 4>and I think any of us in this space or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little piece of it,</v>

522
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.163
<v Speaker 4>but to me it's going to get a lot worse </v>
<v Speaker 4>before it gets better and that that's </v>

523
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:42.770
<v Speaker 4>what I'm concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

524
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 4>you're already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I suspect</v>

525
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.173
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under what conditions does something </v>

526
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:50.550
<v Speaker 3>like that change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we rule out violence,</v>

527
00:26:50.551 --> 00:26:52.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to have violence.</v>

528
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:52.944
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>

529
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

530
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:56.430
<v Speaker 3>the worst war we ever had was all civil </v>
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>

531
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six hundred thousand Americans killed.</v>

532
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Even though they're subtly condoning </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>

533
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.080
<v Speaker 3>CEO of twitter is condoning it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

534
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.700
<v Speaker 3>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

535
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.330
<v Speaker 3>let's pray to the good Lord that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not where we're going.</v>

536
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 3>What's the other option?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the other scenario that they look</v>

537
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:15.774
<v Speaker 3>in the mirror and they stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one would thing they reward each </v>

538
00:27:21.001 --> 00:27:23.850
<v Speaker 3>other for the lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

539
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 3>look at Time Magazine's latest issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a for Rango of lines.</v>

540
00:27:28.411 --> 00:27:31.050
<v Speaker 3>It's all opinion pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not journalism.</v>

541
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 3>When they look at the people who they </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrate at their get togethers,</v>

542
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.833
<v Speaker 3>they're not journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's maybe six journalists </v>

543
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:40.284
<v Speaker 3>left in this country that are actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing investigative research like Sarah </v>

544
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 3>Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

545
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.263
<v Speaker 3>Like Molly Hemingway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When are they going to be recognized by </v>

546
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:52.050
<v Speaker 3>the Washington press corps?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never,</v>

547
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.393
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't comport with the </v>

548
00:27:54.571 --> 00:27:59.571
<v Speaker 3>narrative that we're Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the president is a dictator.</v>

549
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.740
<v Speaker 3>This is a man whose grandchildren are </v>
<v Speaker 3>orthodox Jews.</v>

550
00:28:04.741 --> 00:28:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Can you wrap your heads around it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York Times,</v>

551
00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:08.550
<v Speaker 3>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huffington Post,</v>

552
00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:09.384
<v Speaker 3>buzzfeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll reprehensible for calling this </v>

553
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 3>administration what you call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that he doesn't,</v>

554
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.360
<v Speaker 3>not that he doesn't have a racist bone </v>
<v Speaker 3>in his body.</v>

555
00:28:18.361 --> 00:28:21.120
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have a racist molecule in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

556
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.920
<v Speaker 3>The stunning thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

557
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.953
<v Speaker 3>this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why it was such an honor to work for </v>

558
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:26.574
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stunning thing about Donald trump </v>

559
00:28:27.961 --> 00:28:29.680
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look,</v>

560
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.720
<v Speaker 3>I got a Bible in my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can swear on it.</v>

561
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:38.520
<v Speaker 3>I'll swear on this Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This man wants only two things.</v>

562
00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:39.354
<v Speaker 3>We're all Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants you and your family to be safe </v>

563
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.073
<v Speaker 3>and he wants you to prosper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what all American president </v>

564
00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:47.340
<v Speaker 3>should want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know it's starting,</v>

565
00:28:47.341 --> 00:28:48.174
<v Speaker 3>David.</v>

566
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.980
<v Speaker 3>He wants that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not you voted for him or not,</v>

567
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.170
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't care whether you voted for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary.</v>

568
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:56.004
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't care whether you want to burn</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all and he doesn't care whether you </v>

569
00:28:58.201 --> 00:28:59.034
<v Speaker 3>stayed at home and ate doritos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're an American living here </v>

570
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.010
<v Speaker 3>legally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants you to be safe from harm,</v>

571
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:06.210
<v Speaker 3>from gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from terrorism,</v>

572
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.180
<v Speaker 3>and he wants you to prosper like he has </v>
<v Speaker 3>prospered.</v>

573
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 3>And the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the answer to your question.</v>

574
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.690
<v Speaker 3>The left will never ever believed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although it is true and I tested it.</v>

575
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.610
<v Speaker 3>So when they put you out there and as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you said you.</v>

576
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:23.861
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

577
00:29:23.861 --> 00:29:24.090
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

578
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:24.541
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

579
00:29:24.541 --> 00:29:25.650
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's all about,</v>

580
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:26.580
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's all about.</v>

581
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:27.414
<v Speaker 3>What you just said there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they put you out there and as you </v>

582
00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:31.280
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you willfully went out to,</v>

583
00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.540
<v Speaker 3>to go for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the ban the Muslim ban.</v>

584
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.270
<v Speaker 3>I when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

585
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 3>when we talked about it on our tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm glad for it to their narrative.</v>

586
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.633
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we talked about it a bunch of the </v>

587
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

588
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.110
<v Speaker 4>did a bunch of videos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried to be very fair.</v>

589
00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:44.983
<v Speaker 4>I have Muslim friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had Muslims on the show and ex </v>

590
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:49.450
<v Speaker 4>Muslims and I've had people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>critical of religion and people that are</v>

591
00:29:49.451 --> 00:29:51.520
<v Speaker 4>religious in the whole freaking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

592
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.413
<v Speaker 4>most of the countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most of the most populous countries </v>

593
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:56.260
<v Speaker 4>of Muslim people were not included on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the band.</v>

594
00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:57.094
<v Speaker 4>The original list,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the original list was Oklahoma by the </v>

595
00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:00.970
<v Speaker 4>Obama administration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that.</v>

596
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 4>So I tried to talk about it as fairly as</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible,</v>

597
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:04.534
<v Speaker 4>but it seems to be one of those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I think this will sort of lead </v>

598
00:30:07.781 --> 00:30:08.614
<v Speaker 4>us a little bit into your book as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about radical Islam and trying </v>

599
00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:17.161
<v Speaker 4>to make the distinction between Islam as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a set of ideas versus Muslims as people.</v>

600
00:30:17.201 --> 00:30:19.540
<v Speaker 4>And of course you shouldn't be prejudice</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of that.</v>

601
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.430
<v Speaker 4>This seems to be basically the stickiest</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that we have going right now,</v>

602
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:25.264
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the quicksand to even talk about </v>

603
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:27.904
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

604
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

605
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.990
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mean the threat,</v>

606
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.070
<v Speaker 4>the threat of jihadism?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

607
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:32.933
<v Speaker 4>just trying to kind of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>so well the quicksand of trying to make </v>

608
00:30:38.971 --> 00:30:39.804
<v Speaker 4>the distinction of we have to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about ideas and what we have to </v>

609
00:30:42.511 --> 00:30:44.370
<v Speaker 4>fight for good ideas and against bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas,</v>

610
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.580
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not being prejudice towards people</v>

611
00:30:47.581 --> 00:30:50.430
<v Speaker 4>and making sure that America remains the</v>
<v Speaker 4>open plurals,</v>

612
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:52.170
<v Speaker 4>pluralistic society that it is.</v>

613
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Look at the argument in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my book,</v>

614
00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:57.240
<v Speaker 3>different jihad is a very simple one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

615
00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.613
<v Speaker 3>we live in the only country ever created</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the principle of individual freedom </v>

616
00:31:04.571 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 3>and liberties and granted to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not by the government,</v>

617
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.180
<v Speaker 3>but by our creative because we are made </v>
<v Speaker 3>in his image,</v>

618
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:13.870
<v Speaker 3>not the founding fathers said you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have dignity because you all made in</v>

619
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:14.704
<v Speaker 3>the image of the creator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not because Washington says you have </v>

620
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:16.864
<v Speaker 3>dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that concept of the individual's </v>

621
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.753
<v Speaker 3>dignity and the freedom that it provides</v>
<v Speaker 3>is antithetical to the spectrum of </v>

622
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:33.060
<v Speaker 3>politics that says manage perfectible </v>
<v Speaker 3>and perfection can be created in real.</v>

623
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.310
<v Speaker 3>My first degree was philosophy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>theology.</v>

624
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:37.790
<v Speaker 3>And I study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

625
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.070
<v Speaker 3>this event here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All politics can be,</v>

626
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.740
<v Speaker 3>can be all ideological differences can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be summarized in just two camps.</v>

627
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:47.050
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter which country you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>in or what era,</v>

628
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.063
<v Speaker 3>two camps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those that believe truth is objective </v>

629
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.000
<v Speaker 3>and not manmade.</v>

630
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.870
<v Speaker 3>And those who say no man can define </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth and perfection can be created here</v>

631
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:56.704
<v Speaker 3>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This statement that man defines truth </v>

632
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.220
<v Speaker 3>leads to the gas chambers and to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gulags.</v>

633
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

634
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.250
<v Speaker 3>social justice warriors don't realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're walking down the same path,</v>

635
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.480
<v Speaker 3>but it's the same concept to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to perfect the world and there</v>

636
00:32:13.481 --> 00:32:16.210
<v Speaker 3>will be justice and equality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

637
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.980
<v Speaker 3>you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we are free,</v>

638
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.330
<v Speaker 3>there will never be justice for all and </v>
<v Speaker 3>equality for all,</v>

639
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.180
<v Speaker 3>as long as we are free because evil is </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

640
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:26.343
<v Speaker 3>Evil exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man is fallen and jihadism is just the </v>

641
00:32:30.911 --> 00:32:33.160
<v Speaker 3>latest version.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my book is a very simple argument.</v>

642
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.093
<v Speaker 3>There is a connective tissue between al </v>
<v Speaker 3>Qaeda and Isis and the Nazis of the </v>

643
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Third Reich and the comments of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Union.</v>

644
00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:42.723
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they watch different things on worship </v>

645
00:32:43.841 --> 00:32:45.710
<v Speaker 3>and Erin Rice when we should work in </v>
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>

646
00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:47.600
<v Speaker 3>the other worship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that version of Islam,</v>

647
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.230
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>

648
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:49.063
<v Speaker 3>The connective tissues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all totalitarians and if you </v>

649
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:53.120
<v Speaker 3>disagree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

650
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be enslaved or murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>End of story and if you.</v>

651
00:32:57.021 --> 00:32:59.660
<v Speaker 3>If you deny that reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've trained,</v>

652
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

653
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 3>$7,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal officers.</v>

654
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I've trained more than that in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military.</v>

655
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 3>When the military professional and FBI </v>
<v Speaker 3>agent understands that his government is</v>

656
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:15.410
<v Speaker 3>telling him what he can or cannot say </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the threat group is supposed to be</v>

657
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:16.244
<v Speaker 3>protecting us from then we have problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>when President Obama says in a 2011 </v>

658
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:23.114
<v Speaker 3>writes a memo to the chairman of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>joint chiefs and the then attorney </v>

659
00:33:25.581 --> 00:33:26.414
<v Speaker 3>general all counter terrorism training </v>
<v Speaker 3>of FBI agents and the US military must </v>

660
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:34.850
<v Speaker 3>not mention Islam and especially must </v>
<v Speaker 3>not mention the word Jihad.</v>

661
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.463
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like saying we're about to storm </v>

662
00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:41.480
<v Speaker 3>the Normandy beaches and guys make sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're [inaudible] one's loaded and your</v>

663
00:33:41.481 --> 00:33:43.910
<v Speaker 3>boots are tied up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever you do,</v>

664
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:47.870
<v Speaker 3>don't mention the word Nazi because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could offend a German.</v>

665
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad snl skit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>David.</v>

666
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:51.643
<v Speaker 3>It's insanity and the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't allowed to talk about it </v>

667
00:33:54.141 --> 00:33:56.450
<v Speaker 3>truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets people killed.</v>

668
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Political correctness</v>

669
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.280
<v Speaker 4>eventually can lead to good people </v>
<v Speaker 4>dying,</v>

670
00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 4>so that also explains why there's such </v>
<v Speaker 4>craziness in Europe right now.</v>

671
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

672
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.693
<v Speaker 4>we're going to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that we're going to </v>

673
00:34:08.541 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 4>consistently see the rise of right or </v>
<v Speaker 4>far right parties,</v>

674
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:17.860
<v Speaker 4>but it really is just the symptom of not</v>
<v Speaker 4>being able to talk about these issues.</v>

675
00:34:18.441 --> 00:34:19.020
<v Speaker 4>Honestly.</v>

676
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Let's differentiate between the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 3>two different things.</v>

677
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

678
00:34:22.381 --> 00:34:24.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've just had an election in Hungary.</v>

679
00:34:24.481 --> 00:34:27.270
<v Speaker 3>We've seen the elections in Italy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>elsewhere and we've seen brexit.</v>

680
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Let's don't conflate two issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the rise of very disturbing,</v>

681
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.273
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>groups like your back in Hungary that </v>

682
00:34:33.621 --> 00:34:36.640
<v Speaker 3>are really crypto nationalists and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and feed off a,</v>

683
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.900
<v Speaker 3>a long seated antisemitic kind of era </v>
<v Speaker 3>dentist,</v>

684
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.900
<v Speaker 3>a sentiment in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are the true</v>

685
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.820
<v Speaker 4>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not all white nationalists,</v>

686
00:34:44.821 --> 00:34:47.440
<v Speaker 4>but the true sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want ethno state and they want,</v>

687
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:48.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

688
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's complicated because as history that</v>

689
00:34:50.011 --> 00:34:52.870
<v Speaker 3>has tree and on this side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that big.</v>

690
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little nuggets.</v>

691
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that you mustn't conflate that with</v>

692
00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.070
<v Speaker 3>the trump phenomena and things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>brexit,</v>

693
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.650
<v Speaker 3>original,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a causation,</v>

694
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.330
<v Speaker 3>and I don't even use the word populism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I reject the word populism,</v>

695
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.740
<v Speaker 3>unless your definition is part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>populism is a,</v>

696
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.510
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of politics that the elite </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagrees with.</v>

697
00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:17.003
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

698
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that's not the standard </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

699
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.860
<v Speaker 3>This isn't populism that trump winning </v>
<v Speaker 3>or brexit happening.</v>

700
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:26.020
<v Speaker 3>This is a reassertion of democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean why?</v>

701
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.700
<v Speaker 3>Why did trump occur?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because people on the left and the right</v>

702
00:35:29.701 --> 00:35:32.640
<v Speaker 3>looked at DC and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

703
00:35:32.641 --> 00:35:34.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunni and Shia,</v>

704
00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:36.510
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's broken.</v>

705
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what a federal</v>

706
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.083
<v Speaker 2>budget should look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were spending like drunken </v>

707
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:41.454
<v Speaker 2>sailors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's the reassertion of accountable </v>

708
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:44.784
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice faceless bureaucracy or uni party </v>

709
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:52.080
<v Speaker 2>swamp to others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're in DC or whether they're</v>

710
00:35:52.081 --> 00:35:53.850
<v Speaker 2>in Brussels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me it should be.</v>

711
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.893
<v Speaker 2>We should welcome it with open arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a reassertion of accountable </v>

712
00:35:58.771 --> 00:35:59.604
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the left that wants uniformity </v>

713
00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:04.770
<v Speaker 2>of thought and bigger government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascism.</v>

714
00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 2>So how does the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do then does the right.</v>

715
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:08.873
<v Speaker 2>How do you police that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that you don't like that idea of </v>

716
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:12.500
<v Speaker 2>policing and government coming in fixing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

717
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.343
<v Speaker 2>but how do you make sure that the part </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're worried about doesn't lead </v>

718
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:19.470
<v Speaker 2>to the good part?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think from the way,</v>

719
00:36:19.471 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 2>at least from the way I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left is always lead now by its worst</v>

720
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.230
<v Speaker 2>parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for them,</v>

721
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:25.410
<v Speaker 2>that's why they purge everybody.</v>

722
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.090
<v Speaker 2>The video that you mentioned that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm praying for you.</v>

723
00:36:27.091 --> 00:36:27.901
<v Speaker 2>That's what I talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

724
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:28.734
<v Speaker 2>anyone that steps out of group think you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get purged and that's why I think </v>

725
00:36:31.891 --> 00:36:32.724
<v Speaker 2>there's such a movement towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism or classical liberalism </v>

726
00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 2>or whatever you wanna call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I see what the left's doing on that.</v>

727
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:38.604
<v Speaker 2>How do you make sure that doesn't happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the right where the far right that </v>

728
00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:41.874
<v Speaker 2>you were worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it's fair estimation to call </v>

729
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:44.540
<v Speaker 2>it fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

730
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like the alt right.</v>

731
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's bogus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those are just.</v>

732
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a new label for nationalist or or</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

733
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.490
<v Speaker 2>or incidental bigots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

734
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:56.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a reader that re wrapping </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to be solid.</v>

735
00:36:56.641 --> 00:36:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Faith will be fit for polite company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

736
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.053
<v Speaker 2>I hate to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to tell you on your wikipedia </v>

737
00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:02.910
<v Speaker 2>page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it calls you all right.</v>

738
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

739
00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.793
<v Speaker 2>And offset the page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't allow the subject to </v>

740
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 2>correct when I try and correct the lies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's frozen.</v>

741
00:37:13.381 --> 00:37:14.790
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wikipedia you.</v>

742
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:15.624
<v Speaker 2>I told you right before we started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your wikipedia out of all of the </v>

743
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:19.020
<v Speaker 2>ones that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I usually just glance there,</v>

744
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.863
<v Speaker 2>not for fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just to get a sense of what's going </v>

745
00:37:21.681 --> 00:37:23.070
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yours is such a mess.</v>

746
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.540
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried.</v>

747
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to correct the friends who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have tried to correct it.</v>

748
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Then they froze it and then forget about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

749
00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:30.204
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do though to make sure </v>

750
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.350
<v Speaker 2>that those two songs don't come?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to spine.</v>

751
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:38.580
<v Speaker 2>So those of us that have a podium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those that are out there,</v>

752
00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:43.581
<v Speaker 2>those that wish to see the principles we</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in in terms of the founding come</v>

753
00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:44.604
<v Speaker 2>back and be celebrated in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to call them out like we don't </v>

754
00:37:47.491 --> 00:37:50.310
<v Speaker 2>believe that you use legislation.</v>

755
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me a break.</v>

756
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either you're inciting violence,</v>

757
00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:54.504
<v Speaker 2>so you will not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either you're committing a crime or </v>

758
00:37:55.321 --> 00:37:57.900
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need extra labels and we don't.</v>

759
00:37:57.901 --> 00:38:01.460
<v Speaker 2>It's censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call them out for what they need.</v>

760
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.750
<v Speaker 2>People on the right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

761
00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.210
<v Speaker 2>He's a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

762
00:38:05.211 --> 00:38:06.840
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think that's just bigotry.</v>

763
00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:09.650
<v Speaker 2>That's just the KKK wrapped up in a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>bow.</v>

764
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.590
<v Speaker 2>It's up to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's happening?</v>

765
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.130
<v Speaker 2>That's not gonna do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

766
00:38:14.131 --> 00:38:14.964
<v Speaker 2>They're going to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to use those people to silence </v>

767
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:20.160
<v Speaker 2>the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that went not enough?</v>

768
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Not Enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by far,</v>

769
00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have um,</v>

770
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.630
<v Speaker 2>begun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of work to do.</v>

771
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:28.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does everything that's happening in </v>

772
00:38:30.451 --> 00:38:31.284
<v Speaker 2>Europe right now and there's definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>a distinction to be made between what's </v>

773
00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 2>happening in eastern Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Western Europe</v>

774
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.980
<v Speaker 4>and Eastern Europe I think is dealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with some of their existential crisis.</v>

775
00:38:39.981 --> 00:38:40.814
<v Speaker 4>He's a little bit better perhaps because</v>
<v Speaker 4>western Europe still a little behind on </v>

776
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 4>the political correctness stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about.</v>

777
00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 4>Does everything that's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe right now?</v>

778
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Does it all come down to immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think?</v>

779
00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:52.520
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

780
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:53.803
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

781
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.000
<v Speaker 3>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

782
00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.270
<v Speaker 3>was the blue touch paper on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>firework?</v>

783
00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.300
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

784
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.240
<v Speaker 3>it's the death of representative </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy.</v>

785
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:06.663
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched this because I grew up in the </v>

786
00:39:08.391 --> 00:39:10.940
<v Speaker 3>UK under Margaret Thatcher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

787
00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.013
<v Speaker 3>Maggie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gipper blessed St John Paul the </v>

788
00:39:15.741 --> 00:39:17.270
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These were my heroes.</v>

789
00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.193
<v Speaker 3>I remember riding to school on the bus </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning in west London and the </v>

790
00:39:25.191 --> 00:39:26.024
<v Speaker 3>bus driver would be Jamaican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be with my Indian or Pakistani </v>

791
00:39:29.061 --> 00:39:31.580
<v Speaker 3>school body I with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this Polish guy next to me.</v>

792
00:39:31.581 --> 00:39:32.414
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's super hydrogenous part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>London and as far as far as I was </v>

793
00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:36.980
<v Speaker 3>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are all Brits.</v>

794
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.830
<v Speaker 3>The guy must've might've had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thickest Jamaican accent possible.</v>

795
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:40.610
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

796
00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.190
<v Speaker 3>my friend Martin's mom cooked the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indian cars,</v>

797
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.780
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all British.</v>

798
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gone.</v>

799
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:47.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Tony Black came in,</v>

800
00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.210
<v Speaker 3>when Clinton came in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that,</v>

801
00:39:50.211 --> 00:39:51.044
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the West is guilty and words like </v>

802
00:39:54.951 --> 00:39:55.784
<v Speaker 3>British,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pejorative to your wealth or whatever </v>

803
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.930
<v Speaker 3>that was the death of these countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

804
00:40:02.931 --> 00:40:06.920
<v Speaker 3>why do you think I'm in America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a proud American citizen now because</v>

805
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.153
<v Speaker 3>they lost the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The things that the Gi guys that fought </v>

806
00:40:11.961 --> 00:40:16.961
<v Speaker 3>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Tommy's fought for make safe spaces,</v>

807
00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:18.893
<v Speaker 3>really got 19 year olds that are being </v>
<v Speaker 3>blown up over Berlin and bomber planes </v>

808
00:40:23.341 --> 00:40:27.420
<v Speaker 3>and you want a safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is in a space of 70 years.</v>

809
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in London right now?</v>

810
00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Here's the line of Churchill.</v>

811
00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:34.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's shocking.</v>

812
00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.150
<v Speaker 4>So I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you saw this,</v>

813
00:40:36.151 --> 00:40:38.580
<v Speaker 4>but just in the last couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 4>they said London's crime.</v>

814
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:42.270
<v Speaker 4>Violent crime has now surpassed New York</v>
<v Speaker 4>cities for the first time in history.</v>

815
00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.100
<v Speaker 4>And then Cindy Kahn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's the mayor,</v>

816
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.440
<v Speaker 4>a statement saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't carry knives.</v>

817
00:40:46.441 --> 00:40:47.161
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first off,</v>

818
00:40:47.161 --> 00:40:48.780
<v Speaker 4>people are walking out with Swiss army </v>
<v Speaker 4>knives,</v>

819
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.550
<v Speaker 4>a woman that might want to protect </v>
<v Speaker 4>herself.</v>

820
00:40:50.551 --> 00:40:53.610
<v Speaker 4>My one have a knife in her pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it.</v>

821
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:56.220
<v Speaker 4>It seems like a mass mental disorder to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

822
00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.820
<v Speaker 3>but that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the natural progression when you</v>

823
00:41:00.821 --> 00:41:04.660
<v Speaker 3>deny objective truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If everything is plastic,</v>

824
00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.713
<v Speaker 3>then you will get wrapped around your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own act solely in absurdities and for </v>

825
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 3>for mayor of one of the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities in the world of financial centers</v>

826
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:17.671
<v Speaker 3>to say no one should ever have a knife </v>
<v Speaker 3>on them and nobody needs a knife.</v>

827
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.370
<v Speaker 3>So every plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every tradesman,</v>

828
00:41:21.371 --> 00:41:25.030
<v Speaker 3>every person working at the fish market </v>
<v Speaker 3>is suddenly out of a job.</v>

829
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.820
<v Speaker 3>So conduit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

830
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.713
<v Speaker 4>So what does your Britain or Europe in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>wider sense have to do to reverse the </v>

831
00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>tide on</v>

832
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 2>some of this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

833
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Nigel Farrage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

834
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.653
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's lucky that the saying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>crops up in every nation and every </v>

835
00:41:41.991 --> 00:41:43.970
<v Speaker 2>country deserves the politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They elect.</v>

836
00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.213
<v Speaker 3>Don't bitch and Moan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get up the street where I live outside </v>

837
00:41:50.521 --> 00:41:53.280
<v Speaker 3>DC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're the conservatives who's so</v>

838
00:41:53.281 --> 00:41:55.860
<v Speaker 3>fed up and they're constantly posting </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff on facebook.</v>

839
00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.320
<v Speaker 3>What have you done to do something about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

840
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.143
<v Speaker 3>Have you gone out with leaflets?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you given more than $5 to a local </v>

841
00:42:03.991 --> 00:42:05.920
<v Speaker 3>candidate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you given up and surrender?</v>

842
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:08.310
<v Speaker 3>I see this all the time that people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

843
00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:10.020
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest nation on earth,</v>

844
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:11.340
<v Speaker 3>and then they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

845
00:42:11.341 --> 00:42:15.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going purple and bureaucrats moved</v>

846
00:42:15.061 --> 00:42:17.940
<v Speaker 3>in and what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>

847
00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.300
<v Speaker 3>Would you have said that in 17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>76,</v>

848
00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.750
<v Speaker 3>the founding fathers have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do?</v>

849
00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:25.970
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

850
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:26.803
<v Speaker 2>Is this just a symptom of the success of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the West that we've just become so </v>

851
00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:31.034
<v Speaker 2>successful that you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kind of sit there and we sit on </v>

852
00:42:32.931 --> 00:42:35.990
<v Speaker 2>twitter and we complain all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're all talking.</v>

853
00:42:35.991 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 2>We're not doing anything like it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

854
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:41.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not do a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much more than that.</v>

855
00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 2>It's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

856
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the Jesuits.</v>

857
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I studied philosophy under them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was painful,</v>

858
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:49.310
<v Speaker 2>but I will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't regret a minute of it.</v>

859
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Identity is a function of history and </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture and values and if,</v>

860
00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:02.910
<v Speaker 3>if you don't study Western civilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your schools colleges,</v>

861
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.963
<v Speaker 3>this is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't understand why people have </v>

862
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:10.970
<v Speaker 3>dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that they do.</v>

863
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless that conservatives,</v>

864
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.083
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where you arrive at and and you </v>

865
00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:18.800
<v Speaker 3>know who's responsible for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't play in the Left,</v>

866
00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:19.840
<v Speaker 3>David.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not the.</v>

867
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 3>This is not the left's culpability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ours.</v>

868
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:26.930
<v Speaker 3>It's the conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The radicals,</v>

869
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.063
<v Speaker 3>when they saw Paris and fire in 1968,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believed that they could do the segment </v>

870
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:32.703
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we could have a left wing </v>

871
00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:34.634
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what your students were </v>

872
00:43:35.691 --> 00:43:38.360
<v Speaker 3>democratic society believed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when Bernadine,</v>

873
00:43:38.361 --> 00:43:43.361
<v Speaker 3>dohrn and bill as took over the SDS and </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to execute the Chicago days of rage.</v>

874
00:43:43.611 --> 00:43:48.380
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because Americans are not rabble rousing</v>

875
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:52.670
<v Speaker 3>a leftists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It died.</v>

876
00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:54.500
<v Speaker 3>It was a damp squib article there.</v>

877
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Maoist revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

878
00:43:56.411 --> 00:43:57.171
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>

879
00:43:57.171 --> 00:44:00.410
<v Speaker 3>The prairie fire manifesto died </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantly.</v>

880
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:04.730
<v Speaker 3>So what did they decide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd read that Trotsky.</v>

881
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:05.860
<v Speaker 3>They'd read their lending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They even knew.</v>

882
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:06.783
<v Speaker 3>Hitler said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me that children and our own their </v>

883
00:44:08.731 --> 00:44:09.564
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people actually became tenured </v>

884
00:44:11.631 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 3>professors in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They became high school teachers.</v>

885
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.990
<v Speaker 3>And what did we do on the right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We let them.</v>

886
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:21.980
<v Speaker 3>People who are avowedly believe America </v>
<v Speaker 3>is evil.</v>

887
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:27.230
<v Speaker 3>We're allowed to influence our education</v>
<v Speaker 3>system to the point at which they pretty</v>

888
00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:28.650
<v Speaker 3>much owned it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with exceptional,</v>

889
00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 3>your hillsdale and grove city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they own the education</v>

890
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.770
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was our response?</v>

891
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Homeschooling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

892
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I love the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to save,</v>

893
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.230
<v Speaker 2>but that ain't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ain't enough.</v>

894
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

895
00:44:44.161 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be a hard slog.</v>

896
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years of saying guys,</v>

897
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 2>America means this and it's nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with your skin color.</v>

898
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.430
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing to do with your sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>preference,</v>

899
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.200
<v Speaker 2>your social class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your gender.</v>

900
00:44:55.320 --> 00:45:00.320
<v Speaker 2>America is eternal values and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gonna be a lot of work.</v>

901
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.213
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to shift a little bit to </v>

902
00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:05.840
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy because I think that sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>

903
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 2>one of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of your.</v>

904
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Would you say that's one of your main </v>
<v Speaker 2>strengths?</v>

905
00:45:08.931 --> 00:45:09.764
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

906
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.660
<v Speaker 2>my claim to fame is counter terrorism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like this.</v>

907
00:45:12.661 --> 00:45:13.494
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really deep down I'm a strategy </v>

908
00:45:15.031 --> 00:45:17.220
<v Speaker 2>wank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grand Strategy is my thing.</v>

909
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll talk.</v>

910
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.190
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk in the language and strategy </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

911
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 2>So as we're taping this right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned earlier,</v>

912
00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:24.820
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna sit on the shelf for a couple</v>

913
00:45:24.821 --> 00:45:25.654
<v Speaker 2>of days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to get too lost in </v>

914
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:28.164
<v Speaker 2>anything that happened today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the moment it's a little upside </v>

915
00:45:30.091 --> 00:45:30.924
<v Speaker 2>down in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know there might've been strikes </v>

916
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:33.144
<v Speaker 2>already from when we're taping this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hungry just had elections in your </v>

917
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:38.304
<v Speaker 2>wikipedia that I referenced earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says you worked for the guy who just </v>

918
00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.380
<v Speaker 2>won you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently you never worked for him.</v>

919
00:45:43.381 --> 00:45:46.490
<v Speaker 2>He told his potty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't victim to Audubon's advising,</v>

920
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.540
<v Speaker 2>which is what it says on Wikipedia at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>

921
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.531
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

922
00:45:49.531 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 2>what's your general thoughts on foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy strategy?</v>

923
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:58.131
<v Speaker 2>Like what is a sensible policy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie's trump applying that view?</v>

924
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first things first.</v>

925
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great irony of all nation is that we</v>

926
00:46:04.051 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 2>are the most powerful nation in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world has ever seen.</v>

927
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.170
<v Speaker 2>And until recently we have been the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumbest and most a strategic.</v>

928
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.213
<v Speaker 2>I mean we haven't done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't thought or acted </v>

929
00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:15.163
<v Speaker 2>strategically since about 1989.</v>
<v Speaker 2>November the ninth when the Berlin Wall </v>

930
00:46:18.391 --> 00:46:19.210
<v Speaker 2>fell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

931
00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.130
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

932
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:22.000
<v Speaker 2>how have we acted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

933
00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:26.040
<v Speaker 2>what would you say that since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just nineties was just this kind of</v>

934
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:30.550
<v Speaker 2>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is national security about lurching</v>

935
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:31.463
<v Speaker 2>for the snooze button,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just who are the threats is that China </v>

936
00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:36.450
<v Speaker 2>is a weapons of mass destruction and say</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just love it.</v>

937
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.433
<v Speaker 2>It was just a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we had 2001 and nine slash 11 </v>

938
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:45.860
<v Speaker 2>and we had just as neo-con disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an accident.</v>

939
00:46:46.201 --> 00:46:47.034
<v Speaker 2>These guys were former trotskyites </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're so naive the way they </v>

940
00:46:49.921 --> 00:46:50.754
<v Speaker 2>look at the world that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create democracy at the end of a gun </v>

941
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:54.953
<v Speaker 2>barrel in a country with 36 languages </v>
<v Speaker 2>that defeated Alexander the Great and </v>

942
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:03.870
<v Speaker 2>the British empire and the Soviets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't be stupid or if you tried.</v>

943
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.973
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

944
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done some very,</v>

945
00:47:06.601 --> 00:47:10.020
<v Speaker 2>very foolish things because we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck to the basics.</v>

946
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Strategy at the end of the day is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing.</v>

947
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:16.860
<v Speaker 2>It's about prioritization based upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>

948
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:20.730
<v Speaker 2>But you've got to say some things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>more important than others.</v>

949
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:21.623
<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some countries are more important than </v>

950
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:26.490
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a postmodern secular world,</v>

951
00:47:26.491 --> 00:47:28.870
<v Speaker 2>you'll not allowed or no countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

952
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Vanuatu is as</v>

953
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:30.903
<v Speaker 3>important as Turkey wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I love the people that a </v>

954
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:34.121
<v Speaker 3>while too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

955
00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:37.900
<v Speaker 3>it's not a geo strategic import to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the country of America.</v>

956
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:38.943
<v Speaker 3>So number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to prioritize and I think this </v>

957
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:42.064
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dock my cap to Nadia shadow a HR </v>

958
00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:46.693
<v Speaker 3>mcmasters deputy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She held the pen in the meetings that I </v>

959
00:47:48.431 --> 00:47:51.310
<v Speaker 3>was in on the new national security </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy of America.</v>

960
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:55.390
<v Speaker 3>And I tell you David,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the first document of that name in</v>

961
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:58.930
<v Speaker 3>steady is that deserves the name </v>
<v Speaker 3>national security strategy.</v>

962
00:47:58.931 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Every administration has them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the first one that says,</v>

963
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:03.970
<v Speaker 3>this is what we stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are our values,</v>

964
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.833
<v Speaker 3>these are our friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are our enemies and this is what </v>

965
00:48:06.701 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 3>we're going to prioritize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prior to that,</v>

966
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 3>it was laundry lists of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we're going to have to front walls,</v>

967
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:14.460
<v Speaker 3>we're going to save the whales and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know know.</v>

968
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:19.180
<v Speaker 3>So you have to prioritize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And finally this administration is about</v>

969
00:48:19.181 --> 00:48:22.570
<v Speaker 3>America first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are not isolationists,</v>

970
00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:23.523
<v Speaker 3>nor are we interventionists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really annoys me that if you're </v>

971
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 3>a conservative for 20 years you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>given two options,</v>

972
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:34.830
<v Speaker 3>button a invade other people's countries</v>
<v Speaker 3>and occupy them button.</v>

973
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Be be a Randy Sta and close the curtains</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the Pacific and the Atlantic and say,</v>

974
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.753
<v Speaker 3>we don't care about anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well guess what is the most powerful </v>

975
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:47.950
<v Speaker 3>nation in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a large pallet of options.</v>

976
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.300
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be something in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

977
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's about being smart.</v>

978
00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:57.190
<v Speaker 3>It's about our interests and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To summarize the president's approach,</v>

979
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.840
<v Speaker 3>this isn't official,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I like it.</v>

980
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 3>We have numerous former generals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>active generals from the Marine Corps at</v>

981
00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:05.800
<v Speaker 3>the highest level of administration </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed the joint chiefs,</v>

982
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Chief of staff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>secretary defense.</v>

983
00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:08.853
<v Speaker 3>And the interesting thing is they all </v>
<v Speaker 3>come from the same Marine Corps </v>

984
00:49:10.331 --> 00:49:12.240
<v Speaker 3>division,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just the Marine Corps,</v>

985
00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.150
<v Speaker 3>the same division.</v>

986
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:18.580
<v Speaker 3>And that division has a motto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no better friend,</v>

987
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:22.090
<v Speaker 3>no worse enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's America first.</v>

988
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:27.550
<v Speaker 3>So when you see someone like John Bolton</v>
<v Speaker 3>a now part of the cabinet,</v>

989
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.680
<v Speaker 3>and if you were to look on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

990
00:49:29.681 --> 00:49:31.360
<v Speaker 3>not that you can get truth out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>

991
00:49:31.361 --> 00:49:33.520
<v Speaker 3>but the day it was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

992
00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:34.563
<v Speaker 3>everybody's saying this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start world war three and just the </v>

993
00:49:36.701 --> 00:49:37.534
<v Speaker 3>general hysterics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now John Bolton is definitely </v>

994
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:42.680
<v Speaker 3>suspect more of a neocon than you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable with it.</v>

995
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.553
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's fair to Chordoma </v>

996
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Naoko.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

997
00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's ideologically driven.</v>

998
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:53.050
<v Speaker 3>If you watch the videos that he know </v>
<v Speaker 3>recording of his speech is 20 years ago,</v>

999
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.260
<v Speaker 3>he was certainly very much like trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're America and we have interests.</v>

1000
00:49:56.261 --> 00:49:57.200
<v Speaker 3>You want to work with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1001
00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.570
<v Speaker 3>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a problem.</v>

1002
00:49:58.571 --> 00:49:59.400
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1003
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.233
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's very telling that </v>
<v Speaker 3>within 40 minutes of the president's </v>

1004
00:50:02.351 --> 00:50:05.500
<v Speaker 3>tweet about John Coming on board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1005
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.393
<v Speaker 3>massive bulk and gave an interview on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox and they asked him about what are </v>

1006
00:50:10.061 --> 00:50:11.690
<v Speaker 3>you going to be like as a national </v>
<v Speaker 3>security advisor?</v>

1007
00:50:11.691 --> 00:50:16.390
<v Speaker 3>And he gave a very interesting onset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could've Dean Acheson and you know,</v>

1008
00:50:16.391 --> 00:50:16.741
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1009
00:50:16.741 --> 00:50:20.370
<v Speaker 3>the doyen of foreign policy in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1010
00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.213
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this is true story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but John said the natural one was once </v>

1011
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.380
<v Speaker 3>asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you have such a good relationship</v>

1012
00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:27.650
<v Speaker 3>with the president in serve</v>

1013
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Indian actress and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1014
00:50:30.411 --> 00:50:34.430
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We may disagree on policy issues,</v>

1015
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.960
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never forget who was elected president</v>

1016
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:42.770
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a John Bolton two point.</v>

1017
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:43.604
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he understands that unlike his </v>

1018
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:45.554
<v Speaker 2>predecessor hr mcmaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not there to lecture the president </v>

1019
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 2>or forced his version of what you should</v>
<v Speaker 2>do onto the commodity and chief.</v>

1020
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:54.343
<v Speaker 2>He's at to be an honest broker and </v>
<v Speaker 2>provide a palate of options because </v>

1021
00:50:56.931 --> 00:51:00.230
<v Speaker 2>guess who gets to decide the person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was elected president.</v>

1022
00:51:00.231 --> 00:51:02.710
<v Speaker 2>So I'm very excited about John and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1023
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:03.853
<v Speaker 2>I'm as excited about Mike pompeo coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the CIA to the State Department </v>

1024
00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.920
<v Speaker 2>that we are in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good hands,</v>

1025
00:51:09.921 --> 00:51:11.570
<v Speaker 2>David.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you make sure,</v>

1026
00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:14.160
<v Speaker 2>if it's between the pure isolationists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1027
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.020
<v Speaker 2>and the neocons or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like the nation builder,</v>

1028
00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:20.780
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you make sure that not everything</v>

1029
00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:24.740
<v Speaker 2>that you do outside of our borders </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes something much bigger?</v>

1030
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1031
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:29.010
<v Speaker 2>we're still at war in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone knows why.</v>

1032
00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you,</v>

1033
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.820
<v Speaker 2>can you tell me why we're at war in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan?</v>

1034
00:51:31.821 --> 00:51:32.654
<v Speaker 2>Can anyone tell me why we went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why we went to Afghanistan in October </v>

1035
00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:38.211
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1036
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:40.640
<v Speaker 2>one is the only reason we should be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1037
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1038
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:44.720
<v Speaker 2>The idea that goes go to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1039
00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:45.613
<v Speaker 2>I get it that people can listen to music</v>
<v Speaker 2>freely and the Taliban won't execute </v>

1040
00:51:48.321 --> 00:51:50.600
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents lived on the communism.</v>

1041
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:51.493
<v Speaker 2>My father suffered under fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He protected his fellow Jewish </v>

1042
00:51:54.441 --> 00:51:56.600
<v Speaker 2>classmates during the occupation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Budapest.</v>

1043
00:51:56.601 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like those kinds of systems,</v>

1044
00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.373
<v Speaker 2>but there's only one reason why they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were there to make sure that that piece </v>

1045
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:07.661
<v Speaker 2>of land that would never ever again be </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to execute mass casualty attacks in</v>

1046
00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:09.224
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Washington or in a field in </v>

1047
00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:12.134
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania.</v>

1048
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:13.183
<v Speaker 2>End of story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about building a ring road </v>

1049
00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:17.180
<v Speaker 2>around Kabul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The not even the Soviets could finish.</v>

1050
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not about building hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry you never make the ideal,</v>

1051
00:52:20.811 --> 00:52:21.644
<v Speaker 2>the enemy of the good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the president does is he looks at </v>

1052
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:25.124
<v Speaker 2>things as questions of possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot be a massively successful </v>

1053
00:52:30.291 --> 00:52:33.020
<v Speaker 2>realtor in the toughest market in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1054
00:52:33.021 --> 00:52:33.854
<v Speaker 2>which is New York real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a filter that distorts </v>

1055
00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:37.934
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean either this square footage is </v>

1056
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:40.514
<v Speaker 2>worth x or it's not worth x according to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the market and that's how he approaches </v>

1057
00:52:44.811 --> 00:52:47.690
<v Speaker 2>these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Afghanistan is only important to make</v>

1058
00:52:47.691 --> 00:52:51.180
<v Speaker 2>sure that bad guys don't use it again to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill Americans in America.</v>

1059
00:52:51.181 --> 00:52:52.580
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would say,</v>

1060
00:52:52.581 --> 00:52:56.060
<v Speaker 2>or at least if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had to guesstimate basically what</v>

1061
00:52:56.061 --> 00:52:56.894
<v Speaker 2>he believes you would say that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes that still keeping us there at </v>

1062
00:52:59.451 --> 00:53:01.490
<v Speaker 2>the moment is still accomplishing.</v>

1063
00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.573
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to get somebody tell you </v>

1064
00:53:03.021 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:07.660
<v Speaker 2>So you believe that as well because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just seems unclear and it has nothing to</v>

1066
00:53:07.661 --> 00:53:08.600
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will.</v>

1067
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:11.170
<v Speaker 2>He will never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to write this 71 year old man who</v>

1068
00:53:11.171 --> 00:53:12.470
<v Speaker 2>is now the most powerful man in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1069
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.210
<v Speaker 2>will never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

1070
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:19.510
<v Speaker 2>ever buy into a nation building scenario</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere outside of the United States.</v>

1071
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:21.703
<v Speaker 2>Not happening for the next seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>End of story and the idea that you have </v>

1072
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 2>my followers on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tearing their hair out,</v>

1073
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.083
<v Speaker 2>the boltons going to invade Syria guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a grip on reality and stop talking </v>

1074
00:53:37.111 --> 00:53:40.560
<v Speaker 2>about crisis actors and 10 fall how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>garbage.</v>

1075
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:43.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not gonna happen while the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president's the president.</v>

1076
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.213
<v Speaker 2>Well that I tweeted something to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect the day of the Bolton thing </v>

1077
00:53:46.321 --> 00:53:47.154
<v Speaker 2>because it also reminds me that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand basic deterrence that </v>

1078
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.420
<v Speaker 2>you have to bring in people that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1079
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:54.390
<v Speaker 2>talk a big game.</v>

1080
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.580
<v Speaker 2>So that pronounced to arrange these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

1081
00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man who was going to take us to war,</v>

1082
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 2>what did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the success in North Korea today</v>

1083
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.953
<v Speaker 2>has in large part been been a thanks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>his tweets because that's how you deal </v>

1084
00:54:09.151 --> 00:54:11.580
<v Speaker 2>with dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make fun of them.</v>

1085
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.440
<v Speaker 2>They hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you were ridiculed him.</v>

1086
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you do what you scare them.</v>

1087
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lo and behold,</v>

1088
00:54:19.531 --> 00:54:22.380
<v Speaker 2>they want to negotiate for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time in 65 years.</v>

1089
00:54:22.381 --> 00:54:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that interesting?</v>

1090
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's any chance he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever give up his nukes?</v>

1091
00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:31.170
<v Speaker 2>About three percent because at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

1092
00:54:31.171 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Speaker 2>what leverage does he have left?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1093
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:33.683
<v Speaker 2>So that you still think it's worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>having the talks to figure out what we </v>

1094
00:54:36.631 --> 00:54:37.351
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1095
00:54:37.351 --> 00:54:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Because what's happened for the last 25 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>

1096
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Escalation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>escalation,</v>

1097
00:54:40.801 --> 00:54:41.634
<v Speaker 2>escalation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

1098
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.580
<v Speaker 2>we have given into nuclear blackmail </v>
<v Speaker 2>since Bill Clinton.</v>

1099
00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1100
00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:49.830
<v Speaker 2>we have to at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to remember 1953 was not a peace</v>

1101
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:54.080
<v Speaker 2>treaty in 1953 in Korea was a ceasefire </v>
<v Speaker 2>and an armistice and that,</v>

1102
00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:57.780
<v Speaker 2>that is actually a wall that's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>simply been frozen for 65 years.</v>

1103
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Will be nice to have a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>peace treaty or something.</v>

1104
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:01.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of what's happening in the </v>

1105
00:55:03.961 --> 00:55:06.480
<v Speaker 2>world right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>

1106
00:55:06.481 --> 00:55:09.300
<v Speaker 2>You must be thrilled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume with everything going on at the</v>

1107
00:55:09.301 --> 00:55:12.720
<v Speaker 2>UN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nikki Haley as basically walked in there</v>

1108
00:55:12.721 --> 00:55:14.570
<v Speaker 2>and John Bolton two point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1109
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1110
00:55:15.241 --> 00:55:17.960
<v Speaker 2>she strikes me as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost wondered,</v>

1111
00:55:17.961 --> 00:55:19.920
<v Speaker 2>did trump really know what he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting with?</v>

1112
00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Ideally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:22.440
<v Speaker 2>Did anyone know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody did?</v>

1114
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:23.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1115
00:55:23.211 --> 00:55:24.540
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know her at all?</v>

1116
00:55:24.541 --> 00:55:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of.</v>

1117
00:55:25.671 --> 00:55:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know her as a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1118
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:29.610
<v Speaker 2>she found herself.</v>

1119
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.940
<v Speaker 2>She found herself in more power to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1120
00:55:32.941 --> 00:55:35.040
<v Speaker 2>what usefulness do you see in the UN at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point?</v>

1121
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems like truly it seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the most corrupt should be backward</v>

1122
00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:41.310
<v Speaker 2>pushed into the river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really,</v>

1123
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.173
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the buildings basically other now </v>

1124
00:55:46.771 --> 00:55:48.120
<v Speaker 2>they're going to quote that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

1125
00:55:48.121 --> 00:55:51.600
<v Speaker 2>he was calling for him to be knocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1126
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:57.040
<v Speaker 2>the idea was a good idea in 1945 in San </v>
<v Speaker 2>Francisco,</v>

1127
00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:02.700
<v Speaker 2>let's have an organization that stops us</v>
<v Speaker 2>from killing 60 million people again.</v>

1128
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:05.123
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you look in dictatorships like </v>

1129
00:56:08.551 --> 00:56:09.384
<v Speaker 2>China and Russia into the Security </v>
<v Speaker 2>Council with veto power and then you </v>

1130
00:56:13.921 --> 00:56:18.480
<v Speaker 2>create this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this empire of UN organizations,</v>

1131
00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:19.613
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has that been a year in the last 20 </v>

1132
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:23.560
<v Speaker 2>years that we haven't seen a UN scandal?</v>

1133
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.813
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's money for oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's UN troops raping children </v>

1134
00:56:28.421 --> 00:56:29.254
<v Speaker 3>in Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have we seen it one year without a UN </v>

1135
00:56:30.851 --> 00:56:33.070
<v Speaker 3>scandal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1136
00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:37.520
<v Speaker 3>So try and reform it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you come with a question,</v>

1137
00:56:37.521 --> 00:56:39.430
<v Speaker 3>the validity of what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget.</v>

1138
00:56:39.431 --> 00:56:40.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1139
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:40.751
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1140
00:56:40.751 --> 00:56:41.584
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the children's rights organizations and </v>

1141
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.130
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>food security.</v>

1142
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about its main mission which</v>
<v Speaker 3>is stability and safety.</v>

1143
00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:49.870
<v Speaker 3>Failed abysmally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:50.793
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you make of the endless </v>

1145
00:56:51.411 --> 00:56:52.244
<v Speaker 4>obsession with Israel that something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like 47 of the last 51 resolutions are </v>

1146
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:59.330
<v Speaker 4>against Israel and usually voted on by </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries.</v>

1147
00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:00.483
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that alone is a reason to dissolve </v>

1148
00:57:01.571 --> 00:57:04.990
<v Speaker 3>the UN mean what a lack of moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>compass.</v>

1149
00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:10.620
<v Speaker 3>What an utter bankruptcy of the morality</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are nations in the world that</v>

1150
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:12.783
<v Speaker 3>actually still have slavery going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slavery where we're basic human rights </v>

1151
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:23.850
<v Speaker 3>for individuals are not guaranteed based</v>
<v Speaker 3>upon sex based upon lifestyle choices.</v>

1152
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:30.970
<v Speaker 3>And you're going to lambast Israel the </v>
<v Speaker 3>only democracy in the Middle East.</v>

1153
00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:32.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1154
00:57:32.931 --> 00:57:34.140
<v Speaker 3>I think you nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

1155
00:57:34.141 --> 00:57:39.141
<v Speaker 3>that in and of itself is a reason enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>to question the future of the UN.</v>

1156
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:43.880
<v Speaker 4>So is the US sort of in an odd position </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's like if we don't do anything,</v>

1157
00:57:43.881 --> 00:57:45.980
<v Speaker 4>nothing can get done sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>

1158
00:57:45.981 --> 00:57:50.360
<v Speaker 4>that then puts us endlessly in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>quagmires or at least in these positions</v>

1159
00:57:50.361 --> 00:57:51.194
<v Speaker 4>where we can either watch the world burn</v>
<v Speaker 4>or get involved in things where we may </v>

1160
00:57:54.411 --> 00:57:56.540
<v Speaker 4>end up adding to the burning in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first place.</v>

1161
00:57:56.541 --> 00:57:58.090
<v Speaker 4>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1162
00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.110
<v Speaker 4>with Russia going into Crimea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1163
00:58:00.111 --> 00:58:01.940
<v Speaker 4>they gave up their weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1164
00:58:01.941 --> 00:58:03.220
<v Speaker 4>They gave up the weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said alright,</v>

1165
00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:06.920
<v Speaker 4>NATO is going to take care of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what that really means is the United</v>

1166
00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.753
<v Speaker 4>States is going to take care of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying we should have gone </v>

1167
00:58:09.531 --> 00:58:13.520
<v Speaker 4>in and done anything there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that we're in this endless situation</v>

1168
00:58:13.521 --> 00:58:17.450
<v Speaker 4>now where it is either us there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no international fighting.</v>

1169
00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:18.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're super careful not to get caught </v>

1170
00:58:20.901 --> 00:58:21.734
<v Speaker 3>in a binary dichotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can absolutely say a world without </v>

1171
00:58:26.991 --> 00:58:27.824
<v Speaker 3>American leadership is a more dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>world because it was for the last eight </v>

1172
00:58:30.651 --> 00:58:31.484
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1173
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean we had a government that actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>said we're going to lead from behind,</v>

1174
00:58:34.761 --> 00:58:37.220
<v Speaker 3>which is an oxymoron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot lead from behind.</v>

1175
00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.413
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have strategic patients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means we do nothing and allow </v>

1176
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:43.910
<v Speaker 3>others to act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

1177
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:49.600
<v Speaker 3>You name it from China building fate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ministry basis on fake islands to isis,</v>

1178
00:58:49.611 --> 00:58:52.460
<v Speaker 3>to Russia invading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a disaster.</v>

1179
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.990
<v Speaker 4>We back the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other guys and Rebecca.</v>

1180
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.333
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that a world without American </v>

1181
00:58:58.981 --> 00:59:01.100
<v Speaker 3>leadership is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is more dangerous,</v>

1182
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:02.563
<v Speaker 3>is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that we have to </v>

1183
00:59:04.161 --> 00:59:09.161
<v Speaker 3>fix everybody's problem and that's where</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart strategy comes in where you say,</v>

1184
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:14.990
<v Speaker 3>but we have a moral duty to espouse </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain values,</v>

1185
00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:20.210
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean we are responsible</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all human beings because.</v>

1186
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Because American revolution says the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite,</v>

1187
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each nation is responsible,</v>

1188
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:29.060
<v Speaker 3>the citizens are responsible if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like your system,</v>

1189
00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:30.133
<v Speaker 3>do something about it because guess what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did against the most powerful empire </v>

1190
00:59:33.951 --> 00:59:35.540
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1191
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:36.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1192
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:37.453
<v Speaker 3>it's about finding that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happy medium in the middle and </v>

1193
00:59:39.651 --> 00:59:41.300
<v Speaker 3>being smart about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1194
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:45.290
<v Speaker 3>without being callous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being realistic,</v>

1195
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:46.503
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are atrocities everywhere from </v>

1196
00:59:47.871 --> 00:59:52.871
<v Speaker 3>Orlando to Yugoslavia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part American taxpayers going to pay for</v>

1197
00:59:53.121 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 3>fixing all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we responsible?</v>

1198
00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Are they responsible for what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening in their country?</v>

1199
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.720
<v Speaker 3>Sure are the times when we could perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 3>help them,</v>

1200
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's a balance to balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1201
01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:08.780
<v Speaker 3>so let's shift back to your book </v>
<v Speaker 3>defeating Jihad.</v>

1202
01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:09.643
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that the main sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative on this is not that we can </v>

1203
01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:15.820
<v Speaker 3>defeat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we should live with it,</v>

1204
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:19.100
<v Speaker 3>that there's a degree of it with which </v>
<v Speaker 3>we should just live,</v>

1205
01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:23.150
<v Speaker 3>which is don't carry knives in London </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1206
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:25.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to put up more barricades so</v>

1207
01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:26.234
<v Speaker 3>the trucks can't be driven into </v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings or into shopping centers or </v>

1208
01:00:28.881 --> 01:00:29.714
<v Speaker 3>just down the street and killing people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can't really defeat this </v>

1209
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:34.970
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just have to manage it.</v>

1210
01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:35.853
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect you do not agree with that </v>

1211
01:00:37.521 --> 01:00:40.040
<v Speaker 3>premise because we've defeated </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologies before.</v>

1212
01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.393
<v Speaker 3>You can't look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are idiots who run around with </v>

1213
01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:45.770
<v Speaker 3>swastika arm bands today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1214
01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:46.604
<v Speaker 3>So Nazi-ism hasn't disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have made it so anathema that if </v>

1215
01:00:50.871 --> 01:00:53.330
<v Speaker 3>you walk down the street with a Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 3>flag,</v>

1216
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:56.390
<v Speaker 3>you will be rejected by society </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantly.</v>

1217
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:58.490
<v Speaker 3>The same thing with the KKK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1218
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:59.743
<v Speaker 3>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not with Che Guevara was a hammer and </v>

1219
01:01:01.611 --> 01:01:02.271
<v Speaker 3>sickle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1220
01:01:02.271 --> 01:01:02.651
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1221
01:01:02.651 --> 01:01:03.484
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are ways to defeat ideologies </v>

1222
01:01:05.631 --> 01:01:10.400
<v Speaker 3>or to put them in a box where the La </v>
<v Speaker 3>football and everybody shuns them.</v>

1223
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:12.770
<v Speaker 3>We have to do the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>jihadism.</v>

1224
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.380
<v Speaker 3>This is my argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the conclusion of the book.</v>

1225
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 3>We have to be as effective in dealer </v>
<v Speaker 3>gentamycin.</v>

1226
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:21.230
<v Speaker 3>The message of Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because very simply put,</v>

1227
01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.110
<v Speaker 3>killing jihadis is great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the end of the day,</v>

1228
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.350
<v Speaker 3>a bodybags as a metric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a good metric.</v>

1229
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:30.380
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work in Vietnam doesn't work </v>
<v Speaker 3>today because guess what?</v>

1230
01:01:30.381 --> 01:01:32.180
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a recruiting pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's massive.</v>

1231
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Not just recruit new jihadis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what's your victory condition?</v>

1232
01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:36.374
<v Speaker 3>Your victory condition is when the life </v>
<v Speaker 3>style of jihad is no longer sexy from </v>

1233
01:01:41.721 --> 01:01:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Brussels to San Bernardino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you do that?</v>

1234
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:46.340
<v Speaker 3>You make a laughingstock.</v>

1235
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.293
<v Speaker 3>You discredit that value system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not asking white skin Catholic </v>

1236
01:01:52.131 --> 01:01:54.410
<v Speaker 3>isn't going to do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we help.</v>

1237
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:55.503
<v Speaker 3>President Sisi were helped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>King Abdullah of Jordan will help mbes </v>

1238
01:01:58.401 --> 01:02:00.310
<v Speaker 3>in Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean mbs,</v>

1239
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.480
<v Speaker 3>historic things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1240
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:05.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean massive about Israel in just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last few weeks.</v>

1241
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:08.870
<v Speaker 3>That's how we win because sooner or </v>
<v Speaker 3>later enough people say,</v>

1242
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.400
<v Speaker 3>those guys are losers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how we win,</v>

1243
01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.620
<v Speaker 3>but you only do that if you get to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1244
01:02:15.621 --> 01:02:16.454
<v Speaker 3>Truthfully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be able to talk about the </v>

1245
01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Koran or jihad means the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion because if you can't talk about</v>

1246
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:22.374
<v Speaker 3>it honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to treat it </v>

1247
01:02:22.771 --> 01:02:23.780
<v Speaker 3>accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1248
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.440
<v Speaker 3>We're not very good at that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1249
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.610
<v Speaker 3>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1250
01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:29.683
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine if you're a doctor and you've </v>

1251
01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:35.850
<v Speaker 3>got a patient that comes in with a third</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage lymphoma,</v>

1252
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:39.030
<v Speaker 3>but your hospital administrator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a scary word,</v>

1253
01:02:39.031 --> 01:02:40.800
<v Speaker 3>has banned the use of the word cancer.</v>

1254
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.710
<v Speaker 3>You can't say it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not allowed.</v>

1255
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:44.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to tell the patient </v>

1256
01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:46.470
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1257
01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:47.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dehydrated.</v>

1258
01:02:47.701 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Go home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink some water,</v>

1259
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:50.620
<v Speaker 3>and take some aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens to your patient?</v>

1260
01:02:50.621 --> 01:02:52.530
<v Speaker 3>And they die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>

1261
01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:55.830
<v Speaker 3>If you can't diagnose a geo strategical </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue accurately,</v>

1262
01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:59.490
<v Speaker 3>however much money you throw at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will not solve the problem.</v>

1263
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:00.623
<v Speaker 3>So are you concerned at all that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's purely because of the way </v>

1264
01:03:03.391 --> 01:03:04.224
<v Speaker 3>the media frames things that perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump is not the right person to lead </v>

1265
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 3>the fight against this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that for whatever,</v>

1266
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.233
<v Speaker 3>whatever he's going to say about Jihad </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a radical Islamic terrorism or the </v>

1267
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:18.870
<v Speaker 3>rest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if he said everything the exact way</v>

1268
01:03:18.871 --> 01:03:19.704
<v Speaker 3>that you wanted it to be sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cleanly and clearly and correctly </v>

1269
01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:23.424
<v Speaker 3>defined all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he may not be the right messenger </v>

1270
01:03:26.521 --> 01:03:30.330
<v Speaker 3>on this just because of the filter it </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to get through to get to reality.</v>

1271
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:31.463
<v Speaker 3>He's not the right messenger </v>
<v Speaker 3>domestically because of what political </v>

1272
01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:39.381
<v Speaker 3>correctness is wrought in our country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he is absolutely the right message.</v>

1273
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Internationally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch the video of his speech.</v>

1274
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.083
<v Speaker 3>Don't watch him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch the 53 mostly matter of heads of </v>

1275
01:03:47.911 --> 01:03:51.350
<v Speaker 3>state and the body language because man </v>
<v Speaker 3>did he say,</v>

1276
01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:52.403
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a problem in your most and your </v>

1277
01:03:53.761 --> 01:03:56.070
<v Speaker 3>society is extremely determined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to deal with it.</v>

1278
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:56.933
<v Speaker 3>It was tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A new thing that'd be all negative and </v>

1279
01:03:58.951 --> 01:04:01.740
<v Speaker 3>arms crossed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were beaming,</v>

1280
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:04.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cc Abdullah.</v>

1281
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 3>We're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1282
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.513
<v Speaker 3>finally a guy who understands our </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem and what is giving us tough </v>

1283
01:04:10.111 --> 01:04:11.190
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1284
01:04:11.191 --> 01:04:12.024
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is absolutely the right guy to fix </v>

1285
01:04:13.831 --> 01:04:14.664
<v Speaker 3>this internationally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is where it needs to be fixed </v>

1286
01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:16.943
<v Speaker 3>domestically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the political correctness thing is </v>

1287
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:21.750
<v Speaker 3>going to get in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The media insanity.</v>

1288
01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:22.913
<v Speaker 3>So do you think he has more support from</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign heads of state and then we'll </v>

1289
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.610
<v Speaker 3>have a sense.</v>

1290
01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:29.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean even at the Ga there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling of like that actually these guys</v>

1291
01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:33.020
<v Speaker 3>kinda liked him or I can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1292
01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 3>I told people before the inauguration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no idea.</v>

1293
01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:38.483
<v Speaker 3>Even if you voted for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no idea how successful he will </v>

1294
01:04:41.251 --> 01:04:42.084
<v Speaker 3>be internationally because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight shooter because he's an Alpha </v>

1295
01:04:47.881 --> 01:04:49.350
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And guess what?</v>

1296
01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:54.380
<v Speaker 3>In a lot of places outside of Berkeley </v>
<v Speaker 3>they like have that right?</v>

1297
01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Because they know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1298
01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:02.970
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to walk on eggshells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They understand your direction.</v>

1299
01:05:02.971 --> 01:05:07.050
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>internationally are prestige as a nation</v>

1300
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.330
<v Speaker 3>has skyrocketed in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1301
01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:15.210
<v Speaker 3>outside of the European Union and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain century pin countries exempted.</v>

1302
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1303
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we could do a whole</v>

1304
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.240
<v Speaker 2>other show on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1305
01:05:19.241 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 2>but very quickly just on Russia </v>
<v Speaker 2>collusion,</v>

1306
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 2>as someone that has been around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>

1307
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:25.900
<v Speaker 2>you've mentioned some of these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

1308
01:05:25.901 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 2>flint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1309
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:27.634
<v Speaker 2>down the road.</v>

1310
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.301
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1311
01:05:29.301 --> 01:05:30.134
<v Speaker 2>what can you tell me about that and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there anything that people should be </v>

1312
01:05:32.181 --> 01:05:35.240
<v Speaker 2>worried about or do you think this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>all going to actually point just back to</v>

1313
01:05:35.241 --> 01:05:36.680
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which every time it seems,</v>

1314
01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.633
<v Speaker 2>every time it seems to point to trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go a little bit further and then </v>

1315
01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:40.451
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1316
01:05:40.451 --> 01:05:41.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

1317
01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:44.350
<v Speaker 2>That was actually the Democrats do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My good friend has a,</v>

1318
01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.450
<v Speaker 2>the best morning show in DC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1319
01:05:46.451 --> 01:05:47.284
<v Speaker 2>I'm Chris plot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The radio host is actually a national </v>

1320
01:05:49.311 --> 01:05:51.560
<v Speaker 2>syndicated and I have to credit him with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1321
01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:52.403
<v Speaker 2>He says it's the last scene from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt for Red October when the bad </v>

1322
01:05:56.301 --> 01:05:57.134
<v Speaker 2>captain Tupolev launches the torpedoes </v>
<v Speaker 2>against Sean connery on the radio </v>

1323
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:04.880
<v Speaker 2>October.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it takes the fuses off and then what</v>

1324
01:06:04.881 --> 01:06:06.470
<v Speaker 2>happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember his ex says,</v>

1325
01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.213
<v Speaker 2>your thing comes back and syncs them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the most hilarious boomerang in </v>

1326
01:06:14.121 --> 01:06:14.954
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1327
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:17.060
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what the president told me</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Oval Office,</v>

1328
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:17.913
<v Speaker 3>it's just the two of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very frustrated one day I think </v>

1329
01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:22.840
<v Speaker 3>maybe dad had just testified or given </v>
<v Speaker 3>his speech,</v>

1330
01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:23.893
<v Speaker 3>his little press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said they will not find anything </v>

1331
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.330
<v Speaker 3>because there is nothing and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1332
01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:34.120
<v Speaker 3>I take that to the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no Russia collusion.</v>

1333
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.240
<v Speaker 3>How could there be off for the last 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>months from arming the Ukrainians to the</v>

1334
01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:44.950
<v Speaker 3>xl pipeline to Anwar to finally after 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1335
01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:45.784
<v Speaker 3>the first president to ever get NATO to </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally stump up the two percent of GDP </v>

1336
01:06:49.991 --> 01:06:50.824
<v Speaker 3>that they promised they'd spend on </v>
<v Speaker 3>defense to our own military expenditure </v>

1337
01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:54.574
<v Speaker 3>increases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every significant policy decision this </v>

1338
01:06:56.610 --> 01:06:57.443
<v Speaker 3>president has taken with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia has been bad for that former KGB </v>

1339
01:07:00.911 --> 01:07:03.700
<v Speaker 3>colonel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the idea that we're colluding,</v>

1340
01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.880
<v Speaker 3>you have to be on drugs or be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologically blind to believe that,</v>

1341
01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:13.460
<v Speaker 2>well then what do we do with this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This layer,</v>

1342
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that you.</v>

1343
01:07:14.661 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 2>You've referenced deep state before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1344
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1345
01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:21.950
<v Speaker 2>What do we do with this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we have an ongoing investigation?</v>

1346
01:07:21.951 --> 01:07:23.720
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mueller investigation,</v>

1347
01:07:23.721 --> 01:07:26.750
<v Speaker 2>which seems odd to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I don't know what the actual.</v>

1348
01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that they ever laid out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what their mission is other than to find</v>

1349
01:07:30.530 --> 01:07:31.363
<v Speaker 2>what was the crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and that illusion to commit to </v>

1350
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:37.850
<v Speaker 2>collusion to conspire in a crime.</v>

1351
01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's the crime?</v>

1352
01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.593
<v Speaker 3>Because if it's Russia misrepresenting </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself or perverting the truth on </v>

1353
01:07:47.061 --> 01:07:47.894
<v Speaker 3>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then Zuckerberg should be charged </v>

1354
01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:53.683
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you know Anderson Cooper should be </v>

1355
01:07:55.761 --> 01:07:56.594
<v Speaker 3>in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the charges that have been </v>

1356
01:07:59.841 --> 01:08:04.841
<v Speaker 3>brought outrageously ridiculous or lying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to federal investigators?</v>

1357
01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.033
<v Speaker 3>You?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would probably be able to be caught </v>

1358
01:08:09.321 --> 01:08:11.330
<v Speaker 3>in a perjury trap today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1359
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:13.910
<v Speaker 3>because not everybody remembers what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they did and how they did it.</v>

1360
01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:14.953
<v Speaker 3>Poetry traps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you said to somebody Irri </v>

1361
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:20.450
<v Speaker 3>irrespective of Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not donald trump's problem.</v>

1362
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 3>Why a fraud?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight years ago when manafort worked for</v>

1363
01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:26.474
<v Speaker 3>the Ukrainian president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that going to do with Russian </v>

1364
01:08:30.051 --> 01:08:30.890
<v Speaker 3>collusion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

1365
01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:34.760
<v Speaker 3>My worry is that Mueller is not a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>actor.</v>

1366
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:39.260
<v Speaker 3>If you look at who is hired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's clear that there's massive bias and</v>

1367
01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:44.261
<v Speaker 3>this report is writing for Congress is </v>
<v Speaker 3>simply going to be a political weapon in</v>

1368
01:08:45.021 --> 01:08:48.590
<v Speaker 3>the elections and and that's not how </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice is served.</v>

1369
01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.424
<v Speaker 3>That's the rule of law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a law enforcement official </v>

1370
01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:55.640
<v Speaker 3>getting involved in politics.</v>

1371
01:08:55.690 --> 01:08:57.310
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I'm concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

1372
01:08:57.311 --> 01:08:58.144
<v Speaker 4>whether,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you think something for the </v>

1373
01:08:59.561 --> 01:09:00.394
<v Speaker 4>people that are watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing something happened or didn't </v>

1374
01:09:01.451 --> 01:09:02.284
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm more concerned about is that </v>

1375
01:09:02.911 --> 01:09:03.744
<v Speaker 4>we're entering this new phase where </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's trump that's president or </v>

1376
01:09:06.581 --> 01:09:09.220
<v Speaker 4>it's a Democrat that's president or it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a different republican or whatever,</v>

1377
01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.293
<v Speaker 4>that we're just going to endlessly also </v>
<v Speaker 4>have this layer that all it does is </v>

1378
01:09:13.181 --> 01:09:15.130
<v Speaker 4>investigate itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Waste money,</v>

1379
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.313
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just constantly just be keeping us all </v>

1380
01:09:17.951 --> 01:09:20.350
<v Speaker 4>in this state where we never know what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

1381
01:09:20.351 --> 01:09:24.010
<v Speaker 4>Because if you listen to half of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pundits on television,</v>

1382
01:09:24.011 --> 01:09:28.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean their implication is that Russia </v>
<v Speaker 4>has installed our president,</v>

1383
01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.164
<v Speaker 4>in which case that's probably the single</v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest active board and the history of </v>

1384
01:09:31.871 --> 01:09:33.910
<v Speaker 4>the world and what are you actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying?</v>

1385
01:09:33.911 --> 01:09:34.744
<v Speaker 4>Do we take trump out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then do you take out pence and now </v>

1386
01:09:36.491 --> 01:09:37.440
<v Speaker 4>should Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1387
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.293
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you take it to its logical </v>
<v Speaker 4>conclusion or do we have Paul Ryan as </v>

1388
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:44.320
<v Speaker 4>president then and right where are you </v>
<v Speaker 4>really taking this?</v>

1389
01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.213
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I'm worried about is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're just going to end up in this </v>

1390
01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:48.543
<v Speaker 4>constant state where yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll have a democrat and a Republican </v>

1391
01:09:50.471 --> 01:09:53.180
<v Speaker 4>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we'll really be caught in just con.</v>

1392
01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.320
<v Speaker 4>All government can do is investigate </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself be more than anything else.</v>

1393
01:09:57.970 --> 01:09:59.790
<v Speaker 3>I see myself as an optimist,</v>

1394
01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:02.280
<v Speaker 4>but you're giving me a real challenge </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that last one.</v>

1395
01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:05.740
<v Speaker 4>I see myself as an optimist too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I'm a realist.</v>

1396
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:09.270
<v Speaker 4>So for months and months and months or </v>
<v Speaker 4>refused to use the phrase deep state,</v>

1397
01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:11.850
<v Speaker 4>I really thought that was a tinfoil hat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He kind of thing.</v>

1398
01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:14.430
<v Speaker 4>One of the record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know that I've even said it</v>

1399
01:10:14.431 --> 01:10:17.070
<v Speaker 4>once on this show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sort of pops up and answers.</v>

1400
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.810
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

1401
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:22.810
<v Speaker 3>use it now because I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it inside the administration.</v>

1402
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:27.620
<v Speaker 3>When you go to enough National Security </v>
<v Speaker 3>Council meetings that are classified,</v>

1403
01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.220
<v Speaker 3>that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1404
01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:31.083
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pinnacle of policymaking in America </v>

1405
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.290
<v Speaker 3>outside of the Oval Office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where policy's made.</v>

1406
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.393
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's in the room from the NSC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you've got the outstations on </v>

1407
01:10:39.651 --> 01:10:43.760
<v Speaker 3>secure vtc from Dia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a chair of the joint chiefs,</v>

1408
01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:45.410
<v Speaker 3>CIA state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you name it,</v>

1409
01:10:45.411 --> 01:10:47.750
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you sit there as a new deployment of</v>

1410
01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:51.170
<v Speaker 3>political and you listen for two hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a big issue,</v>

1411
01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.490
<v Speaker 3>isis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

1412
01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:53.324
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not one participant mentions the </v>

1413
01:10:57.321 --> 01:10:58.154
<v Speaker 3>name of the president or what he said </v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday in Warsaw or what his </v>

1414
01:11:04.221 --> 01:11:05.054
<v Speaker 3>objective is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given that specific issue and you see </v>

1415
01:11:07.881 --> 01:11:08.714
<v Speaker 3>this happen again and again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're the guy at the end of the </v>

1416
01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.230
<v Speaker 3>conversation with the funny accent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

1417
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:13.560
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1418
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 3>you do</v>

1419
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.260
<v Speaker 2>know what the president said about x </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday.</v>

1420
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Can we actually do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The deep state is real.</v>

1421
01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:24.710
<v Speaker 2>When you've got gas fifteens and scs is </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1422
01:11:24.711 --> 01:11:26.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been here for 20 years.</v>

1423
01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I know this guy is going to be here for </v>
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

1424
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I know better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bad for democracy.</v>

1425
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:32.274
<v Speaker 2>So it'll be clear that you don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's some sort of massive underground </v>

1426
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:37.440
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think it's just the apparatus,</v>

1427
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:38.423
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the old Washington apparatus </v>

1428
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:40.584
<v Speaker 2>so that I don't think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people who think Obama sitting in </v>

1429
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:45.770
<v Speaker 2>a cave somewhere with a joystick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's lazy.</v>

1430
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:49.700
<v Speaker 2>He'd never be a Muslim was I'll specter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not blofeld but,</v>

1431
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:50.833
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a culture in government that's </v>

1432
01:11:52.951 --> 01:11:53.784
<v Speaker 2>antithetical to an undermining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undermining the president on a daily </v>

1433
01:11:57.211 --> 01:11:59.100
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1434
01:11:59.101 --> 01:12:01.470
<v Speaker 2>but there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is concerted effort in the media.</v>

1435
01:12:01.471 --> 01:12:02.304
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1436
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Ben Rhodes brags about Ai.</v>

1437
01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.510
<v Speaker 2>That guy's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he says.</v>

1438
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.350
<v Speaker 2>My bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left wing journalists are morons and</v>

1439
01:12:10.351 --> 01:12:12.720
<v Speaker 2>they're my echo chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1440
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:13.673
<v Speaker 2>he built this machine that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this incestuous connection between </v>

1441
01:12:18.241 --> 01:12:19.074
<v Speaker 2>people in the West Wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the think tank community and </v>

1442
01:12:21.121 --> 01:12:23.010
<v Speaker 2>their buddies in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1443
01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.530
<v Speaker 2>look at the attack pieces on anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me or whatever.</v>

1444
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:27.780
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody should do a case study.</v>

1445
01:12:27.781 --> 01:12:30.960
<v Speaker 2>A journalism school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one attack piece will drop at 7:00</v>

1446
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 2>AM by 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon,</v>

1447
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:36.060
<v Speaker 2>30 have been written.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just simply cut and paste.</v>

1448
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:37.890
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks as,</v>

1449
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.230
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gawkers a fascist.</v>

1450
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:41.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one guy's article.</v>

1451
01:12:41.731 --> 01:12:44.010
<v Speaker 2>It was written because Ben Rhodes told </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to ride it.</v>

1452
01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:48.480
<v Speaker 2>That comes and multiplies on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we react?</v>

1453
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my ipad international review.</v>

1454
01:12:52.441 --> 01:12:53.274
<v Speaker 2>This one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a Gulf in terms of managing </v>

1455
01:13:00.901 --> 01:13:01.800
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>

1456
01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:03.043
<v Speaker 2>The left built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>built a whole ecosystem and we're still </v>

1457
01:13:06.421 --> 01:13:07.380
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1458
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:08.303
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll take out a full page ad in the </v>

1459
01:13:09.091 --> 01:13:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why when discussing,</v>

1460
01:13:12.061 --> 01:13:13.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1461
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's so important to not odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people,</v>

1462
01:13:15.931 --> 01:13:17.820
<v Speaker 2>especially just because of the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media works,</v>

1463
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:21.600
<v Speaker 2>they immediately go to the full on </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy of Obama with the joystick or</v>

1464
01:13:21.601 --> 01:13:23.070
<v Speaker 2>just some other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1465
01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:26.830
<v Speaker 2>the globalist thing and this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's like they're there.</v>

1466
01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:27.893
<v Speaker 2>What you just described seems more </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic to me that there's an </v>

1467
01:13:29.851 --> 01:13:30.684
<v Speaker 2>apparatus there that then is still </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to the media that seems we </v>

1468
01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:36.744
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can discuss that in a sensible way </v>

1469
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:39.910
<v Speaker 2>with one audition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1470
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:43.470
<v Speaker 2>and I appreciate this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not having been,</v>

1471
01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:44.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the target has the crosshairs for so </v>

1472
01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:47.214
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have an advantage because our site </v>

1473
01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:56.730
<v Speaker 2>is predicated on what David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual manifest destiny,</v>

1474
01:13:56.731 --> 01:13:57.750
<v Speaker 2>the rugged individualism.</v>

1475
01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:00.510
<v Speaker 2>We believe in individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left by definition,</v>

1476
01:14:00.511 --> 01:14:01.344
<v Speaker 2>as a collective entity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are elements of the Borg in the </v>

1477
01:14:04.981 --> 01:14:09.981
<v Speaker 2>left and it is a truly is a collective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collective mob mentality.</v>

1478
01:14:10.441 --> 01:14:12.640
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine on Raphael Watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1479
01:14:12.641 --> 01:14:14.180
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is smoke.</v>

1480
01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:15.203
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1481
01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:18.040
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when one guy goes off the goal Golkar or</v>

1482
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.903
<v Speaker 2>Bannon or whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president that has this massive </v>

1483
01:14:21.101 --> 01:14:23.740
<v Speaker 2>collective pylon sort of conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

1484
01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:26.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all on the same hymn sheet.</v>

1485
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:29.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't need direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they say,</v>

1486
01:14:29.321 --> 01:14:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go off to him.</v>

1487
