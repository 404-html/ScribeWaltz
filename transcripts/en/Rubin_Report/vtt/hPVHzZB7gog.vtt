1
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.963
<v Speaker 1>The question I get asked more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else lately is how can you </v>

2
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>possibly say that revenge of the Sith </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a good movie,</v>

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>but after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do have my reasons,</v>

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>the next most asked question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do you trust in the media?</v>

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding this question harder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder to answer these days,</v>

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.064
<v Speaker 1>which is yet another indication of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>screwed up our political and social </v>

7
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>system is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

8
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:27.144
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to know just how screwy our </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is or whether it's just the </v>

9
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:31.614
<v Speaker 1>loudest and craziest voices that </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently get amplified on social </v>

10
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:35.604
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the American revolution actually </v>

11
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>was a bit nuttier than the history books</v>
<v Speaker 1>would tell us,</v>

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.153
<v Speaker 1>but we'll never know because George </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington didn't have the chance to </v>

13
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.334
<v Speaker 1>live tweeted without trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really don't have the basic </v>

14
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>underpinnings for a free and pluralistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

15
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.373
<v Speaker 1>We have to trust our elected officials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will do the jobs they're sworn in to do </v>

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>and carry out the promises they said </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would deliver upon.</v>

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.713
<v Speaker 1>We have to trust that our media will </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the political elite in check and </v>

18
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.004
<v Speaker 1>not just suck up to the powers that be </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have to trust that our </v>

19
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.294
<v Speaker 1>institutions are strong enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>withstand corrupt politicians and </v>

20
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:17.850
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian ideologies that would strip</v>
<v Speaker 1>us from the very freedoms our system was</v>

21
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>built upon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

22
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:20.604
<v Speaker 1>trust without doing the necessary work </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure it's based in logic and </v>

23
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:25.854
<v Speaker 1>reason is really just faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having faith that our politicians will </v>

24
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:30.894
<v Speaker 1>do the right thing or that our media </v>
<v Speaker 1>will hold the politicians to account or </v>

25
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:35.424
<v Speaker 1>that our system will just function as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>should is basically a recipe for </v>

26
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely,</v>

27
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:42.354
<v Speaker 1>our freedoms will be chipped away at </v>
<v Speaker 1>because faith isn't what guarantees our </v>

28
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>freedoms in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the constitution that does so.</v>

29
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.113
<v Speaker 1>Trust is built over time by repeated </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that you can actually believe </v>

30
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>that when someone says something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what they mean.</v>

31
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe it's simply because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say it.</v>

32
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:01.524
<v Speaker 1>You believe it because of a track record</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a person consistently following </v>

33
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>through on their word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the opposite of faith,</v>

34
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>which is built on the idea of believing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in something without evidence.</v>

35
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.193
<v Speaker 1>We usually talk about these existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues in the context of God and </v>

36
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.124
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it would serve us all well </v>

37
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>to ask some important questions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these issues right here and right now.</v>

38
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>So now let me kick the question back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

39
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.503
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you trust in the media?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing it's a pretty short list </v>

40
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got some good names,</v>

41
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:34.014
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to hear them in the comment </v>
<v Speaker 1>section right down below and let's go a </v>

42
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>step further with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you trust in politics?</v>

43
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>If you're the biggest trump supporter </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>

44
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:42.954
<v Speaker 1>do you truly trust everything that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says or do you accept his untruths </v>

45
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>because you believe in his wider agenda.</v>

46
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.113
<v Speaker 1>Accepting the certain amount of untruth </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be the only legitimate way to view </v>

47
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 1>politics and politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you add a distrust of the media</v>

48
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.590
<v Speaker 1>to a of politicians and then toss in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy dose of social media craziness,</v>

49
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.803
<v Speaker 1>we ended up with this confused </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation in which we can't even </v>

50
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:08.704
<v Speaker 1>agree on basic facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This spot where nothing is really true </v>

51
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.743
<v Speaker 1>and what we feel overrides what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>provable is fertile ground for those on </v>

52
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>the extremes to take root.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who do I trust?</v>

53
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:21.154
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a wide range of people from Sam </v>

54
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Harris to Ben Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Larry Elder,</v>

55
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:25.564
<v Speaker 1>to Eric Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trusting these people doesn't mean that </v>

56
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>they're infallible or that I agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that they say,</v>

57
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.613
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean that I see they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment to the truth and they've </v>

58
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>consistently done their best to put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

59
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>They don't have all the answers and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly don't either,</v>

60
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're doing our best to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>some truth in the sea of craziness.</v>

61
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.163
<v Speaker 1>For those of us who genuinely want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to combat the forces who </v>

62
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>want to burn down the system or give </v>
<v Speaker 1>into authoritarian tyranny.</v>

63
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Our work is cut out for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As for me,</v>

64
00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:58.384
<v Speaker 1>I trust that it'll work out because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see more and more of you speaking out </v>

65
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:02.554
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might just say that a little faith </v>

66
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>in yourself goes a long way.</v>

67
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.333
<v Speaker 2>Joining me this week is a former </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate for president of the United </v>

68
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 2>States from the Libertarian Party and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man who,</v>

69
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:18.214
<v Speaker 2>according to his twitter bio is pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberty pro life and Pro Constitution </v>

70
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Austin Petersen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

71
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.473
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks for having me.</v>

72
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 2>We've been trying to do this for quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>some time.</v>

73
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Our twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to go bonkers.</v>

74
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.740
<v Speaker 2>My people love your pupil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're like me yet,</v>

75
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 2>but I guess the kind of remains to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

76
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I think they were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've noticed,</v>

77
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 2>but there seems to be a classical </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>

78
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 2>libertarian little bonding thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in America right now.</v>

79
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:43.774
<v Speaker 2>People said that if I get you to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a smaller libertarian than that </v>

80
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 2>they're going to donate five bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Super Pac.</v>

81
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.750
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

82
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are you a libertarian?</v>

83
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 2>We can where you can turn some of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>on me at some point,</v>

84
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.710
<v Speaker 2>but not right now yet.</v>

85
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just yet.</v>

86
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.591
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

87
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:57.424
<v Speaker 2>so it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shooting three shows today and I just </v>

88
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 2>walked outside with my dog just to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some fresh air.</v>

89
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I just found you wandering in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

90
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.250
<v Speaker 2>you didn't even take a car here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

91
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 2>you're truly a man of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:07.391
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 2>from Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up on a farm.</v>

94
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Pretty common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that um,</v>

96
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California is beautiful and uh,</v>

97
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to like be environmentalist</v>

98
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:17.614
<v Speaker 2>riding bicycles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just want to walk and found your </v>

99
00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:20.621
<v Speaker 2>studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here we are.</v>

101
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot I want to get to with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just start with the basics.</v>

102
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 2>People know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like definitions.</v>

103
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.053
<v Speaker 2>You ran as a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is a libertarian to you will </v>

104
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.503
<v Speaker 2>essentially libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It allows you to choose your own values </v>

105
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.673
<v Speaker 2>as long as you don't try and use the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government to force those values on </v>

106
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:39.994
<v Speaker 2>somebody else.</v>

107
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 2>That's why we get a lot of infighting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Libertarian party because we have so</v>

108
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 2>many people from so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds with different values.</v>

109
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.463
<v Speaker 2>But the one value we all share is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we believe that government should be </v>

110
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:53.750
<v Speaker 2>limited so that individuals can choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they want to do and,</v>

111
00:05:53.751 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 2>and choose their values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

112
00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 2>and explore the wide range of options,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.550
<v Speaker 2>sometimes those options are dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.463
<v Speaker 2>some people choose to smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they should have the right to do </v>

115
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 2>that as long as they don't try and </v>
<v Speaker 2>impose a cost on others.</v>

116
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

117
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.433
<v Speaker 2>and so as soon as you start talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what sort of cost people are </v>

118
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:11.444
<v Speaker 2>imposing on others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when government starts to come </v>

119
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 2>into the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

120
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 2>at the most hardcore end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism,</v>

121
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 2>which some say a is the true </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism is it's anarchy.</v>

122
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 2>And our coo capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I fall right before that.</v>

123
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.660
<v Speaker 2>I train right there and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call myself a min,</v>

124
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.503
<v Speaker 2>darkest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially the government should be </v>

125
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 2>relegated very basic rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should protect life,</v>

126
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 2>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the pursuit of happiness.</v>

127
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.233
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that may include things like fire </v>

128
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:39.021
<v Speaker 2>courts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>police,</v>

129
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise the,</v>

130
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 2>everything else should be solved by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

131
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had a Brian Caplan from George </v>

132
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Mason University who's in an narco </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital verlander co,</v>

133
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.460
<v Speaker 2>capital Arco for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

134
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant guy and I thoroughly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did about an hour and a half.</v>

135
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed every minute of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were moments where I thought,</v>

136
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.573
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a bit much know some private </v>

137
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 2>court stuff and some of the passivism </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and open borders,</v>

138
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 2>but is that the inherent problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Libertarian Party?</v>

139
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.503
<v Speaker 2>Not The philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the party that this thing is really </v>

140
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 2>wide and when you say I'm a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people see some of these guys or some of</v>

141
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:16.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.033
<v Speaker 2>at the convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy running around without a shirt </v>

143
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 2>and some of them were crazy pieces.</v>

144
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.800
<v Speaker 2>That was the worst thing that happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get to that in a second,</v>

145
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 2>but that it's bad because it's based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual.</v>

146
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.943
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individually focused people to agree on </v>

147
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 2>something because essentially you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about taking collective action,</v>

148
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:35.711
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

149
00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:37.810
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of anathema to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian cause,</v>

150
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 2>but I mean the Libertarian party is made</v>
<v Speaker 2>up of sincere individuals.</v>

151
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 2>These people really want limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

152
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these people are victims of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>state of people that have been harmed,</v>

153
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:46.963
<v Speaker 2>whether they've been persecuted in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>communities for doing things like </v>

154
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 2>homeschooling or maybe they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink raw milk,</v>

155
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.673
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they want to have the ability to </v>

156
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:54.141
<v Speaker 2>sell that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

157
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Amish farmers and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

158
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of easy to poke fun at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like the naked guy,</v>

159
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:00.254
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

160
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the news often doesn't go in and</v>

161
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:07.330
<v Speaker 2>cover the tales of the single mothers </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are being harmed because their,</v>

162
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 2>their tax rates are so high that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard for them to feed their kids.</v>

163
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.623
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make as compelling a new </v>

164
00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:14.070
<v Speaker 2>story as the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:08:14.071 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 2>dances around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

166
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.510
<v Speaker 2>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is,</v>

167
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 2>is that we're missing the forest for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trees in some sense.</v>

168
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.613
<v Speaker 2>And there are a lot of sincere dedicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>activists and Libertarian party who </v>

169
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:24.794
<v Speaker 2>really just want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not just fighting for their own </v>

170
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:27.404
<v Speaker 2>freedom and many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them are sincere patriots who </v>

171
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:30.614
<v Speaker 2>are fighting for the freedom of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fellow countrymen and they just see the </v>

172
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 2>two parties as being one in the same in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense that they really.</v>

173
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:38.510
<v Speaker 2>That their solutions are just more </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

174
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.600
<v Speaker 2>So that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

175
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of the untold story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the heroes of the Libertarian party,</v>

176
00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 2>which we don't see very often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

177
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:44.954
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to spend most of our time </v>

178
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 2>talking about looking forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do have to look back a little bit</v>

179
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:49.304
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

180
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.773
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me 2016 was a massive disaster for </v>

181
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 2>you guys because</v>

182
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said this a billion times.</v>

183
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 1>First off I voted for Gary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

184
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.373
<v Speaker 1>I've had Gary Johnson on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The candidacy ultimately was just </v>

185
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:06.024
<v Speaker 1>terrible and I think if there was ever a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year where the libertarians or any </v>

186
00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:10.410
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the Greens,</v>

187
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 1>whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although obviously I agree more with you</v>

188
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:13.510
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

189
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but if there was ever a year where there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to be a mark made,</v>

190
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the presidency,</v>

191
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>but a mark to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was it.</v>

192
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 1>There was so much discussed with trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Clinton.</v>

193
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

194
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you this topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

195
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.250
<v Speaker 2>this turns me into Salt Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

196
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:30.723
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you usually walk around with a </v>

197
00:09:31.841 --> 00:09:33.340
<v Speaker 2>musket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't make the,</v>

198
00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:34.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the far the flintlock right?</v>

199
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stuff,</v>

200
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.090
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get my hackles up.</v>

201
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.953
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very difficult to be in this </v>

202
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:43.180
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the position of having tried to</v>

203
00:09:43.181 --> 00:09:45.070
<v Speaker 2>stop that right now having kind of seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

204
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.053
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing more frustrating and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think a lot of libertarian see this in </v>

205
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.833
<v Speaker 2>so many other ways on society as a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we see things kind of rushing </v>

206
00:09:52.931 --> 00:09:54.790
<v Speaker 2>toward a cliff and you're screaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

207
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.653
<v Speaker 2>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to tell people the </v>

208
00:09:57.941 --> 00:09:58.774
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better make them laugh or else </v>

209
00:09:59.631 --> 00:10:02.740
<v Speaker 2>they'll kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A and a that's happening in society.</v>

210
00:10:02.741 --> 00:10:03.574
<v Speaker 2>But with the Libertarian party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were so many times when the </v>

211
00:10:05.801 --> 00:10:06.634
<v Speaker 2>account at the incompetence was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>displayed pre-primary and people either </v>

212
00:10:10.421 --> 00:10:12.430
<v Speaker 2>weren't paying attention or they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>applauding it.</v>

213
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.553
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's videos of some of the </v>

214
00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:17.650
<v Speaker 2>gaps and stumbles and one on before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>convention.</v>

215
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.783
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think there's any excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people who take </v>

216
00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:21.664
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for what it was need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take responsibility because they had </v>

217
00:10:24.431 --> 00:10:28.120
<v Speaker 2>every opportunity to try and stop it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sort of cheered it on.</v>

218
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:28.954
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Libertarian party has a lot of the </v>

219
00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:34.981
<v Speaker 2>same problems that the major two party </v>
<v Speaker 2>has with cults of personality and things</v>

220
00:10:35.471 --> 00:10:38.620
<v Speaker 2>like that and with none of the upsides </v>
<v Speaker 2>of actually winning elections.</v>

221
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.000
<v Speaker 2>So that's the problems of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fighting a in a third party.</v>

222
00:10:43.001 --> 00:10:43.834
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

223
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:44.783
<v Speaker 1>is there a bigger issue here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that for the specific stumbles </v>

224
00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>that Gary made once he got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nomination,</v>

225
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:51.683
<v Speaker 1>and again I liked him as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a decent guy and I hope </v>

226
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:57.060
<v Speaker 1>you'll come back here and I'd be happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to discuss all this stuff with him.</v>

227
00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

228
00:10:58.651 --> 00:10:59.484
<v Speaker 1>that the bigger issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only time anyone ever talked about </v>

229
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.633
<v Speaker 1>the libertarians was when he either made</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gaff or when the naked guy ran round </v>

230
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 1>beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was virtually no coverage.</v>

231
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:12.300
<v Speaker 1>So it was almost as if you had to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlandish things.</v>

232
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:13.134
<v Speaker 1>So I watched the libertarian debates and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they needed to say more crazy </v>

233
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 1>things if anyone was going to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention as even though I don't believe</v>

234
00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 1>that generally related to to</v>

235
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.290
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not about what you say,</v>

236
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:26.240
<v Speaker 2>it's about how you say it very </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently.</v>

237
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.313
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so sometimes it was just Gary's </v>

238
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.413
<v Speaker 2>delivery that came off as awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't necessarily what he was </v>

239
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:32.780
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way that he was saying it,</v>

240
00:11:32.781 --> 00:11:35.040
<v Speaker 2>which I think puts people off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

241
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:35.874
<v Speaker 2>and the thing about Donald trump that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think was so attractive was that he was </v>

242
00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:40.700
<v Speaker 2>giving the last year was a crazy bastard</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

243
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

244
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.040
<v Speaker 2>and libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy bastards.</v>

245
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:44.350
<v Speaker 2>That could have been our year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

246
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

247
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.033
<v Speaker 2>with the rise of the alt right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really what propelled in many </v>

248
00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:50.960
<v Speaker 2>ways helped propel donald to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidency.</v>

249
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.670
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

250
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.880
<v Speaker 2>were sincere conservatives who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for a,</v>

251
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.670
<v Speaker 2>a third option,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

252
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 2>they wanted somebody who could take down</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary.</v>

253
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.203
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the real strategy </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem was simply that it looked as if </v>

254
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.080
<v Speaker 2>gary and bill were sort of cozying up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary,</v>

255
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 2>which is what nobody in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States wanted because they rejected her.</v>

256
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.900
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't so much what Gary was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

257
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:14.734
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was relied a little bit more on </v>

258
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 2>tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

259
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the delivery was not that good,</v>

260
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the gas were horrible,</v>

261
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.933
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really just comes down to not being </v>

262
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:26.230
<v Speaker 2>able to read the political winds of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the time.</v>

263
00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:28.230
<v Speaker 2>And that's really where we suffered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.103
<v Speaker 2>Without getting too thick in the weeds </v>
<v Speaker 2>on just the machinations behind the </v>

265
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:32.644
<v Speaker 2>scene of the party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think people really </v>

266
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.410
<v Speaker 2>understand like what happens by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

267
00:12:36.411 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 2>So we know the Democrats have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive machine.</v>

268
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 2>We know it's deeply corrupt and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that has been exposed.</v>

269
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.770
<v Speaker 2>The Republicans also have a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful machine.</v>

270
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's quite as corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who knows what is,</v>

271
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.990
<v Speaker 2>what is the underpinnings of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian machine,</v>

272
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 2>like what's going on behind the scenes?</v>

273
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Who's in charge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

274
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anarchy,</v>

275
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

276
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.120
<v Speaker 2>they have the Libertarian National </v>
<v Speaker 2>Committee,</v>

277
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 2>their job is to run candidates for </v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

278
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

279
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.873
<v Speaker 2>I think the good thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Libertarian party is that anybody can </v>

280
00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:05.350
<v Speaker 2>participate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

281
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.323
<v Speaker 2>They sound like a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have super delegates and things </v>

282
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:08.854
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean anybody can become a delegate if </v>

283
00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 2>you joined the Libertarian Party and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your state convention.</v>

284
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:13.683
<v Speaker 2>So the way that the Libertarian party </v>
<v Speaker 2>works is it's powered by the people </v>

285
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't,</v>

286
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some shadowy Koch money,</v>

287
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Koch brothers left years ago.</v>

288
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:21.903
<v Speaker 2>So it's really just powered by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>activist and the people who want to try </v>

289
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 2>and see these ideas be put into public </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

290
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Now there are some people who actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

291
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.233
<v Speaker 2>they caucus with the party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want the party to </v>

292
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:34.600
<v Speaker 2>actually win elections for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for multitudes of reasons.</v>

293
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.433
<v Speaker 2>One being perhaps that they think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a system wide collapsed and </v>

294
00:13:38.171 --> 00:13:39.580
<v Speaker 2>libertarians will get blamed for it if </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

295
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:40.423
<v Speaker 2>if there was a libertarian president and</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one is that they think that the </v>

296
00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:43.504
<v Speaker 2>parties should be educational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got all these different </v>

297
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:47.210
<v Speaker 2>factions in the party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

298
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.053
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of them are sincere and </v>

299
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.100
<v Speaker 2>committed activists who really want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring about change,</v>

300
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.870
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to the machinations,</v>

301
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 2>it's what you see for the most part is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you get.</v>

302
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:56.044
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some backroom dealings and </v>

303
00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 2>things that go on and so a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure and hassling that goes onto the</v>

304
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:00.814
<v Speaker 2>convention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People Endorse Bill Weld will give you </v>

305
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:03.604
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that story in the Bible where </v>

306
00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:06.184
<v Speaker 2>like they take juices and Satan is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will bow before me and I know </v>

307
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:10.750
<v Speaker 2>bill well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

308
00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:11.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

309
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:12.610
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

310
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff happens.</v>

311
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.570
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part it's what you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what you get.</v>

312
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:17.843
<v Speaker 2>Was there a moment a after Gary got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nomination that you would have </v>

313
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:25.420
<v Speaker 2>considered being his vp or did they </v>
<v Speaker 2>announce once he got the nomination,</v>

314
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:27.520
<v Speaker 2>did they say they were a team </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately?</v>

315
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was running to be the VP.</v>

316
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.920
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing was this,</v>

317
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mistakes that I made at the </v>

318
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:36.110
<v Speaker 2>convention was that I actually took the </v>
<v Speaker 2>principal,</v>

319
00:14:36.111 --> 00:14:40.030
<v Speaker 2>moves over the pragmatic moves and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>just explain this very briefly.</v>

320
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 2>So there was a brief period of time when</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people said,</v>

321
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want just go run for the VP slot.</v>

322
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.193
<v Speaker 2>But because I was trying to think for </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the good of the party and for the </v>

323
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>good of the ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought to myself,</v>

324
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.843
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well Gary hates me and I wouldn't want </v>

325
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 2>to be hamstrung by a VP that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand.</v>

326
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.780
<v Speaker 2>And he obviously wanted bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

327
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 2>the delegates thought that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

328
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:05.330
<v Speaker 2>So I was trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

329
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 2>I gave into the will of the majority and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

330
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do this because I think</v>

331
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cripple the ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then later,</v>

332
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:12.843
<v Speaker 2>I stupidly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that Gary had </v>

333
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:16.520
<v Speaker 2>threatened that if he didn't get bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>weld,</v>

334
00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:17.354
<v Speaker 2>he would quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I had been the VP then I would </v>

335
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:24.120
<v Speaker 2>have been a candidate if gary had quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I should have just stuck it.</v>

336
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:24.973
<v Speaker 2>Dual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect he wouldn't have chose you </v>

337
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:26.760
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

338
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.593
<v Speaker 2>but they choose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how the Libertarian party is </v>

339
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:30.524
<v Speaker 2>different from the major two parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The delegates choose the vice </v>

340
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 2>presidential candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I really wanted to be a bug chunk,</v>

341
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.090
<v Speaker 2>I could've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could've taken my gun out of the trash</v>

342
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.043
<v Speaker 2>and mounted a campaign to try and be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>VP pick with the hopes that Gary would </v>

343
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:42.740
<v Speaker 2>quit.</v>

344
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 2>But that's just being again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a jerk.</v>

345
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I already have been labeled a jerk so </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get away from them.</v>

346
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.110
<v Speaker 2>So my last question to you at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be about 20,</v>

347
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:53.720
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

348
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 2>but as a lead into that then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you learned that lesson there.</v>

349
00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:58.244
<v Speaker 2>So do you think you would do things </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently next time before you even </v>

350
00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:01.880
<v Speaker 2>tell me if 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 is an option?</v>

351
00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:02.714
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would definitely do things </v>

352
00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:04.760
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

353
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are certain things that you </v>

354
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 2>learned from the process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

355
00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:09.490
<v Speaker 2>hindsight is 20 slash 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

356
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

357
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.293
<v Speaker 2>I think that tactically I made some </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistakes but print from a principal </v>

358
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:16.310
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did everything right,</v>

359
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.620
<v Speaker 2>raised money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grassroots way online,</v>

360
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing live streams and going around</v>

361
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we raised $120,000,</v>

362
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.581
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in,</v>

363
00:16:24.581 --> 00:16:25.414
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my campaign pioneered many of the </v>

364
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 2>campaigns in the future for people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no power,</v>

365
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:30.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

366
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 2>People who are grassroots who can come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of nowhere and I think I showed that</v>

367
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 2>people who are sincere committed </v>
<v Speaker 2>activists can,</v>

368
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.150
<v Speaker 2>can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are some things that I would do</v>

369
00:16:38.151 --> 00:16:38.984
<v Speaker 2>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of it's just sort of </v>

370
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.543
<v Speaker 2>parliamentary procedure things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much for you as an outsider running </v>

371
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 2>on an outsider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ticket,</v>

372
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.253
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was about raising money because that to </v>

373
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:51.500
<v Speaker 2>me is the root of all the problems right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

374
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

375
00:16:52.431 --> 00:16:53.264
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing was was that I found </v>
<v Speaker 2>about raising money is that when things </v>

376
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.380
<v Speaker 2>are good and you're happy and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing well,</v>

377
00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will send you money.</v>

378
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.280
<v Speaker 2>But there's nothing that raises money </v>
<v Speaker 2>like controversy.</v>

379
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.383
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so ironic because I was just </v>

380
00:17:04.971 --> 00:17:06.590
<v Speaker 2>their keynote speaker this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

381
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:07.933
<v Speaker 2>the Colorado Libertarian Party </v>
<v Speaker 2>disinvited me from their debate and I </v>

382
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:15.120
<v Speaker 2>was in Illinois at the time and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>there with my,</v>

383
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 2>my staff.</v>

384
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.641
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

385
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:17.474
<v Speaker 2>well you're not invited because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with some of the radical </v>

386
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>anarchists on one of their base </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical principles.</v>

387
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:23.011
<v Speaker 2>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

388
00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 2>you're not libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not invited.</v>

389
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.290
<v Speaker 2>What principle is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the,</v>

390
00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:27.890
<v Speaker 2>the nap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nap,</v>

391
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:29.720
<v Speaker 2>the nonaggression principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

392
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.663
<v Speaker 2>which many libertarians believe that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the centerpiece of libertarian </v>

393
00:17:33.891 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I in no uncertain terms completely</v>

394
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:40.670
<v Speaker 2>reject simply because in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it leads one to a form,</v>

395
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 2>a strict form of pacifism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

396
00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:45.280
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't account for self defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they,</v>

397
00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:46.770
<v Speaker 2>they dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

398
00:17:46.771 --> 00:17:47.604
<v Speaker 2>but aggression being a sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a term that can be broadly used in many </v>

399
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:51.984
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you different define as </v>

400
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:54.480
<v Speaker 2>aggression?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It leads one to consider.</v>

401
00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we will need a court system to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Suss it out,</v>

402
00:17:56.371 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 2>which would imply a government which </v>
<v Speaker 2>would end the argument for anarchy,</v>

403
00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have gotten,</v>

404
00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 2>they disagree and they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very mad at me for saying that,</v>

405
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.113
<v Speaker 2>but so you're taking in that specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what you would argue is just a more </v>

406
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:11.150
<v Speaker 2>realistic approach or a more functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>

407
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a matter of realism.</v>

408
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of,</v>

409
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.390
<v Speaker 2>of real true principle simply because </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people have argued,</v>

410
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:19.770
<v Speaker 2>and boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to make people mad,</v>

411
00:18:19.771 --> 00:18:20.210
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

412
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.043
<v Speaker 2>in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concept of we're putting this on </v>

413
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:23.934
<v Speaker 2>youtube and youtube comments or anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lovely liberal friends are gonna </v>

414
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.510
<v Speaker 2>like it kind of a heretic in libertarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>circles for this,</v>

415
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.823
<v Speaker 2>but simply many libertarians have argued</v>
<v Speaker 2>and many have told me directly to my </v>

416
00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:35.394
<v Speaker 2>face that the evil of government is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so horrible that it's better that we </v>

417
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 2>have a society where it may be immoral </v>
<v Speaker 2>to allow a child to starve to death,</v>

418
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's not illegal simply because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about the initiation of force.</v>

419
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I like to play the,</v>

420
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.210
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

421
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.650
<v Speaker 2>the puzzle game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

422
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 2>if you walk past a homeless person on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the street,</v>

423
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 2>they're starving to death and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>feed them.</v>

424
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Have you committed a crime?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

425
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Have you initiated force?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

426
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.143
<v Speaker 2>If you have a child and it's your child </v>
<v Speaker 2>and by neglect you allow that child to </v>

427
00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:07.830
<v Speaker 2>starve to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you committed a crime?</v>

428
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.753
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you initiated force know so that </v>

429
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.130
<v Speaker 2>that's really where it comes down to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rights of children is,</v>

430
00:19:14.131 --> 00:19:17.790
<v Speaker 2>is sort of where we start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not some third party may have</v>

431
00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:18.624
<v Speaker 2>a right to come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that controversy was enough to make </v>

432
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:21.864
<v Speaker 2>the libertarian part of Colorado say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it made my activist so angry that </v>

433
00:19:25.591 --> 00:19:26.424
<v Speaker 2>they started pouring money my coffers </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying Austin drive to Colorado right </v>

434
00:19:29.431 --> 00:19:30.264
<v Speaker 2>now and we drove all night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirteen hours straight to the </v>

435
00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 2>convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took second place.</v>

436
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:34.614
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat up on Gary a little bit and raise </v>

437
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:37.194
<v Speaker 2>money so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating because this </v>

438
00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.810
<v Speaker 2>infighting of all the parties I find </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>

439
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Like just the inability for anyone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build a bridge these days,</v>

440
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:49.500
<v Speaker 2>which is so much of what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a political insider,</v>

441
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.453
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm trying to do around here is</v>
<v Speaker 2>build some bridges and show people you </v>

442
00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:53.904
<v Speaker 2>can disagree on abortion and we'll talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that in a little bit and a bunch </v>

443
00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:59.910
<v Speaker 2>of different things and still find some </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic principles to believe in.</v>

444
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.210
<v Speaker 2>But let's just talk about the general </v>
<v Speaker 2>role of government because that's really</v>

445
00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:04.044
<v Speaker 2>what this all comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you touched on it just a little bit </v>

446
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.043
<v Speaker 2>up top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me the basic things that you </v>

447
00:20:09.031 --> 00:20:12.090
<v Speaker 2>believe government should exist for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifics,</v>

448
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:12.924
<v Speaker 2>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just the ideas of liberty and that </v>

449
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:17.520
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the libertarianism isn't really about</v>

450
00:20:17.521 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about self government.</v>

451
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.970
<v Speaker 2>So that's the concept that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

452
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:22.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and if you have a,</v>

453
00:20:22.951 --> 00:20:25.050
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a moral just society,</v>

454
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.200
<v Speaker 2>then people should be self-governed.</v>

455
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

456
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.393
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different from the sort of FDR </v>

457
00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:31.944
<v Speaker 2>definition of freedom because FDR and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Social Democrats believe that </v>

458
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.230
<v Speaker 2>freedom means freedom from want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not free if you're hungry,</v>

459
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.580
<v Speaker 2>that's their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their definition.</v>

460
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.623
<v Speaker 2>So the question really comes down to is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we as Libertarians have a </v>

461
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.980
<v Speaker 2>different concept of freedom from most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because our concept of freedom is</v>

462
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:51.843
<v Speaker 2>the most politically incorrect because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it requires personal responsibility and </v>

463
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 2>when you start telling talking to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>about personal responsibility,</v>

464
00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:58.893
<v Speaker 2>that's when I get angry because as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even libertarians aren't perfect </v>

465
00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 2>when it comes down to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>

466
00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:05.530
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to the actual role of </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

467
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:10.210
<v Speaker 2>it should be the absolute minimum that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is required in order to sustain life,</v>

468
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.950
<v Speaker 2>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the pursuit of happiness.</v>

469
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.710
<v Speaker 2>That's the declaration of independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the law,</v>

470
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.873
<v Speaker 2>but the constitution being the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has very specific enumerated powers </v>

471
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.050
<v Speaker 2>as sometimes conservatives I think make </v>
<v Speaker 2>a mistake where they'll say,</v>

472
00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we believe in states rights,</v>

473
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.320
<v Speaker 2>and the Libertarian says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

474
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 2>actually that's a misnomer.</v>

475
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Only people have rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

476
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:31.714
<v Speaker 2>states have powers and the idea is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>those powers should be strictly limited </v>

477
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 2>and enumerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we delegate some of our,</v>

478
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:39.723
<v Speaker 2>some of our power to government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't delegate and have our </v>

479
00:21:41.891 --> 00:21:42.724
<v Speaker 2>rights to government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our rights are intrinsic or rights are </v>

480
00:21:44.601 --> 00:21:45.434
<v Speaker 2>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are self evident as to our </v>

481
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:48.034
<v Speaker 2>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so libertarians simply believe that </v>

482
00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:52.054
<v Speaker 2>the individual should be self govern and</v>
<v Speaker 2>governed to is to the greatest extent </v>

483
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:57.640
<v Speaker 2>possible until that self governance is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

484
00:21:57.641 --> 00:21:59.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do not police yourself,</v>

485
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 2>you will be policed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in or so as long as I'm,</v>

486
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever action that you're taking </v>

487
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:05.344
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it created some negative externality on </v>

488
00:22:06.941 --> 00:22:08.950
<v Speaker 2>the community in that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

489
00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:10.650
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

490
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.513
<v Speaker 2>What are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may be polluting or something like </v>

491
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:13.174
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were problems with libertarians </v>

492
00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:14.554
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we believe in a strict definition of </v>

493
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:16.960
<v Speaker 2>property rights.</v>

494
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Speaker 2>So essentially what government should do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it should,</v>

495
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjudicate disputes between property </v>

496
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:27.691
<v Speaker 2>rights holders and it should prosecute </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal cases of force and fraud really</v>

497
00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:29.494
<v Speaker 2>is what it should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really the limited role of </v>

498
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:32.764
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would take like sanitation away </v>

499
00:22:34.511 --> 00:22:37.570
<v Speaker 2>from the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would take the US Postal Service.</v>

500
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.773
<v Speaker 2>All of those kinds of things were easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we're keeping courts where we're </v>

501
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.910
<v Speaker 2>keeping a cops and then nuclear weapons </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion.</v>

502
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:48.760
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

503
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.950
<v Speaker 2>but that's cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>courts nukes.</v>

504
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:51.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops,</v>

505
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:52.430
<v Speaker 2>courts have nukes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

506
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I think we just came up with your slogan</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a couple different way.</v>

507
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.630
<v Speaker 2>If I ever write a police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

508
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.040
<v Speaker 2>How is any of this different or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider yourself an objectivist?</v>

509
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

510
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:04.323
<v Speaker 2>I flirt with them now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can really get you in trouble because I </v>

511
00:23:05.741 --> 00:23:07.110
<v Speaker 2>know you mentioned Iran.</v>

512
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.953
<v Speaker 2>People go nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot of it and I've had many </v>

513
00:23:09.581 --> 00:23:10.320
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

514
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.550
<v Speaker 2>your own Brooke who is books right over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

515
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she rejects altruism.</v>

516
00:23:15.251 --> 00:23:17.360
<v Speaker 2>I get a joy out of doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know she,</v>

517
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.730
<v Speaker 2>the argument is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

518
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.750
<v Speaker 2>if you get a joy out of doing it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>other good people,</v>

519
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.810
<v Speaker 2>then it's selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not entirely selfish.</v>

520
00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:23.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

521
00:23:23.211 --> 00:23:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

522
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is a,</v>

523
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.453
<v Speaker 2>there is a desire for us to sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in order to do it for the </v>

524
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:33.304
<v Speaker 2>greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people think that the government </v>

525
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:38.140
<v Speaker 2>should require that sacrifice on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like mandatory service.</v>

526
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 2>But as a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in voluntary service,</v>

527
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 2>a voluntary military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I were to,</v>

528
00:23:44.051 --> 00:23:44.884
<v Speaker 2>if I had served in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be doing it out of a sense of </v>

529
00:23:47.151 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 2>patriotism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be,</v>

530
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.540
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of selflessness.</v>

531
00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.340
<v Speaker 2>I think many people have been drafted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

532
00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:53.174
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of people who fought in world </v>
<v Speaker 2>war against the Nazis were doing it </v>

533
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:56.443
<v Speaker 2>because they were fighting for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>family and they were fighting out of a </v>

534
00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:00.410
<v Speaker 2>greater sense of oneself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

535
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.370
<v Speaker 2>sometimes libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think objectives are sort of immune to</v>

536
00:24:04.371 --> 00:24:05.750
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

537
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:09.120
<v Speaker 2>but not all libertarians are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some Libertarians do what they do out of</v>

538
00:24:09.121 --> 00:24:09.954
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the sense of what's good for the </v>

539
00:24:10.941 --> 00:24:12.050
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

540
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

541
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.963
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is what I would say was </v>

542
00:24:15.101 --> 00:24:15.934
<v Speaker 2>selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I actually do want to see humanity </v>

543
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:18.403
<v Speaker 2>flourish and thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just simply don't believe that </v>

544
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:21.470
<v Speaker 2>government is the best way for us to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

545
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't see actually a major </v>

546
00:24:23.691 --> 00:24:26.300
<v Speaker 2>distinction there from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what you would believe,</v>

547
00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:27.134
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to an objectivist because </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing for yourself what is selfishly </v>

548
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:32.060
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always view that as,</v>

549
00:24:32.061 --> 00:24:32.894
<v Speaker 2>that's not necessarily gonna hurt your </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbor because if you're smart and </v>

550
00:24:34.571 --> 00:24:35.404
<v Speaker 2>you're doing what's good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be dumping in your </v>

551
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:39.500
<v Speaker 2>neighbor's lawn because you want your </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbor to be happy too.</v>

552
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.333
<v Speaker 2>So like sometimes don't you just do good</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing for people even though it doesn't </v>

553
00:24:43.491 --> 00:24:44.360
<v Speaker 2>benefit you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

554
00:24:44.361 --> 00:24:45.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may make you feel good,</v>

555
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.843
<v Speaker 2>but every once in a while I catch myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing things for people like </v>

556
00:24:48.981 --> 00:24:51.410
<v Speaker 2>opening a door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>handing a quarter to a homeless person,</v>

557
00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.253
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody my phone to use or something </v>

558
00:24:53.661 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just not big.</v>

559
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.290
<v Speaker 2>And like sometimes I don't derive any </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure from it.</v>

560
00:24:57.291 --> 00:24:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I just do it automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then that,</v>

561
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.280
<v Speaker 2>then we're on the philosophical piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

562
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:02.114
<v Speaker 2>Is that somehow actually for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it almost to me it's almost </v>

563
00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:07.750
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant in a sort of real world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

564
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 2>That's probably my biggest issue with </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectivist is just simply the,</v>

565
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:12.703
<v Speaker 2>the again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's distasteful to me because I </v>

566
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.930
<v Speaker 2>really disliked called some personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

567
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.070
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just,</v>

568
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:18.963
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a contrarian and a skeptic and I </v>

569
00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:23.480
<v Speaker 2>just really like to pick things apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find the flaws in it,</v>

570
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:24.314
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what gets you in trouble and it </v>

571
00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:27.170
<v Speaker 2>gets you branded a heretic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

572
00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:30.250
<v Speaker 2>when you find flaws and you want to pull</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thread,</v>

573
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.093
<v Speaker 2>eventually sweater comes apart just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I like to see what things are </v>

574
00:25:32.901 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 2>made of.</v>

575
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.483
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't like to accept things just </v>

576
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:38.990
<v Speaker 2>because this Marie Rothbart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>senator Iran set it right.</v>

577
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Or Ron Paul said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

578
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.760
<v Speaker 2>now it just angered the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else appreciate.</v>

579
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I normally don't have a list of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to anger,</v>

580
00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:46.484
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like I should have had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little Glen Beck whiteboard here and I </v>

581
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.510
<v Speaker 2>could just knock it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't,</v>

582
00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:52.650
<v Speaker 2>we haven't hit feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sjws patients.</v>

583
00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Patients will get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

584
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:56.750
<v Speaker 2>So we've taken back a lot of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>with government.</v>

585
00:25:56.751 --> 00:26:00.440
<v Speaker 2>We've taken back all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's actually possible?</v>

586
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.573
<v Speaker 2>Like is that the government too big at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point and our people to dumb down </v>

587
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 2>to understand why big government is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

588
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.900
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I hear a lot of progressive saying,</v>

589
00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:12.734
<v Speaker 2>you know that it just the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>should redistribute and all of these </v>

590
00:26:15.651 --> 00:26:19.640
<v Speaker 2>government programs and they get upset </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we cut money to the arts.</v>

591
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.473
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's going to stop art </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it actually might help art </v>

592
00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.653
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've just become so numb to how </v>

593
00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:29.510
<v Speaker 2>things work that if you were to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse some of this stuff,</v>

594
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.373
<v Speaker 2>you might do some really irreparable </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage in ways that maybe we can't even </v>

595
00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:34.470
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

596
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.350
<v Speaker 2>at the risk of sounding like a founding </v>
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>

597
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:40.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call Tj and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we should've been doing this.</v>

598
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.180
<v Speaker 2>The natural tendency is for government </v>
<v Speaker 2>to grow in liberty to shrink.</v>

599
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.330
<v Speaker 2>So do I think we can go back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can.</v>

600
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:50.430
<v Speaker 2>The only problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we have to adopt,</v>

601
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 2>not the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the principles,</v>

602
00:26:52.051 --> 00:26:52.884
<v Speaker 2>but the tactics of some of our opponents</v>
<v Speaker 2>were the Fabian Socialists who want to </v>

603
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:56.364
<v Speaker 2>try and grow government bit by bit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to try and fight a </v>

604
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:00.630
<v Speaker 2>war game of inches.</v>

605
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.463
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to have to take ground </v>

606
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.290
<v Speaker 2>bit by bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I do think that we can go back.</v>

607
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:05.780
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that with,</v>

608
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.653
<v Speaker 2>with my movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Liberty Movement is that we're not </v>

609
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 2>content with small games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

610
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:11.424
<v Speaker 2>We want to see big games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to start seeing major victories </v>

611
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:17.640
<v Speaker 2>because we see our opponents getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>major victories all the time and I think</v>

612
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:19.110
<v Speaker 2>we've got to be a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>patient.</v>

613
00:27:19.111 --> 00:27:20.110
<v Speaker 2>We've got to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:24.450
<v Speaker 2>on the short game before we can worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the long game in some ways.</v>

615
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Why doesn't the party do anything down </v>
<v Speaker 2>ticket?</v>

616
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that you only hear about </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians come national election time</v>

617
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:33.750
<v Speaker 2>and as far as I know there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there any,</v>

618
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.220
<v Speaker 2>there must be some randomly avowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians in there.</v>

619
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sort of.</v>

620
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.273
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of incentives because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you run as a like a senator or a </v>

621
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.470
<v Speaker 2>president as a libertarian a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

622
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.090
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell that you're going to get if you run</v>

623
00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:52.020
<v Speaker 2>for lower office.</v>

624
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.260
<v Speaker 2>But at least there's the benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a little bit of notoriety,</v>

625
00:27:55.261 --> 00:27:56.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of fame,</v>

626
00:27:56.311 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 2>perhaps a little bit of opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>advance your ideas.</v>

627
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're running for the,</v>

628
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.823
<v Speaker 2>for the dog catcher as a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get the same amount of </v>

629
00:28:05.011 --> 00:28:07.230
<v Speaker 2>hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's your neighbor next door that is</v>

630
00:28:07.231 --> 00:28:08.064
<v Speaker 2>going to give it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that the incentives are </v>

631
00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:10.990
<v Speaker 2>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 2>messed up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also we just,</v>

633
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.103
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just a lot of people </v>

634
00:28:14.521 --> 00:28:16.020
<v Speaker 2>don't know what it means to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian.</v>

635
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people who will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

636
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Bill Maher says he's a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

637
00:28:20.161 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the guy,</v>

638
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

639
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.920
<v Speaker 2>John Bolton Ambassador,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Bolton came on my show once and was</v>

640
00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:27.540
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a libertarian,</v>

641
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:31.290
<v Speaker 2>really invade Russia because actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

642
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I think of it more as a neocon a well </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

643
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.510
<v Speaker 2>to some neo constant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to make more people angry.</v>

644
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.513
<v Speaker 2>But here's some neo-cons they actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider themselves anarchists in a </v>

645
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no borders,</v>

646
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that if we see somebody,</v>

647
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>

648
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.020
<v Speaker 2>if we see somebody like a genocide going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on overseas and things like that,</v>

649
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.093
<v Speaker 2>Wellesley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we believe in a borderless world and </v>

650
00:28:51.091 --> 00:28:52.740
<v Speaker 2>these are all humans members of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human race,</v>

651
00:28:52.741 --> 00:28:53.574
<v Speaker 2>why should we not intervene overseas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of Democrats agree with </v>

652
00:28:55.981 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

653
00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.120
<v Speaker 2>That we should be stepping into Darfur </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Sudan and Yemen and,</v>

654
00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:01.160
<v Speaker 2>and we should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

655
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 2>having humanitarian interventions around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

656
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:04.973
<v Speaker 2>And so the neoconservatives in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of themselves as libertarian </v>

657
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 2>humanitarians and in some way because by</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing democracy to the Middle East,</v>

658
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.840
<v Speaker 2>they are spreading freedom around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

659
00:29:15.841 --> 00:29:17.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's their thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only problem is,</v>

660
00:29:17.421 --> 00:29:19.440
<v Speaker 2>is that you buy in using government for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

661
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:20.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

662
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:21.600
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're ends,</v>

663
00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:24.000
<v Speaker 2>may be positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the means that they,</v>

664
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:25.650
<v Speaker 2>that they use end up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

665
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:29.400
<v Speaker 2>with the destruction of regimes and with</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanitarian crisis.</v>

666
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.773
<v Speaker 2>So what do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would your position beyond that </v>

667
00:29:32.991 --> 00:29:35.850
<v Speaker 2>that I know that obviously you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be for nation building,</v>

668
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:36.893
<v Speaker 2>but in the case of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a true genocide or a case of what's </v>

669
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:40.944
<v Speaker 2>happening in Syria now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the general libertarian ideas </v>

670
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.330
<v Speaker 2>thought of as isolationists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you fall in some sense the,</v>

671
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.183
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the returns are isolationists </v>

672
00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:50.344
<v Speaker 2>actually many of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more of a Paleo conservative </v>

673
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 2>thing that people who want to build a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall on the southern border,</v>

674
00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:56.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they want to stop trade overseas.</v>

675
00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are much more isolationist.</v>

676
00:29:58.181 --> 00:29:59.014
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

677
00:29:59.230 --> 00:29:59.671
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

678
00:29:59.671 --> 00:30:04.210
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to solve these problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're going to use government to</v>

679
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:07.510
<v Speaker 2>solve foreign policy problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should use the constitution.</v>

680
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.500
<v Speaker 2>That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

681
00:30:08.501 --> 00:30:11.230
<v Speaker 2>and the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we ignore the constitution.</v>

682
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.420
<v Speaker 2>The constitution actually gives.</v>

683
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.190
<v Speaker 2>And Libertarians don't talk this up </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

684
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:16.024
<v Speaker 2>The constitution does give the congress </v>
<v Speaker 2>some authorization to act in a manner </v>

685
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:20.944
<v Speaker 2>that would make liberals very angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that it would allow the </v>

686
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.800
<v Speaker 2>congress to lay a letter of mark and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprisal.</v>

687
00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:29.260
<v Speaker 2>The last time they did that was the war </v>
<v Speaker 2>of 1812.</v>

688
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.720
<v Speaker 2>So international laws and norms have </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

689
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

690
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.050
<v Speaker 2>if it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a terrorist activity,</v>

691
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.360
<v Speaker 2>essentially it would be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar to how you,</v>

692
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:38.243
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we dealt with a Sama bin Ladin </v>

693
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.010
<v Speaker 2>because we have such a deep and profound</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of patriotism.</v>

694
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:42.844
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think only the government can kill </v>

695
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:44.764
<v Speaker 2>terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were not willing to get go all 1776 on </v>

696
00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:51.880
<v Speaker 2>that bus and higher a higher merck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really what we're talking about</v>

697
00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:53.680
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a case like that,</v>

698
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 2>like I've been lied in type case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would actually be for that you hire,</v>

699
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.233
<v Speaker 2>you're basically subcontracting </v>
<v Speaker 2>contracting our army out and it's </v>

700
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.320
<v Speaker 2>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would argue,</v>

701
00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:03.154
<v Speaker 2>I assume be would be a cheaper and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective way to Ron Paul after nine </v>

702
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:09.210
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 actually introduced legislation</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

703
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:10.163
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go into kill bin Laden using letters </v>

704
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:13.204
<v Speaker 2>of mark and reprisal because at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're following constitutional due </v>

705
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:16.330
<v Speaker 2>processes.</v>

706
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 2>A lot of libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

707
00:31:17.831 --> 00:31:19.060
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

708
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.343
<v Speaker 2>that don't agree with the authorization </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the use of military force have to </v>

709
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:26.680
<v Speaker 2>admit that that was quote unquote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressional authorization.</v>

710
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.773
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the real problem that we were </v>

711
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:33.750
<v Speaker 2>dealing with in terms of law of the laws</v>
<v Speaker 2>of war or that if we declare war on isis</v>

712
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:35.950
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we lose,</v>

713
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:36.784
<v Speaker 2>we're legitimising them as a state actor</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in some ways we don't want to do </v>

714
00:31:40.211 --> 00:31:42.760
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in order for us to behave in a manner</v>

715
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:43.830
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

716
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.570
<v Speaker 2>that is in conduct with constitutional </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles,</v>

717
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.580
<v Speaker 2>reviving Article One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>section eight,</v>

718
00:31:48.581 --> 00:31:52.450
<v Speaker 2>and the letters of mark is a way for us </v>
<v Speaker 2>to follow constitutional processes.</v>

719
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.583
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that liberals aren't going to like </v>

720
00:31:54.881 --> 00:31:55.714
<v Speaker 2>this because if we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>privatizing the military and the </v>

721
00:31:58.091 --> 00:32:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives aren't going to like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not the whole bad ass team.</v>

722
00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hail team six,</v>

723
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:04.930
<v Speaker 2>kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we have the,</v>

724
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Speaker 2>we've got thousands of former veterans </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are out of work who would love to do</v>

725
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:12.790
<v Speaker 2>the United States a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you gave them a contract,</v>

726
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.653
<v Speaker 2>one of the beautiful things about it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>only libertarians are going to like </v>

727
00:32:15.161 --> 00:32:15.994
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that any bounty that they capture </v>

728
00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:20.680
<v Speaker 2>over there can be brought back and sold </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the United States.</v>

729
00:32:20.681 --> 00:32:24.190
<v Speaker 2>So all of those guns that fell into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands of Isis can come back and be sold,</v>

730
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:25.024
<v Speaker 2>not in California where I'm from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have a beautiful new military </v>

731
00:32:29.231 --> 00:32:32.130
<v Speaker 2>grade weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I hear you talk about this now,</v>

732
00:32:32.131 --> 00:32:34.600
<v Speaker 2>but I can go there intellectually with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you for sure.</v>

733
00:32:34.601 --> 00:32:35.434
<v Speaker 2>And I like the idea is that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially if you route things in </v>

734
00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:39.340
<v Speaker 2>the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

735
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I hear you say this though,</v>

736
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:45.880
<v Speaker 2>there's a piece of me going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sounds like Rambo or you know,</v>

737
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.813
<v Speaker 2>it just sounds like some eighties movies</v>
<v Speaker 2>were still owner in where they got a </v>

738
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:51.350
<v Speaker 2>bunch of mercenary.</v>

739
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure this was a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was this partly the rock?</v>

740
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 2>They get a bunch of disgruntled former </v>
<v Speaker 2>military men.</v>

741
00:32:57.411 --> 00:32:59.280
<v Speaker 2>They come together and they find the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

742
00:32:59.281 --> 00:33:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I think Predator was sort of about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

743
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 2>There's an alien that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt.</v>

744
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:02.933
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

745
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.980
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just sounds crazy to people.</v>

746
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying to you it's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just so how do you even get there?</v>

747
00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new ideas or they always sound crazy,</v>

748
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like legalizing marijuana 30,</v>

749
00:33:15.111 --> 00:33:17.010
<v Speaker 2>40 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy,</v>

750
00:33:17.011 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 2>you're stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a stoner,</v>

751
00:33:18.261 --> 00:33:18.531
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

752
00:33:18.531 --> 00:33:19.364
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now we see that things start to </v>

753
00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:21.104
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

754
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy people.</v>

755
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:23.504
<v Speaker 2>Like the problem with this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that is that there's this really </v>

756
00:33:27.501 --> 00:33:29.330
<v Speaker 2>great quote where somebody used the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day on twitter,</v>

757
00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:33.590
<v Speaker 2>they said that I'm a smart people sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>like crazy people to stupid people.</v>

758
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:35.853
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the problem may not be that just </v>

759
00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:39.200
<v Speaker 2>because I'm an opinion is in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>minority.</v>

760
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.600
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

761
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time whenever people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

762
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.430
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy,</v>

763
00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:45.020
<v Speaker 2>nobody agrees with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>

764
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:45.854
<v Speaker 2>maybe most people are kind of stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe you're the crazy ones and the </v>

765
00:33:49.311 --> 00:33:50.144
<v Speaker 2>media is not helping that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At some point you've got to be willing </v>

766
00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:55.130
<v Speaker 2>to put your foot in the ground and take </v>
<v Speaker 2>a stand and say,</v>

767
00:33:55.131 --> 00:33:55.964
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if nobody agrees with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take a stand on principle </v>

768
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.043
<v Speaker 2>and listen to the founding fathers did </v>
<v Speaker 2>not put this into the constitution for </v>

769
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:03.770
<v Speaker 2>no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why they did this?</v>

770
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:04.604
<v Speaker 2>It's because the war of 1776 was </v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily one on the seas by private </v>

771
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 2>mariners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no continental navy.</v>

772
00:34:11.511 --> 00:34:13.700
<v Speaker 2>There was something like maybe six or </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven ships.</v>

773
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.290
<v Speaker 2>There were over a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

774
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.950
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who turned their merchant mariner</v>

775
00:34:18.951 --> 00:34:21.980
<v Speaker 2>ships into dogs of war.</v>

776
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:23.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the days of fighting sale,</v>

777
00:34:23.841 --> 00:34:28.400
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it without those merchant </v>
<v Speaker 2>mariners turned a private tiers,</v>

778
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.230
<v Speaker 2>we would not have won our war of </v>
<v Speaker 2>independence.</v>

779
00:34:30.231 --> 00:34:32.690
<v Speaker 2>They captured hundreds of British ships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

780
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.370
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the going gets tough,</v>

781
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:37.070
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you have to turn to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>private market to solve these things.</v>

782
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.143
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why it's distasteful to the </v>

783
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:42.980
<v Speaker 2>establishment is for two different </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons that conservatives love it.</v>

784
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:43.791
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

785
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:44.624
<v Speaker 2>this is a great idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll never get the liberals on </v>

786
00:34:46.621 --> 00:34:49.130
<v Speaker 2>board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'd much rather trust it to our,</v>

787
00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.050
<v Speaker 2>our Navy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Navy seal team guys.</v>

788
00:34:51.051 --> 00:34:52.520
<v Speaker 2>And the liberals are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

789
00:34:52.521 --> 00:34:53.990
<v Speaker 2>you're privatizing war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

790
00:34:53.991 --> 00:34:54.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>

791
00:34:54.681 --> 00:34:58.580
<v Speaker 2>It's the free market and it's war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very hard to win that battle.</v>

792
00:34:58.581 --> 00:34:59.630
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever I do,</v>

793
00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:03.650
<v Speaker 2>I try and couch it in actual precedent </v>
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

794
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.600
<v Speaker 2>the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the constitution,</v>

795
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.450
<v Speaker 2>that way I think you remained consistent</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

796
00:35:08.451 --> 00:35:08.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

797
00:35:08.931 --> 00:35:11.840
<v Speaker 2>new ideas are always sound crazy until </v>
<v Speaker 2>they finally become accepted.</v>

798
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So speaking of precedent and the </v>

799
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:14.504
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think of the general state </v>

800
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:20.540
<v Speaker 2>of the Constitution right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a pretty beautiful,</v>

801
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:23.330
<v Speaker 2>almost perfect document to be governed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

802
00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.960
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't seem to be what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really governed by anymore.</v>

803
00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:29.330
<v Speaker 2>It's being trampled in every direction </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

804
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:30.223
<v Speaker 2>You can make cases that trump's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trampling it in certain ways with </v>

805
00:35:32.361 --> 00:35:33.890
<v Speaker 2>executive actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

806
00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Obama did plenty of them and George W </v>
<v Speaker 2>dot Bush did plenty of them.</v>

807
00:35:36.021 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 2>So that's a non partisan attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also don't,</v>

808
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:39.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do military actions where we don't </v>

809
00:35:41.101 --> 00:35:41.934
<v Speaker 2>get congressional authorization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was Libya where they call it a </v>

810
00:35:44.281 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut military action or they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>make up terms and you go,</v>

811
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a war.</v>

812
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure if Libya had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>blowing us a bar,</v>

813
00:35:50.791 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Speaker 2>we'd call it a war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

814
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.580
<v Speaker 2>so the general state of how we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

815
00:35:55.581 --> 00:35:57.990
<v Speaker 2>or are not governed by the constitution </v>
<v Speaker 2>in many ways.</v>

816
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 2>I think we're living in a post </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutional republic,</v>

817
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:01.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has some of the trappings of a </v>

818
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:04.970
<v Speaker 2>constitutional republic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

819
00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good thing is,</v>

820
00:36:06.131 --> 00:36:08.930
<v Speaker 2>is that the bill of rights still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still enforced.</v>

821
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:09.773
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress uses the fifth amendment all </v>

822
00:36:10.621 --> 00:36:12.750
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got people in there,</v>

823
00:36:12.751 --> 00:36:14.370
<v Speaker 2>in the hearings that are always having </v>
<v Speaker 2>to plead the fifth.</v>

824
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:16.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

825
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.540
<v Speaker 2>And then they of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

826
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

827
00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.273
<v Speaker 2>the supreme court relies on the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment when it upholds decisions in </v>

828
00:36:22.541 --> 00:36:25.230
<v Speaker 2>like Heller or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or McDonald versus Chicago.</v>

829
00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got the second amendment.</v>

830
00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:27.534
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody would know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe some people would like to get rid </v>

831
00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:29.930
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought,</v>

832
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:30.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

833
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.560
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

834
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:32.623
<v Speaker 2>but most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think cooler heads will prevail on </v>

835
00:36:34.621 --> 00:36:36.150
<v Speaker 2>that issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got the first amendment,</v>

836
00:36:36.151 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 2>which is in retreat in a lot of ways.</v>

837
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.473
<v Speaker 2>College campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably primarily the spots where </v>

838
00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:43.330
<v Speaker 2>they're in retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

839
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:44.440
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

840
00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.710
<v Speaker 2>it's also a retreat in some ways in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media.</v>

841
00:36:46.711 --> 00:36:47.460
<v Speaker 2>This is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.340
<v Speaker 2>the Rubin report is probably so popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>and successful,</v>

843
00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:52.200
<v Speaker 2>not just because you're so tremendously </v>
<v Speaker 2>talented,</v>

844
00:36:52.201 --> 00:36:53.034
<v Speaker 2>but because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because people are seeking out </v>

845
00:36:55.021 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 2>alternate means of information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

846
00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:57.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't live in,</v>

847
00:36:57.921 --> 00:37:01.500
<v Speaker 2>in North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't say that the constitution has</v>

848
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:02.334
<v Speaker 2>been a total failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that in some ways the </v>

849
00:37:04.141 --> 00:37:04.974
<v Speaker 2>constitution was far from perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the founders tried to get rid of </v>

850
00:37:08.641 --> 00:37:09.630
<v Speaker 2>slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

851
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 2>at the signing of the declaration of </v>
<v Speaker 2>independence.</v>

852
00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:12.204
<v Speaker 2>It didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took another 100 years and a bloody </v>

853
00:37:13.951 --> 00:37:15.220
<v Speaker 2>civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

854
00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.820
<v Speaker 2>so there were some institutional </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems with the,</v>

855
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:19.170
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

856
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.213
<v Speaker 2>And we've had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to pass the 13th and the 14th </v>

857
00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:22.950
<v Speaker 2>amendment.</v>

858
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

859
00:37:23.911 --> 00:37:25.510
<v Speaker 2>it took a war for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

860
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:26.641
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

861
00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:27.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

862
00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:31.500
<v Speaker 2>if you look at postwar amendments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you of course you've got things like,</v>

863
00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:32.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

864
00:37:32.551 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 2>you've got the 16th and the 17th </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendments,</v>

865
00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:37.380
<v Speaker 2>which have been the most anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian parts of the constitution.</v>

866
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Now we have a law by bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

867
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in many times the things like the FDA</v>

868
00:37:44.191 --> 00:37:45.040
<v Speaker 2>or the EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

869
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.760
<v Speaker 2>they'll write law and enforce it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

870
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.623
<v Speaker 2>that was definitely alien to the concept</v>
<v Speaker 2>of constitutional law is written by the </v>

871
00:37:51.541 --> 00:37:53.010
<v Speaker 2>founders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with,</v>

872
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:53.903
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to have a bureaucracy </v>

873
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.273
<v Speaker 2>then I think the bureaucracy should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>limited to operating within </v>

874
00:37:58.501 --> 00:38:01.030
<v Speaker 2>constitutional law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they're to going to,</v>

875
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create laws and those laws should have </v>

876
00:38:02.941 --> 00:38:07.170
<v Speaker 2>to be passed by Congress and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those laws or regulations in many ways.</v>

877
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.263
<v Speaker 2>So that's really where the problem comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>is with all the executive branch </v>

878
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 2>agencies that have been created that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

879
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.900
<v Speaker 2>that I think are probably the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem that we have for the record.</v>

880
00:38:15.901 --> 00:38:16.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

881
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.543
<v Speaker 2>that in and of itself it's perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of the way that we can be </v>

882
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:23.310
<v Speaker 2>governed as we humans are the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 2>write this evidence,</v>

883
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.323
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best we've got because we've got a </v>

884
00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:29.160
<v Speaker 2>CNA and we are flawed things that create</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

885
00:38:29.161 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 2>So as perfect as maybe we can create,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course just a,</v>

886
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.440
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an independent thing.</v>

887
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 2>The thing though is that,</v>

888
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.903
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason the founders didn't </v>

889
00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:40.960
<v Speaker 1>build a wall along the southern border </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

890
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:41.794
<v Speaker 1>that can be improved upon because at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time they would have been no need for a </v>

891
00:38:44.231 --> 00:38:47.550
<v Speaker 1>casino down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

892
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned the EPA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

893
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:52.750
<v Speaker 1>the two ones that I hear all the tie or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fruit of drug administration,</v>

894
00:38:52.751 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 1>these are the two that you hear when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say Libertarians are nuts.</v>

895
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.093
<v Speaker 1>Even Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I know he half now identify as </v>

896
00:38:58.991 --> 00:38:59.824
<v Speaker 1>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's for a lot of big government </v>

897
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.340
<v Speaker 1>stuff at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

898
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a couple weeks ago he said </v>

899
00:39:05.591 --> 00:39:06.424
<v Speaker 1>something about that trump got rid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing with the EPA and now they're </v>

900
00:39:10.241 --> 00:39:12.700
<v Speaker 1>going to start jumping in rivers again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is immediately what he said.</v>

901
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:13.773
<v Speaker 1>And to me it's like we now live in 2017 </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everyone has a phone and if the </v>

902
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:18.124
<v Speaker 1>company a block away from his dumping in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the river or the smokes coming out of </v>

903
00:39:21.101 --> 00:39:24.040
<v Speaker 1>their chimney or that everyone would </v>
<v Speaker 1>report on everyone,</v>

904
00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:26.250
<v Speaker 1>that's another problem that society has </v>
<v Speaker 1>altogether.</v>

905
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that we would police ourselves in a </v>

906
00:39:29.021 --> 00:39:31.420
<v Speaker 1>way and as John Stossel who I love would</v>
<v Speaker 1>always say,</v>

907
00:39:31.421 --> 00:39:32.254
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more regulations we keep putting in </v>

908
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.840
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just figuring out other ways to do it,</v>

909
00:39:34.841 --> 00:39:35.674
<v Speaker 1>we just keep putting money in lawyers </v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets and we're not actually </v>

910
00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:38.524
<v Speaker 1>accomplishing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just shifting around bullshit </v>

911
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:42.460
<v Speaker 1>basically all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

912
00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.280
<v Speaker 2>so I can jump in on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

913
00:39:45.281 --> 00:39:45.781
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

914
00:39:45.781 --> 00:39:47.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so two things.</v>

915
00:39:47.201 --> 00:39:49.990
<v Speaker 2>There's EPA and then there's the FDA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very briefly with the EPA,</v>

916
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.083
<v Speaker 2>the EPA was created by Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was created to essentially offer </v>

917
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:55.144
<v Speaker 2>scientific information in court cases </v>
<v Speaker 2>where our property rights were in </v>

918
00:39:57.101 --> 00:40:00.640
<v Speaker 2>dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the original idea behind the EPA is a</v>

919
00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:01.980
<v Speaker 2>good one because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

920
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Congress is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not made up entirely of scientists,</v>

921
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:06.634
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly lawyers and lawyers aren't </v>

922
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:09.034
<v Speaker 2>environmental scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're going to need the </v>

923
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 2>testimony of environmental scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to need someone to actually go</v>

924
00:40:13.181 --> 00:40:14.014
<v Speaker 2>out and do the research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find the samples and prove perhaps that </v>

925
00:40:16.221 --> 00:40:19.870
<v Speaker 2>some company is putting too much mercury</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some sort of toxin into the,</v>

926
00:40:19.871 --> 00:40:20.704
<v Speaker 2>into the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to need science for that </v>

927
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.800
<v Speaker 2>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Be political though,</v>

928
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:24.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Be political.</v>

929
00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

930
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:26.800
<v Speaker 2>And not to be the enforcement arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

931
00:40:26.801 --> 00:40:27.634
<v Speaker 2>Because right now there are a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ventilated bureaucrats with assault </v>

932
00:40:29.351 --> 00:40:30.370
<v Speaker 2>rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

933
00:40:30.371 --> 00:40:33.310
<v Speaker 2>You've got the EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the US Department of Agriculture</v>

934
00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 2>has sub machine guns right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

935
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're checking the cows,</v>

936
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>

937
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:41.643
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to the FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think the FDA is an easier </v>

938
00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:47.860
<v Speaker 2>case to make for the case of abolishment</v>
<v Speaker 2>because even though people think,</v>

939
00:40:47.861 --> 00:40:49.390
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's the things that we eat all the</v>

940
00:40:49.391 --> 00:40:49.841
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

941
00:40:49.841 --> 00:40:50.641
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

942
00:40:50.641 --> 00:40:51.474
<v Speaker 2>And if you haven't noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are much more conscious about </v>

943
00:40:53.381 --> 00:40:55.510
<v Speaker 2>what they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

944
00:40:55.511 --> 00:40:57.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I look at yelp reviews,</v>

945
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.220
<v Speaker 2>perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you go and eat somewhere,</v>

946
00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:01.870
<v Speaker 2>I go and eat somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I've never been there before,</v>

947
00:41:01.871 --> 00:41:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I checked the opera and if they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dirty,</v>

948
00:41:04.151 --> 00:41:05.470
<v Speaker 2>it's got cockroaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

949
00:41:05.471 --> 00:41:07.090
<v Speaker 2>terrible service,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go there.</v>

950
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:08.320
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

951
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:11.260
<v Speaker 2>that's a market mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a regulation,</v>

952
00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:12.094
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a free market regulation that </v>

953
00:41:14.051 --> 00:41:17.200
<v Speaker 2>people use in order to determine whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not they should eat somewhere.</v>

954
00:41:17.201 --> 00:41:18.034
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take very long to figure out </v>

955
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.531
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

956
00:41:20.531 --> 00:41:22.420
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some food sources bad,</v>

957
00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:24.940
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when anybody makes a mistake,</v>

958
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:27.470
<v Speaker 2>which they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the government can't even stop some</v>

959
00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.313
<v Speaker 2>of Salmonella from getting out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens whenever somebody's child </v>

960
00:41:31.961 --> 00:41:33.100
<v Speaker 2>dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

961
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:33.981
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

962
00:41:33.981 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 2>one death is too many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's create an enormous,</v>

963
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.820
<v Speaker 2>a government institution for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>children and we'll save all the kitties.</v>

964
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:41.654
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you hate children and you want all </v>

965
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:44.594
<v Speaker 2>the children to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we have these </v>

966
00:41:46.611 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 2>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because as a politician,</v>

967
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:49.670
<v Speaker 2>it's so much easier to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

968
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:50.504
<v Speaker 2>I'm for the children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm for checking children's food and we </v>

969
00:41:52.881 --> 00:41:54.920
<v Speaker 2>don't want them putting poison and </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby's milk.</v>

970
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because yeah,</v>

971
00:41:56.091 --> 00:41:59.480
<v Speaker 2>because people really have an incentive </v>
<v Speaker 2>to poison right these milk,</v>

972
00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:00.314
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because actually if you are a good </v>

973
00:42:02.241 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 2>producer of food and you create clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy food,</v>

974
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.080
<v Speaker 2>you make more money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make more money,</v>

975
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.770
<v Speaker 2>whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are making much more than the lower</v>

976
00:42:09.771 --> 00:42:10.604
<v Speaker 2>end retail chains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just walk in there and hand them </v>

977
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:13.094
<v Speaker 2>all my cash because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not walking out of here with </v>

978
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:15.284
<v Speaker 2>any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It in some sense it's elitist and </v>

979
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.713
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what they'll do is the people </v>

980
00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:20.360
<v Speaker 2>who argue for it will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

981
00:42:20.361 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not worried about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

982
00:42:21.891 --> 00:42:22.641
<v Speaker 2>It's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

983
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm wealthy enough to check my food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have no problem with it.</v>

984
00:42:25.341 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Like if I had a private agency that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

985
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.290
<v Speaker 2>checking the food and had a stamp on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I would be fine,</v>

986
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:32.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's all the underclass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

987
00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Is the plebes that we need someone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of them.</v>

988
00:42:35.241 --> 00:42:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it becomes a very elitist thing that</v>

989
00:42:37.461 --> 00:42:39.350
<v Speaker 2>we need to have the government because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

990
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.413
<v Speaker 2>we need to have the really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really smart people like about 100 or </v>

991
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:46.670
<v Speaker 2>two to two to 300 of them sitting in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in a room making these decisions</v>

992
00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 2>for the Plebes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

993
00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what it comes down to is very</v>

994
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.880
<v Speaker 2>paternalistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought of it in,</v>

995
00:42:50.881 --> 00:42:51.714
<v Speaker 2>in the whole foods concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is something really there </v>

996
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:55.100
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to whole foods,</v>

997
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.880
<v Speaker 2>at least the one over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got,</v>

998
00:42:56.881 --> 00:42:57.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five levels of how they treat the </v>

999
00:42:58.881 --> 00:42:59.714
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the lowest is like free </v>

1000
00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:03.080
<v Speaker 2>range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is still pretty damn good.</v>

1001
00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:03.914
<v Speaker 2>The highest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they took them out to dinner </v>

1002
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:08.120
<v Speaker 2>before and they drug them and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounded weird.</v>

1003
00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.180
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all done by whole foods.</v>

1004
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.270
<v Speaker 2>It's by their policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1005
00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:13.791
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1006
00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:15.530
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they don't do it at Walmart,</v>

1007
00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:17.850
<v Speaker 2>you see the good and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>paternalistic cake like,</v>

1008
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 2>but they don't do that at Walmart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't shop at Walmart.</v>

1009
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:21.201
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1010
00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:22.370
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other people do.</v>

1011
00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 2>And I care about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1012
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:25.070
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't care about them.</v>

1013
00:43:25.071 --> 00:43:25.904
<v Speaker 2>You're not charitable because you go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take a gun and you put it to </v>

1014
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:31.100
<v Speaker 2>somebody's head and you say you will </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure this fluid is clean.</v>

1015
00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.210
<v Speaker 2>But is there any evidence of a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>where that was scale?</v>

1016
00:43:35.211 --> 00:43:40.211
<v Speaker 2>Like before the FDA existed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were there a lot of stores that were,</v>

1017
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:41.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people are intentionally </v>

1018
00:43:42.441 --> 00:43:44.750
<v Speaker 2>poisoning tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little grocer,</v>

1019
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:48.350
<v Speaker 2>but is there any evidence that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it actually accomplished anything?</v>

1020
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:49.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1021
00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>

1022
00:43:51.031 --> 00:43:53.030
<v Speaker 2>is that it's all about the incentives.</v>

1023
00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1024
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.333
<v Speaker 2>so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that people are </v>

1025
00:43:55.491 --> 00:43:58.790
<v Speaker 2>incentivized to actually do good by </v>
<v Speaker 2>their community?</v>

1026
00:43:58.791 --> 00:44:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Because the way that capitalism works as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better you serve your community,</v>

1027
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.070
<v Speaker 2>the more they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more money you make.</v>

1028
00:44:04.071 --> 00:44:04.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1029
00:44:04.701 --> 00:44:05.840
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1030
00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:06.310
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1031
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.210
<v Speaker 2>and there are always examples of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1032
00:44:08.211 --> 00:44:10.880
<v Speaker 2>just like there have been financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>panics before the Federal Reserve,</v>

1033
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.030
<v Speaker 2>but somehow instead of having great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1034
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.440
<v Speaker 2>instead of having great depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we did post fed,</v>

1035
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:19.190
<v Speaker 2>we have these little short term blips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little panics that happened in a year.</v>

1036
00:44:19.191 --> 00:44:20.024
<v Speaker 2>It cleans itself out and it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now what we do is government steps </v>

1037
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:24.640
<v Speaker 2>in and any prolonged crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1038
00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:25.943
<v Speaker 2>And exacerbates crisis because then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have tax payer money spent on </v>

1039
00:44:29.241 --> 00:44:30.021
<v Speaker 2>the cleanup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1040
00:44:30.021 --> 00:44:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Whereas before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was like a food poisoning case,</v>

1041
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:34.074
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a local judge would have a judgment and </v>

1042
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

1043
00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:38.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact,</v>

1044
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribute and they would bring it back to,</v>

1045
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1046
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:42.140
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1047
00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.840
<v Speaker 2>the victims were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1048
00:44:43.841 --> 00:44:45.630
<v Speaker 2>and there would be just compensation for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1049
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.380
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes down to the question of,</v>

1050
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.970
<v Speaker 2>of whether or not you think that some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1051
00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:51.893
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy in Washington DC </v>
<v Speaker 2>consensually plan all of the food and </v>

1052
00:44:56.641 --> 00:45:00.360
<v Speaker 2>all of the drugs everybody takes in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

1053
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Hubris to assume that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are smart,</v>

1054
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.431
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>

1055
00:45:05.431 --> 00:45:07.080
<v Speaker 2>you can get the best people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1056
00:45:07.081 --> 00:45:07.914
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and put them in a little room and </v>

1057
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Speaker 2>hopefully you're going to get some good </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

1058
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:11.880
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more often than not,</v>

1059
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:13.520
<v Speaker 2>it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1060
00:45:13.521 --> 00:45:16.590
<v Speaker 2>it's Hubris because they think that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can possibly play all of our allies.</v>

1061
00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:18.970
<v Speaker 2>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The definition of socialism is,</v>

1062
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:22.780
<v Speaker 2>is central planning central control over</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives,</v>

1063
00:45:22.781 --> 00:45:24.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety percent income tax rate.</v>

1064
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.850
<v Speaker 2>You have no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The state plans,</v>

1065
00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:27.684
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really the road to serfdom </v>

1066
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.210
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1067
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:33.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a freedom is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freedom is dangerous as hell,</v>

1068
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'll take her to stop poisoning our </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes.</v>

1069
00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.370
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1070
00:45:38.371 --> 00:45:40.020
<v Speaker 2>with all this inspector stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1071
00:45:40.021 --> 00:45:42.690
<v Speaker 2>first off you can pay off and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspector very easily.</v>

1072
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.793
<v Speaker 2>There's so many little ways around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It reminds me a little bit when like </v>

1073
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.493
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid and I went to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>away camp and the date and the camp </v>

1074
00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:49.614
<v Speaker 2>would be like a disaster for three weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were like swimming in sewage the </v>

1075
00:45:52.471 --> 00:45:54.300
<v Speaker 2>day before visiting day when the parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>are coming.</v>

1076
00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:55.780
<v Speaker 2>They cleaned up the whole freaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1077
00:45:55.781 --> 00:45:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it looks good.</v>

1078
00:45:56.911 --> 00:45:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Parents come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're happy,</v>

1079
00:45:57.931 --> 00:45:59.070
<v Speaker 2>and then they leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

1080
00:45:59.071 --> 00:46:01.640
<v Speaker 2>next day we have license,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1081
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:02.663
<v Speaker 2>But the difference between a private </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspector and a state inspector is that </v>

1082
00:46:05.041 --> 00:46:07.440
<v Speaker 2>if the at both both have a tendency to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be corrupt,</v>

1083
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.330
<v Speaker 2>but you can't fire the state inspector.</v>

1084
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.610
<v Speaker 2>It was going to take an election or it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to take,</v>

1085
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some connections in DC.</v>

1086
00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you've got a private inspector,</v>

1087
00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:17.210
<v Speaker 2>then they are much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1088
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.640
<v Speaker 2>they are much more tied to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities and uh,</v>

1089
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:22.140
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fire them,</v>

1090
00:46:22.141 --> 00:46:23.850
<v Speaker 2>you can prosecute them and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government will,</v>

1091
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I will guarantee you he's going to step </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and clamped down on that.</v>

1092
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:29.160
<v Speaker 2>But if it's the government and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to sue the state,</v>

1093
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.830
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You briefly mentioned taxes,</v>

1094
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taxes is taxation theft.</v>

1095
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.410
<v Speaker 2>It's more like extortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1096
00:46:37.411 --> 00:46:38.244
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't make for as fun a slogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel that I have a great hat </v>

1097
00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:43.260
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I sell.</v>

1098
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.950
<v Speaker 2>It says make taxation theft again </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of make America great again.</v>

1099
00:46:46.951 --> 00:46:47.784
<v Speaker 2>And that goes really well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want to wear it in </v>

1100
00:46:49.021 --> 00:46:51.450
<v Speaker 2>California because I thought they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it was a trump hat and I might get</v>

1101
00:46:51.451 --> 00:46:53.430
<v Speaker 2>beat up even if you just wear a red hat.</v>

1102
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.690
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see this?</v>

1103
00:46:54.691 --> 00:46:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I had a guy that hated abby a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago that he wore.</v>

1104
00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:00.780
<v Speaker 2>He was wearing a nintendo switch hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nude Nintendo and it's a red hat.</v>

1105
00:47:00.781 --> 00:47:02.580
<v Speaker 2>And he said people were telling him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go fuck himself.</v>

1106
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1107
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.793
<v Speaker 2>Well and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody got beat up and I'm in DC </v>

1108
00:47:06.721 --> 00:47:08.730
<v Speaker 2>because it said a make bitcoin great </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1109
00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:12.240
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left has gone a little bit nuts,</v>

1110
00:47:12.241 --> 00:47:13.074
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you've started to detail on some of </v>

1111
00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:15.860
<v Speaker 2>your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1112
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.033
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tax or the price we pay to live in a </v>

1113
00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:21.720
<v Speaker 2>civilized society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kidding.</v>

1114
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1115
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.170
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went to the camera,</v>

1116
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:26.930
<v Speaker 2>triggered all the libertarians are </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>

1117
00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1118
00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.270
<v Speaker 2>taxes should be as low as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1119
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.350
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that you should keep the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit of your labor.</v>

1120
00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 2>That's the philosophical argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1121
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.980
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technical argument is,</v>

1122
00:47:35.981 --> 00:47:38.230
<v Speaker 2>is the government wastes so much money.</v>

1123
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.480
<v Speaker 2>They wasted money because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an incentive.</v>

1124
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an incentive to save money,</v>

1125
00:47:42.971 --> 00:47:45.250
<v Speaker 2>but if we go out to dinner tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

1126
00:47:45.251 --> 00:47:48.430
<v Speaker 2>and you're like Austin and I'm taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the finest restaurant in Los Angeles,</v>

1127
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll be alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1128
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:54.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting steak and lobster shrimp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get all the fixings.</v>

1129
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.433
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's no incentive for </v>

1130
00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 2>government officials to save.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no,</v>

1131
00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.373
<v Speaker 2>there's no incentive for them to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>careful stewards of the public's money </v>

1132
00:48:02.261 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 2>in our trust and they build these </v>
<v Speaker 2>budgets that they have to exceed.</v>

1133
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise their budgets get slashed </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people,</v>

1134
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.190
<v Speaker 2>they didn't use the mic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it in and out,</v>

1135
00:48:09.191 --> 00:48:12.940
<v Speaker 2>but that's really all in and out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret menu though.</v>

1136
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:15.670
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to taxes,</v>

1137
00:48:15.671 --> 00:48:16.504
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of the income tax just </v>

1138
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:20.980
<v Speaker 2>because it assumes that the money isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>yours.</v>

1139
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1140
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.200
<v Speaker 2>It basically assumes that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1141
00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:24.034
<v Speaker 2>this is our money and we're going to let</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some of it as soon as we've </v>

1142
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:27.850
<v Speaker 2>taken out our share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1143
00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Withholding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1144
00:48:29.271 --> 00:48:30.760
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a philosophical perspective,</v>

1145
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:31.594
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just anathema to the </v>

1146
00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:36.370
<v Speaker 2>concept of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have it before 19,</v>

1147
00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:38.350
<v Speaker 2>13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow the roads got built,</v>

1148
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 2>the roads did get built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

1149
00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.750
<v Speaker 2>We had systems tariffs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1150
00:48:41.751 --> 00:48:43.700
<v Speaker 2>But at least with a tariff system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not a fan,</v>

1151
00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of tariffs either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with a tariff system,</v>

1152
00:48:46.271 --> 00:48:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're in a sense you're paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what you use,</v>

1153
00:48:48.641 --> 00:48:50.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like Gary Johnson's,</v>

1154
00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>national sales tax proposal.</v>

1155
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Right now you're just paying for what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you use,</v>

1156
00:48:54.521 --> 00:48:57.460
<v Speaker 2>what you consume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I think in some ways as a,</v>

1157
00:48:57.461 --> 00:49:00.160
<v Speaker 2>from a moral perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's better than an income tax,</v>

1158
00:49:00.161 --> 00:49:00.731
<v Speaker 2>which just says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1159
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:03.820
<v Speaker 2>what you have is ours and we'll let you </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep a little bit,</v>

1160
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:04.683
<v Speaker 2>little part of it.</v>

1161
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:08.830
<v Speaker 2>I prefer a flat tax system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's controversial because poor</v>

1162
00:49:08.831 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 2>people pay a larger percentage of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>goods and services,</v>

1163
00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:13.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1164
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.353
<v Speaker 2>of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their money into essential goods and </v>

1165
00:49:16.361 --> 00:49:17.280
<v Speaker 2>services.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1166
00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:20.090
<v Speaker 2>so there is a problem with that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say that's regressive and that,</v>

1167
00:49:20.091 --> 00:49:21.520
<v Speaker 2>and that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I acknowledged that.</v>

1168
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:24.220
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really believe in true equality,</v>

1169
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 2>which we hear a lot from progresses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1170
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.513
<v Speaker 2>if we all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we want people to be equal in some </v>

1171
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:31.960
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then shouldn't they be taxed at an equal</v>

1172
00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:32.990
<v Speaker 2>rate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1173
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.470
<v Speaker 2>the then they disagree and they say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you make more,</v>

1174
00:49:35.471 --> 00:49:36.304
<v Speaker 2>you should have to pay more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that creates big word </v>

1175
00:49:39.311 --> 00:49:40.144
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disequilibrium in the sense because </v>

1176
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.060
<v Speaker 2>because the people who are the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive are,</v>

1177
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:47.680
<v Speaker 2>are being harnessed the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1178
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:48.663
<v Speaker 2>And the people who are the least </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive in some sense are paying </v>

1179
00:49:51.191 --> 00:49:52.000
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1180
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.890
<v Speaker 2>So if we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not to say that it should,</v>

1181
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.311
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>

1182
00:49:54.311 --> 00:49:55.270
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's moral here,</v>

1183
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:56.283
<v Speaker 2>but in some sense you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking the people who are </v>

1184
00:49:58.061 --> 00:50:02.070
<v Speaker 2>creating all of the wealth of society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the Randy and concept of,</v>

1185
00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:02.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here is that you're taking all those </v>

1186
00:50:03.761 --> 00:50:07.690
<v Speaker 2>people and you're disincentivizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cream of society.</v>

1187
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.360
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that that's not the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to go about it.</v>

1188
00:50:10.361 --> 00:50:11.194
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody should be taxed at the same </v>

1189
00:50:12.011 --> 00:50:13.330
<v Speaker 2>rate for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be taxed at all.</v>

1190
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most of the taxes that we have,</v>

1191
00:50:15.551 --> 00:50:15.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1192
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.590
<v Speaker 2>I think are just excessive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1193
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:18.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1194
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.600
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the income taxes,</v>

1195
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:22.050
<v Speaker 2>sales taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>property taxes,</v>

1196
00:50:22.051 --> 00:50:24.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got fines and fees everywhere you</v>

1197
00:50:24.701 --> 00:50:25.481
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me,</v>

1198
00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm a business owner now and I just did </v>
<v Speaker 2>my taxes this week.</v>

1199
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:28.874
<v Speaker 2>I know about a whole new slew of taxes I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know about for the privilege of </v>

1200
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:33.740
<v Speaker 2>sitting in your home during this </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview.</v>

1201
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:35.870
<v Speaker 2>You have the government 15 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1202
00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.120
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1203
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:38.083
<v Speaker 2>so alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you mentioned a flat tax and when </v>

1204
00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:41.760
<v Speaker 2>people asked me about taxes and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1205
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I've said for awhile as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a liberal,</v>

1206
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I haven't moved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1207
00:50:45.031 --> 00:50:45.864
<v Speaker 2>I've watched the left go off the deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>end so it makes it seem like I'm more </v>

1208
00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:51.080
<v Speaker 2>right even though I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've moved,</v>

1209
00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:51.914
<v Speaker 2>but I think I've shifted a little bit on</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes which is I would basically be for </v>

1210
00:50:56.151 --> 00:50:56.984
<v Speaker 2>some sort of flat tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna pick a number for a </v>

1211
00:50:59.121 --> 00:51:03.110
<v Speaker 2>second and we can go backward and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say 15 percent flat tax and if you</v>

1212
00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:03.953
<v Speaker 2>made less than 50 grand you don't pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>any taxes because you need the help the </v>

1213
00:51:07.521 --> 00:51:11.540
<v Speaker 2>most and if you make over 10 million or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like I would pick at something</v>

1214
00:51:11.541 --> 00:51:12.374
<v Speaker 2>pretty high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pay another two percent and then </v>

1215
00:51:14.121 --> 00:51:16.040
<v Speaker 2>maybe over $100 million to pay another </v>
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>

1216
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.640
<v Speaker 2>But something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does something like that make some sense</v>

1217
00:51:19.641 --> 00:51:20.421
<v Speaker 2>to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:51:20.421 --> 00:51:24.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean for any reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tax system that we have,</v>

1219
00:51:24.141 --> 00:51:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I can be reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1220
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I may not like taxes at all right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1221
00:51:27.691 --> 00:51:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I just shout it from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a just a simple like,</v>

1222
00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction,</v>

1223
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.150
<v Speaker 2>I just despise taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1224
00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:37.560
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's time for us to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of reasonable tax reform.</v>

1225
00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:38.241
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1226
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:39.074
<v Speaker 2>I think that these kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the kind of solution that I was </v>

1227
00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:42.140
<v Speaker 2>looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is,</v>

1228
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:45.620
<v Speaker 2>isn't with taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth spending because the spending</v>

1229
00:51:45.621 --> 00:51:47.910
<v Speaker 2>is just future taxes and we've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves to what,</v>

1230
00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.520
<v Speaker 2>$20,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>in debt.</v>

1231
00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:52.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every the Conservatives and,</v>

1232
00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.043
<v Speaker 2>and what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats were attacking the </v>

1233
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.573
<v Speaker 2>conservatives in the Republican party </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Ronald Reagan drove up our </v>

1234
00:51:58.131 --> 00:52:00.760
<v Speaker 2>national debt to $144,000,000,000.</v>

1235
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:03.440
<v Speaker 2>What is it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 20 trillion,</v>

1236
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.053
<v Speaker 2>$144 million versus $20,000,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've gone into the twilight zone in </v>

1237
00:52:10.881 --> 00:52:14.900
<v Speaker 2>some sense in terms of our spending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we take into trillion a year.</v>

1238
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:18.260
<v Speaker 2>We spent 4 trillion a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me is a,</v>

1239
00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 2>is a recipe for disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems fairly obvious to me,</v>

1240
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:22.874
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not an economist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're never going to pay this money </v>

1241
00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:26.390
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems obvious to me.</v>

1242
00:52:26.391 --> 00:52:27.224
<v Speaker 2>And that then unfortunately creates a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where it's why we need a </v>

1243
00:52:31.461 --> 00:52:33.120
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1244
00:52:33.121 --> 00:52:35.180
<v Speaker 2>That one day trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1245
00:52:35.181 --> 00:52:35.671
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1246
00:52:35.671 --> 00:52:36.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

1247
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:39.710
<v Speaker 2>that just seems real world to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One day it's possible.</v>

1248
00:52:39.711 --> 00:52:40.880
<v Speaker 2>China is going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1249
00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:43.190
<v Speaker 2>you guys are racked up quite a bill over</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1250
00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do about that?</v>

1251
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.393
<v Speaker 2>And then unfortunately we know we're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna pay it back because we don't have </v>

1252
00:52:49.401 --> 00:52:50.234
<v Speaker 2>the money.</v>

1253
00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:52.190
<v Speaker 2>And that's how you ended up in another </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

1254
00:52:52.191 --> 00:52:56.130
<v Speaker 2>So in a bizarre way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a debt brings war.</v>

1255
00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1256
00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:00.350
<v Speaker 2>the United States is defaulted before </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it didn't go to war.</v>

1257
00:53:00.351 --> 00:53:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1258
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.680
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bretton Woods,</v>

1259
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.693
<v Speaker 2>a crisis of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we had where we finally closed the </v>

1260
00:53:07.221 --> 00:53:11.870
<v Speaker 2>gold window or no longer could you trade</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars for gold internationally.</v>

1261
00:53:11.871 --> 00:53:14.630
<v Speaker 2>And then we did it nationally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in many ways,</v>

1262
00:53:14.631 --> 00:53:15.464
<v Speaker 2>this is a default because in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're destroying the savings of people </v>

1263
00:53:18.351 --> 00:53:21.650
<v Speaker 2>who had money back to buy gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so these are,</v>

1264
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.490
<v Speaker 2>these are defaults in a sense and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

1265
00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:25.300
<v Speaker 2>it didn't cause war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in mean our,</v>

1266
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:29.220
<v Speaker 2>our creditors overseas who wanted to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to exchange their dollars for gold,</v>

1267
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:30.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't attack us.</v>

1268
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.790
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know that it necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs it.</v>

1269
00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:36.630
<v Speaker 2>It would necessarily lead to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we had a default in some sense.</v>

1270
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:37.950
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1271
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:39.211
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1272
00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:41.640
<v Speaker 2>it's only $20,000,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1273
00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:43.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$100,000,000,000,000</v>

1274
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:46.770
<v Speaker 2>in the United States economy that we put</v>
<v Speaker 2>out $2,000,000,000,000</v>

1275
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:48.570
<v Speaker 2>a year or two to $2,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

1276
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:52.050
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't take that long for us to pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>it off if we would cut spending.</v>

1277
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.183
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that it's not feasible to </v>

1278
00:53:54.451 --> 00:53:58.260
<v Speaker 2>cut taxes because I think everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to cut taxes and everybody,</v>

1279
00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.880
<v Speaker 2>if you ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>

1280
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.980
<v Speaker 2>can I pay a lower tax for the sandwich?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1281
00:54:01.981 --> 00:54:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1282
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.260
<v Speaker 2>everyone says they'd like to cut them </v>
<v Speaker 2>for themselves,</v>

1283
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 2>but there's plenty of people that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say I'd like them to be higher for sure.</v>

1284
00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:08.643
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we could get some sort of broad </v>

1285
00:54:09.361 --> 00:54:10.194
<v Speaker 2>based tax form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say we do stocking to solve the </v>

1286
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.414
<v Speaker 2>problem because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any spending is just a future tax </v>

1287
00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:15.384
<v Speaker 2>increase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we could cut spending and then </v>

1288
00:54:17.611 --> 00:54:18.444
<v Speaker 2>there are some proposals that have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>put out and I put one out in my </v>

1289
00:54:20.821 --> 00:54:23.700
<v Speaker 2>presidential campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we called it the penny plan where rather</v>

1290
00:54:23.701 --> 00:54:26.230
<v Speaker 2>than try and kill elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1291
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.180
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some special interests,</v>

1292
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:28.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1293
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.050
<v Speaker 2>You just make everybody take a haircut </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the top.</v>

1294
00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:34.740
<v Speaker 2>And it was called the penny plan because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd cut one penny out of every federal</v>

1295
00:54:34.741 --> 00:54:36.630
<v Speaker 2>dollar across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1296
00:54:36.631 --> 00:54:38.510
<v Speaker 2>And then you would put in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1297
00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:39.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cap,</v>

1298
00:54:39.291 --> 00:54:41.970
<v Speaker 2>a spending cap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like 15 percent of GDP,</v>

1299
00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:42.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that you wouldn't,</v>

1300
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:46.590
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't spend yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 2>oblivion in the future.</v>

1301
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.633
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that if you just give </v>

1302
00:54:49.081 --> 00:54:49.914
<v Speaker 2>everybody a little haircut across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top and then you continue to do that </v>

1303
00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:53.394
<v Speaker 2>every year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those savings start to add up and I </v>

1304
00:54:55.801 --> 00:54:59.580
<v Speaker 2>think that that's a reasonable way to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it rather than inflame some,</v>

1305
00:54:59.581 --> 00:55:00.414
<v Speaker 2>the passions of the people who love pbs </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the National Park Service and things </v>

1306
00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:04.734
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If everybody has to take the same </v>

1307
00:55:05.311 --> 00:55:07.260
<v Speaker 2>haircut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like if we're all taxed the same.</v>

1308
00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:08.094
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really a quality in a </v>

1309
00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:09.580
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

1310
00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1311
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:11.334
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily politically </v>

1312
00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:13.720
<v Speaker 2>feasible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but new ideas got to get them out.</v>

1313
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So That's interesting.</v>

1314
00:55:14.671 --> 00:55:15.504
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually consistent with what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said earlier about sort of </v>

1315
00:55:17.401 --> 00:55:18.234
<v Speaker 2>incremental things or how you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>change things without burning down the </v>

1316
00:55:21.091 --> 00:55:22.170
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in this case,</v>

1317
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:26.340
<v Speaker 2>you're not taken big bird out to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shed and shooting him,</v>

1318
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:31.080
<v Speaker 2>but I would get a lot more facebook fans</v>
<v Speaker 2>by said that would be a lot more popular</v>

1319
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:32.830
<v Speaker 2>because you know it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

1320
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.320
<v Speaker 2>we could get in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll just tell you,</v>

1321
00:55:34.321 --> 00:55:36.810
<v Speaker 2>it's so polarized right now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1322
00:55:36.811 --> 00:55:38.790
<v Speaker 2>if you're not with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're against us.</v>

1323
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:40.590
<v Speaker 2>If you're not a feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a bigot.</v>

1324
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.300
<v Speaker 2>If you're not a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're a stupid lip toward and,</v>

1325
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.530
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to be.</v>

1326
00:55:46.531 --> 00:55:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1327
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1328
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:52.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm a radical competitive admissions but</v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst,</v>

1329
00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.720
<v Speaker 2>but in the political world of today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1330
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I bore people because I come up </v>

1331
00:55:57.031 --> 00:55:59.460
<v Speaker 2>with such simple solutions and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1332
00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:01.490
<v Speaker 2>this is a path towards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1333
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:02.993
<v Speaker 2>towards what we really want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Progressives can get on board some </v>

1334
00:56:05.461 --> 00:56:06.241
<v Speaker 2>of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1335
00:56:06.241 --> 00:56:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Gay Marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1336
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:08.003
<v Speaker 2>liberal Liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats can get onboard those people </v>

1337
00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.050
<v Speaker 2>who even like Hillary or Bernie can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this.</v>

1338
00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:14.700
<v Speaker 2>And people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Gary or whatever,</v>

1339
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.653
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are all sorts of solutions that I </v>

1340
00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:19.590
<v Speaker 2>think has a broad base of support </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst the American people.</v>

1341
00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 2>The people who control our politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1342
00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:22.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1343
00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:23.453
<v Speaker 2>on left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right are so toxic that he poisoned the </v>

1344
00:56:25.871 --> 00:56:26.704
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why obamacare wasn't </v>

1345
00:56:28.421 --> 00:56:29.254
<v Speaker 2>overturned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not because the house freedom radicals </v>

1346
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:31.984
<v Speaker 2>were in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because the people who were in the </v>

1347
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:34.390
<v Speaker 2>establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1348
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 2>we're slapping it together and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1349
00:56:36.641 --> 00:56:37.474
<v Speaker 2>in some sense they were the radicals </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were doubling down on </v>

1350
00:56:39.311 --> 00:56:40.144
<v Speaker 2>obamacare in many ways and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to demonize the opposition within </v>

1351
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:45.790
<v Speaker 2>their own party and the Democrats are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just loving it.</v>

1352
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:46.631
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1353
00:56:46.631 --> 00:56:48.250
<v Speaker 2>but the Democrats have their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems too.</v>

1354
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:48.791
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1355
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:50.260
<v Speaker 2>So let's throw away some easy ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1356
00:56:50.261 --> 00:56:52.550
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana and legalizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana altogether.</v>

1357
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.270
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1358
00:56:54.271 --> 00:56:56.710
<v Speaker 2>About the problem with legalizing it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you got to pay taxes.</v>

1359
00:56:56.711 --> 00:56:57.251
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1360
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1361
00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:00.250
<v Speaker 2>decriminalizing is where the anarchist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1362
00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:01.660
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take legalization over.</v>

1363
00:57:01.661 --> 00:57:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

1364
00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.850
<v Speaker 2>we'll throw that one away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gay Marriage,</v>

1365
00:57:03.851 --> 00:57:04.630
<v Speaker 2>not a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1366
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Two people want to do what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

1367
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I talk about that for a second?</v>

1368
00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Let me just say that I just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give you some easy ones to just love it.</v>

1369
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:14.770
<v Speaker 2>But I am so happy whenever anybody finds</v>
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>

1370
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:15.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1371
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.860
<v Speaker 2>and it's just not set enough by people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1372
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:18.873
<v Speaker 2>what the hell business is it if somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else else's happy that the government </v>

1373
00:57:21.611 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 2>should get involved in a contract </v>
<v Speaker 2>between two consenting adults?</v>

1374
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1375
00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:25.800
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1376
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I never understood like I've seen on </v>
<v Speaker 2>some level where some people,</v>

1377
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find discussed with it.</v>

1378
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just never felt that way.</v>

1379
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1380
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.640
<v Speaker 2>I have just way too many gay friends and</v>
<v Speaker 2>family members that,</v>

1381
00:57:36.641 --> 00:57:37.474
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've grown up around that I love </v>

1382
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:41.680
<v Speaker 2>like crazy and I want them to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

1383
00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:44.260
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a gay marriage question.</v>

1384
00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:47.020
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So does the state have have a prevailing</v>

1385
00:57:47.021 --> 00:57:47.854
<v Speaker 2>interest and telling people that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't sign a contract and that's how I </v>

1386
00:57:50.201 --> 00:57:50.951
<v Speaker 2>feel about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1387
00:57:50.951 --> 00:57:51.784
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I've used that one as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a consistent example of where </v>

1388
00:57:54.311 --> 00:57:56.680
<v Speaker 2>liberals and Libertarians can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

1389
00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:57.514
<v Speaker 2>so you may be a liberal who just feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is the right thing to do and </v>

1390
00:58:01.001 --> 00:58:01.834
<v Speaker 2>the liberal thing to do and you may be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian even though you said Nice </v>

1391
00:58:04.121 --> 00:58:06.130
<v Speaker 2>things about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about gay people and whatever,</v>

1392
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.240
<v Speaker 2>but you may just be a libertarian.</v>

1393
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.073
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want the government like </v>

1394
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:10.053
<v Speaker 2>this now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives and Alabama or pushing a </v>

1395
00:58:11.771 --> 00:58:12.604
<v Speaker 2>bill to get the state out of marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they're doing it because they are </v>

1396
00:58:16.331 --> 00:58:19.030
<v Speaker 2>absolutely tired of the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>stepping in and saying,</v>

1397
00:58:19.031 --> 00:58:19.864
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're forcing you to recognize gay </v>

1398
00:58:20.771 --> 00:58:21.604
<v Speaker 2>marriages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1399
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.510
<v Speaker 2>And so we may actually get a consensus </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this because the conservatives are so</v>

1400
00:58:25.511 --> 00:58:28.030
<v Speaker 2>tired of losing these culture wars and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1401
00:58:28.031 --> 00:58:29.530
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats love winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1402
00:58:29.531 --> 00:58:31.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that if we,</v>

1403
00:58:31.451 --> 00:58:35.190
<v Speaker 2>if we could get a consensus for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately now because of the,</v>

1404
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.690
<v Speaker 2>the overfelt case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I still support,</v>

1405
00:58:37.691 --> 00:58:40.480
<v Speaker 2>but because of the overfill case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now a federal issue,</v>

1406
00:58:40.481 --> 00:58:41.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like abortion.</v>

1407
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:44.920
<v Speaker 2>We just can't go back to a state based </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution on this,</v>

1408
00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:45.754
<v Speaker 2>but if we can get people to accept an </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea first that then we can start </v>

1409
00:58:48.671 --> 00:58:49.720
<v Speaker 2>talking about putting it action.</v>

1410
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:50.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suspect as with abortion it's </v>

1411
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:53.890
<v Speaker 2>going to just stay the way it is and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think,</v>

1412
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.980
<v Speaker 2>but that remains to be seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh.</v>

1413
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.823
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I gave you two basically is the only </v>

1414
00:58:57.611 --> 00:58:59.950
<v Speaker 2>thing that we'll do to tougher ones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've sort of touched on here.</v>

1415
00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:01.053
<v Speaker 2>A second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So obviously I know you are a strong </v>

1416
00:59:02.921 --> 00:59:06.820
<v Speaker 2>supporter of the second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there any regulations that we should</v>

1417
00:59:06.821 --> 00:59:08.020
<v Speaker 2>have on gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1418
00:59:08.021 --> 00:59:08.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe nukes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1419
00:59:08.891 --> 00:59:11.410
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you shouldn't be able to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapon,</v>

1420
00:59:11.411 --> 00:59:11.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1421
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:12.401
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to.</v>

1422
00:59:12.401 --> 00:59:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Kim Jong Moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1423
00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:15.580
<v Speaker 2>That might be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tipping point.</v>

1424
00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nukes for the most part.</v>

1425
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:20.650
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that most people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you,</v>

1426
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.990
<v Speaker 2>if you make it legal to own tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then like everybody's gonna own tanks.</v>

1427
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Well it's not true because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive to own a tank.</v>

1428
00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even drive it down the 10 feet</v>

1429
00:59:29.841 --> 00:59:30.674
<v Speaker 2>without the gasoline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the insane gasoline bill that it would </v>

1430
00:59:32.631 --> 00:59:33.464
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was probably probably be illegal </v>

1431
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.680
<v Speaker 2>to drive that on the road too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1432
00:59:36.681 --> 00:59:37.514
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't have to worry that people </v>

1433
00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:39.644
<v Speaker 2>are going to suddenly come out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>tanks and this is going to make some </v>

1434
00:59:42.021 --> 00:59:42.854
<v Speaker 2>people uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really need to understand that </v>

1435
00:59:45.561 --> 00:59:48.750
<v Speaker 2>the revolution was fought by in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways by militia men.</v>

1436
00:59:48.810 --> 00:59:49.643
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fought with military grade weapons </v>

1437
00:59:51.351 --> 00:59:52.184
<v Speaker 2>of their time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I worry about disarming the </v>

1438
00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 2>citizenry one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1439
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.313
<v Speaker 2>liberals are now arming up by ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>irony now the liberals all are talking </v>

1440
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:06.150
<v Speaker 2>about limits on executive power because </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is in power and create,</v>

1441
01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:07.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of their screams of misogynists and </v>

1442
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.590
<v Speaker 2>racists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now they're like,</v>

1443
01:00:09.591 --> 01:00:10.850
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we need to do about it.</v>

1444
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:11.683
<v Speaker 2>Something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One day they're talking about states </v>

1445
01:00:12.771 --> 01:00:14.300
<v Speaker 2>rights because the sanctuary cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1446
01:00:14.301 --> 01:00:15.610
<v Speaker 2>everything's upside down now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1447
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:16.351
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1448
01:00:16.351 --> 01:00:17.184
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there is some irony there in </v>

1449
01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:19.101
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>

1450
01:00:19.101 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 2>if they agree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1451
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.960
<v Speaker 2>I saw some liberals were out like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1452
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:24.680
<v Speaker 2>doing a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gun march the other day,</v>

1453
01:00:24.681 --> 01:00:26.780
<v Speaker 2>but then when we look closer they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying airsoft.</v>

1454
01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.140
<v Speaker 2>You guys might want to get some actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some actual guns,</v>

1455
01:00:30.141 --> 01:00:35.141
<v Speaker 2>but yet strong from support of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Second Amendment says arms for a reason.</v>

1456
01:00:35.571 --> 01:00:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a bit of,</v>

1457
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to use the ideas is that,</v>

1458
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:40.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the arms,</v>

1459
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:42.580
<v Speaker 2>the definition of that would change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1460
01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:43.533
<v Speaker 2>so I do think that citizens should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to have that fully automatic </v>

1461
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.970
<v Speaker 2>rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to live in a world where gay</v>

1462
01:00:46.971 --> 01:00:48.890
<v Speaker 2>married couples can defend their </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana fields,</v>

1463
01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.810
<v Speaker 2>fully automatic machine guns.</v>

1464
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:52.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

1465
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.593
<v Speaker 2>You're giving me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're happily married lesbians who </v>

1466
01:00:56.511 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 2>grow marijuana and one day somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes in and wants to steal their stash.</v>

1467
01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:00.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do,</v>

1468
01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:02.930
<v Speaker 2>they should be able to grab their ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1469
01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.070
<v Speaker 2>kick some ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1470
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.600
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like that should be on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix,</v>

1471
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.330
<v Speaker 2>that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1472
01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somebody's gonna hear that and go,</v>

1473
01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:10.664
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been with this guy is making some </v>

1474
01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:12.494
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want my neighbor walking </v>

1475
01:01:13.371 --> 01:01:15.920
<v Speaker 2>around with a bazooka.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tank is obviously okay.</v>

1476
01:01:15.921 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 2>You can't afford a tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe a save 20 grand.</v>

1477
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:19.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you'd call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1478
01:01:19.821 --> 01:01:23.030
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you stop the crazy person from</v>

1479
01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:26.060
<v Speaker 2>just saving all their money and buying a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapon that they could blow up at school</v>

1480
01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:26.300
<v Speaker 2>or.</v>

1481
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.133
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could tell you could get on the </v>

1482
01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Internet and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1483
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:29.953
<v Speaker 2>you could build a bazooka for a lot less</v>
<v Speaker 2>than it costs to buy one because that's </v>

1484
01:01:33.921 --> 01:01:35.120
<v Speaker 2>probably not the answer they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1485
01:01:35.121 --> 01:01:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the problem is,</v>

1486
01:01:37.121 --> 01:01:39.380
<v Speaker 2>is that people who want to do evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are going to do it,</v>

1487
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:39.921
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1488
01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:42.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to make a gun,</v>

1489
01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take a pipe,</v>

1490
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.620
<v Speaker 2>put a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a shotgun shell in it,</v>

1491
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.480
<v Speaker 2>hit it with a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a gun.</v>

1492
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.440
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1493
01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.580
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1494
01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say that,</v>

1495
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:53.180
<v Speaker 2>oh well we don't ban it ban something </v>
<v Speaker 2>simply because,</v>

1496
01:01:53.181 --> 01:01:53.950
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1497
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:55.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible to do it right.</v>

1498
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:57.500
<v Speaker 2>We banned murderer for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for good reasons.</v>

1499
01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a gun is a tool,</v>

1500
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a tool and it's just,</v>

1501
01:02:01.611 --> 01:02:04.250
<v Speaker 2>it's only as evil as the person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>wields it.</v>

1502
01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.253
<v Speaker 2>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an object in itself doesn't carry any </v>

1503
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:09.430
<v Speaker 2>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1504
01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:09.980
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1505
01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:10.813
<v Speaker 2>sometimes libertarians would get upset </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me because I talk about drones for </v>

1506
01:02:12.921 --> 01:02:13.731
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>

1507
01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:15.740
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a drone is again,</v>

1508
01:02:15.741 --> 01:02:17.180
<v Speaker 2>just a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1509
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:18.043
<v Speaker 2>it's just like any other tool and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what matters is that constitutional due </v>

1510
01:02:21.381 --> 01:02:24.870
<v Speaker 2>process is applied when the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses a tool like this,</v>

1511
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:25.733
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We like drones much better than we like </v>

1512
01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.280
<v Speaker 2>carpet bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1513
01:02:29.281 --> 01:02:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Because it's been more pinpointed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1514
01:02:31.351 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 2>But the ultimate question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is who wields the gun?</v>

1515
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Who Will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has power to do it?</v>

1516
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.773
<v Speaker 2>The finding is about liberals that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of kills me are the ones who are the </v>

1517
01:02:38.731 --> 01:02:40.570
<v Speaker 2>anti gun liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they,</v>

1518
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:42.120
<v Speaker 2>they say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1519
01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:44.790
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these cops are so evil and racist and,</v>

1520
01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.760
<v Speaker 2>and they hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hate blacks but an only they should</v>

1521
01:02:47.761 --> 01:02:48.594
<v Speaker 2>own guns.</v>

1522
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.281
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there,</v>

1523
01:02:50.281 --> 01:02:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean that goes to the heart of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

1524
01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:53.790
<v Speaker 2>which is always how corrupt and evil the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system is.</v>

1525
01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.070
<v Speaker 2>What's the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make the system bigger.</v>

1526
01:02:56.110 --> 01:02:57.570
<v Speaker 2>I think this system bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1527
01:02:57.571 --> 01:02:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Hire more cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1528
01:02:59.191 --> 01:02:59.641
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1529
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:02.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't usually get off on seeing people</v>

1530
01:03:02.611 --> 01:03:03.610
<v Speaker 2>get harmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you.</v>

1531
01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.473
<v Speaker 2>It was some irony in occupy Wall Street </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of these definitions of people </v>

1532
01:03:07.621 --> 01:03:10.440
<v Speaker 2>calling for more government and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get government right in the face or</v>

1533
01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:11.500
<v Speaker 2>the pepper spray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1534
01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:13.650
<v Speaker 2>You wanted more government and there it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1535
01:03:13.651 --> 01:03:16.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that is the ultimate result of the,</v>

1536
01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.670
<v Speaker 2>of the call for more state intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1537
01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Speaker 2>So there is some irony there when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

1538
01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:23.390
<v Speaker 2>when you see a leftist get bashed over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the head by,</v>

1539
01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.293
<v Speaker 2>by the police truncheon that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially what they're calling for </v>

1540
01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:30.390
<v Speaker 2>when they say we need more regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need higher taxes.</v>

1541
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the state because as Mao Zedong </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1542
01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:33.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all political power flows from the </v>

1543
01:03:34.681 --> 01:03:35.514
<v Speaker 2>barrel of a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to be careful about the </v>

1544
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:39.190
<v Speaker 2>use of power because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fire,</v>

1545
01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:40.620
<v Speaker 2>it's forced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not reason.</v>

1546
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abortion,</v>

1547
01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:43.920
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>

1548
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:45.953
<v Speaker 2>So I had a flip on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not before way before I ever thought </v>

1549
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:51.080
<v Speaker 2>about running for office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1550
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.200
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1551
01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:52.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

1552
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm a secularist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1553
01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1554
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:55.263
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in empirical study and data and </v>

1555
01:03:57.031 --> 01:04:00.180
<v Speaker 2>science and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't have some sort of,</v>

1556
01:04:00.181 --> 01:04:03.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some divine intervention that said,</v>

1557
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.931
<v Speaker 2>Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1558
01:04:03.931 --> 01:04:05.160
<v Speaker 2>you need to believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1559
01:04:05.161 --> 01:04:05.994
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I started to listen to some of </v>

1560
01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:08.514
<v Speaker 2>the secular prolifers arguments on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was convinced people like Christopher </v>

1561
01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:13.733
<v Speaker 2>Hitchens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even bill Maher as has said at some </v>

1562
01:04:15.541 --> 01:04:17.490
<v Speaker 2>point to express some sympathy towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1563
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.720
<v Speaker 2>the unborn child.</v>

1564
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the question in my mind is,</v>

1565
01:04:22.001 --> 01:04:23.220
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a life?</v>

1566
01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:24.293
<v Speaker 2>Is it a human life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the answer to that question is </v>

1567
01:04:25.801 --> 01:04:26.634
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it gets down to the question </v>

1568
01:04:28.501 --> 01:04:28.710
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1569
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:29.880
<v Speaker 2>when does life begin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1570
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:33.450
<v Speaker 2>can I be intellectually honest and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because I'm not a scientist</v>

1571
01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.960
<v Speaker 2>and that I don't know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm to make a mistake,</v>

1572
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would probably think it would be.</v>

1573
01:04:38.971 --> 01:04:42.270
<v Speaker 2>The moral question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should you err on the side of life?</v>

1574
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:44.700
<v Speaker 2>So I think that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should err on the side of life.</v>

1575
01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1576
01:04:46.201 --> 01:04:47.034
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a scientific or empirical </v>

1577
01:04:48.511 --> 01:04:49.290
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my,</v>

1578
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:50.123
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my little sister is adopted and she was </v>

1579
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.590
<v Speaker 2>slated to be boarded by her mother and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we convinced her not,</v>

1580
01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:02.370
<v Speaker 2>not to abort and then we adopted her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think to myself,</v>

1581
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:03.091
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1582
01:05:03.091 --> 01:05:06.030
<v Speaker 2>like I'm so glad that she's alive.</v>

1583
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:09.480
<v Speaker 2>And I say then I think about all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who want children for adoptions.</v>

1584
01:05:09.481 --> 01:05:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Because while we were going through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>adoption process,</v>

1585
01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:12.723
<v Speaker 2>that was 11 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was learning about the adoption </v>

1586
01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:16.044
<v Speaker 2>process and studying it and I realized </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many parents just really want </v>

1587
01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:22.180
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that it,</v>

1588
01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:26.740
<v Speaker 2>abortion for convenience is a problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>morally.</v>

1589
01:05:26.741 --> 01:05:29.170
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a problem because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you really,</v>

1590
01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.150
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to live in a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

1591
01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>we should encourage people to adopt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not to say,</v>

1592
01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1593
01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:38.740
<v Speaker 2>you conservative or liberal prolife </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians only care about a baby once</v>

1594
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:39.730
<v Speaker 2>it's born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1595
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.970
<v Speaker 2>But that's not true because my family </v>
<v Speaker 2>adopted,</v>

1596
01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:43.893
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know many parents who are dying to </v>

1597
01:05:45.971 --> 01:05:47.320
<v Speaker 2>adopt children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1598
01:05:47.321 --> 01:05:48.154
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to have kids one day and if I </v>

1599
01:05:48.881 --> 01:05:50.830
<v Speaker 2>can't have kids I'm going to adopt.</v>

1600
01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:52.540
<v Speaker 2>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1601
01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.493
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with knowing that this isn't a perfect </v>

1602
01:05:55.901 --> 01:05:57.380
<v Speaker 2>world and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1603
01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.800
<v Speaker 2>we're never going to be able to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely ban it.</v>

1604
01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela tries to do that.</v>

1605
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.453
<v Speaker 2>If that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we can probably agree that </v>

1606
01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:07.750
<v Speaker 2>abortion isn't a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people think it's a good thing,</v>

1607
01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:11.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's fetishized in a bizarre way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1608
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:13.510
<v Speaker 2>but I think most people don't think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good thing.</v>

1609
01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.553
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is the stigma or the shame attached </v>

1610
01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:18.730
<v Speaker 2>to it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that if that's true,</v>

1611
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I think science is going to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>new ways for us to,</v>

1612
01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.940
<v Speaker 2>to save the kids of the life of </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

1613
01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1614
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:28.300
<v Speaker 2>earlier and earlier perhaps that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be some options there.</v>

1615
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:29.283
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of Catholic charities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would spend millions of dollars to see </v>

1616
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.220
<v Speaker 2>technology like that come to the light </v>
<v Speaker 2>of day.</v>

1617
01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:37.203
<v Speaker 2>So I think that that looking to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future that abortion is probably going </v>

1618
01:06:39.781 --> 01:06:40.614
<v Speaker 2>to become less of a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because birth control is </v>

1619
01:06:42.071 --> 01:06:45.040
<v Speaker 2>becoming so much more available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it comes to the law,</v>

1620
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 2>the first things that I would like to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to policy,</v>

1621
01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.030
<v Speaker 2>try and find the most non coercive way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to reduce the amount of abortions.</v>

1622
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:53.103
<v Speaker 2>The number one simplest way that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people very upset still is to just </v>

1623
01:06:56.231 --> 01:07:01.000
<v Speaker 2>legalize birth control over the counter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1624
01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:03.700
<v Speaker 2>that comes part and parcel with ending </v>
<v Speaker 2>the war on drugs.</v>

1625
01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.753
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there some institutional </v>

1626
01:07:05.801 --> 01:07:09.100
<v Speaker 2>challenges there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that abortion is wrong.</v>

1627
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:11.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that it is a human life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that as a,</v>

1628
01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:15.730
<v Speaker 2>as a society that we should protect the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If government is to exist,</v>

1629
01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:16.773
<v Speaker 2>then its role should be to protect those</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cannot protect themselves and I </v>

1630
01:07:19.511 --> 01:07:21.340
<v Speaker 2>think that that should include the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unborn.</v>

1631
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course we have federal challenges</v>

1632
01:07:23.621 --> 01:07:25.570
<v Speaker 2>to that and we have court challenges </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1633
01:07:25.571 --> 01:07:27.660
<v Speaker 2>We have stated challenges with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

1634
01:07:27.661 --> 01:07:28.494
<v Speaker 2>I try and make the moral argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>because unless we can win the moral </v>

1635
01:07:30.041 --> 01:07:32.290
<v Speaker 2>argument will never win the legislative </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

1636
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1637
01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Well I liked the way you framed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument there because it's also nice to</v>

1638
01:07:35.701 --> 01:07:38.760
<v Speaker 1>occasionally hear someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know everything and you're not a</v>

1639
01:07:38.761 --> 01:07:39.594
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that there's an actual moral </v>

1640
01:07:41.251 --> 01:07:42.084
<v Speaker 1>quandary here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you make of a couple of weeks </v>

1641
01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.250
<v Speaker 1>ago when Tomi Lahren came out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1642
01:07:47.251 --> 01:07:48.084
<v Speaker 1>that she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using her conservative principles is </v>

1643
01:07:50.551 --> 01:07:51.384
<v Speaker 1>actually approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that she said she herself </v>

1644
01:07:53.251 --> 01:07:54.084
<v Speaker 1>was pro choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she said that she didn't want the </v>

1645
01:07:55.711 --> 01:07:59.970
<v Speaker 1>government basically legislating what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman could do with her body.</v>

1646
01:07:59.971 --> 01:08:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I do see that as an intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent a position.</v>

1647
01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.393
<v Speaker 1>It may not be the conservative position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may not be the position that that </v>

1648
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Glenn Beck who I like and who's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>chair believes and he did what he did.</v>

1649
01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>God shows no longer on the blaze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole separate issue,</v>

1650
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.990
<v Speaker 2>but do you think that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimacy to the argument?</v>

1651
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:19.840
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1652
01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:20.420
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1653
01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.010
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that popped into my head</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1654
01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:22.844
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's had an abortion because three </v>

1655
01:08:23.931 --> 01:08:24.764
<v Speaker 2>weeks before that she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a video from being a </v>

1656
01:08:27.351 --> 01:08:29.240
<v Speaker 2>complete hypocrite here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something happened.</v>

1657
01:08:29.241 --> 01:08:30.350
<v Speaker 2>That was my first thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I was like,</v>

1658
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:31.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't prove that,</v>

1659
01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:33.770
<v Speaker 2>and then I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1660
01:08:33.771 --> 01:08:35.360
<v Speaker 2>so what is this really all about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1661
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:38.630
<v Speaker 2>if the argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the government has no prevailing</v>

1662
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.970
<v Speaker 2>interest in getting involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a woman's body,</v>

1663
01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:42.073
<v Speaker 2>well then can the government save the </v>
<v Speaker 2>child if something's wrong with the </v>

1664
01:08:43.941 --> 01:08:44.930
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she's in a coma,</v>

1665
01:08:44.931 --> 01:08:46.490
<v Speaker 2>can the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can the government take the child out?</v>

1666
01:08:46.491 --> 01:08:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that the,</v>

1667
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.823
<v Speaker 2>the situation happens where the mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>is life is actually in danger and the </v>

1668
01:08:53.061 --> 01:08:54.800
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the mother can't give consent.</v>

1669
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.633
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can the nurse then save the life of the </v>

1670
01:08:56.931 --> 01:08:57.764
<v Speaker 2>Child?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what if the mother at the time </v>

1671
01:08:58.401 --> 01:09:01.160
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want the child to be born?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if she woke up and decided,</v>

1672
01:09:01.161 --> 01:09:01.994
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't actually want to have an </v>

1673
01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 2>abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1674
01:09:03.651 --> 01:09:04.484
<v Speaker 2>What would the nurse probably not try </v>
<v Speaker 2>and save the life of the child by </v>

1675
01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:09.950
<v Speaker 2>default because she thinks of it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

1676
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:13.460
<v Speaker 2>When beyonce posted pictures of her </v>
<v Speaker 2>being pregnant,</v>

1677
01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:15.830
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the liberals were saying that,</v>

1678
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:17.030
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are babies.</v>

1679
01:09:17.031 --> 01:09:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Those are children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are humans,</v>

1680
01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:19.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

1681
01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:21.500
<v Speaker 2>but they're not babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not humans.</v>

1682
01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:22.643
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to the timing there </v>

1683
01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:24.034
<v Speaker 2>and thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she probably just says whatever </v>

1684
01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:25.964
<v Speaker 2>she can say to get traffic and clicks </v>
<v Speaker 2>and God knows I've been so tempted to </v>

1685
01:09:28.701 --> 01:09:31.520
<v Speaker 2>fall into her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her example because you could make a lot</v>

1686
01:09:31.521 --> 01:09:32.354
<v Speaker 2>more money that way.</v>

1687
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:33.260
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1688
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.093
<v Speaker 2>I think that when it comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question of whether it's consistent or </v>

1689
01:09:36.711 --> 01:09:39.050
<v Speaker 2>not for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a government to intervene,</v>

1690
01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:43.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean even Gary Johnson who parades </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself around as a pro choicer signed a</v>

1691
01:09:43.671 --> 01:09:44.504
<v Speaker 2>partial birth abortion ban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a most abortions do occur within the </v>

1692
01:09:47.721 --> 01:09:49.280
<v Speaker 2>first trimester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1693
01:09:49.281 --> 01:09:50.510
<v Speaker 2>but the real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1694
01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:51.344
<v Speaker 2>when I said we're full circle here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most politically incorrect thing </v>

1695
01:09:53.901 --> 01:09:54.734
<v Speaker 2>that you can say is that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally responsible is that we have </v>

1696
01:09:58.431 --> 01:10:01.670
<v Speaker 2>things called condoms and birth control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you are supposed to take care.</v>

1697
01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Because the problem with the liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument of freedom is,</v>

1698
01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 2>is that I am free to not only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1699
01:10:08.691 --> 01:10:09.524
<v Speaker 2>destroy other people's lives and harm </v>
<v Speaker 2>and create harm and have the government </v>

1700
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:13.753
<v Speaker 2>solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm also free to self destruct and </v>

1701
01:10:15.381 --> 01:10:18.020
<v Speaker 2>to make you pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a prime example of that is,</v>

1702
01:10:18.021 --> 01:10:18.860
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1703
01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.110
<v Speaker 2>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare,</v>

1704
01:10:21.111 --> 01:10:21.944
<v Speaker 2>I was there the day that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the liberals were unironically smoking </v>

1705
01:10:24.711 --> 01:10:25.544
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes after it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because they were necessarily </v>

1706
01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:29.540
<v Speaker 2>addicted to nicotine.</v>

1707
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.373
<v Speaker 2>It was a side to the rest of us that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do whatever I want and now you have </v>

1708
01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:35.450
<v Speaker 2>to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1709
01:10:35.451 --> 01:10:37.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who think that taxpayer</v>

1710
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:39.310
<v Speaker 2>funded abortions should exist and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1711
01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:42.680
<v Speaker 2>we should pay for those decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes down to it,</v>

1712
01:10:42.681 --> 01:10:45.590
<v Speaker 2>if it is killing a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's killing a human child,</v>

1713
01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:49.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't you be personally responsible?</v>

1714
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't you have been careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand?</v>

1715
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:53.540
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got the questions of rape and all</v>

1716
01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.730
<v Speaker 2>these other things that come into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is always like a t,</v>

1717
01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd like to take tiny,</v>

1718
01:10:57.021 --> 01:11:00.110
<v Speaker 2>tiny exceptions to rules and then blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>them out and conflict to the rules.</v>

1719
01:11:00.111 --> 01:11:00.944
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know everything and the </v>

1720
01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.210
<v Speaker 2>government cannot possibly legislate </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Washington DC,</v>

1721
01:11:05.211 --> 01:11:06.044
<v Speaker 2>all of these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is why I think it should be a </v>

1722
01:11:07.371 --> 01:11:10.700
<v Speaker 2>state issue because I think from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrative question,</v>

1723
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:11.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state should be allowed to </v>

1724
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:17.130
<v Speaker 2>laboratories of democracy in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right when it comes to the war on drugs,</v>

1725
01:11:17.131 --> 01:11:18.630
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1726
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the war on drugs was ended federally,</v>

1727
01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Texas might execute you for looking at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>joint.</v>

1728
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be like they may have,</v>

1729
01:11:27.301 --> 01:11:28.134
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can execute you for not smoking or </v>

1730
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.310
<v Speaker 2>not smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1731
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.233
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the thing is that there are </v>

1732
01:11:32.341 --> 01:11:35.280
<v Speaker 2>some problems with federalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think when it comes to issues,</v>

1733
01:11:35.281 --> 01:11:37.890
<v Speaker 2>especially with life and death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those things are better handled the</v>

1734
01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:39.330
<v Speaker 2>close to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the smaller,</v>

1735
01:11:39.331 --> 01:11:41.310
<v Speaker 2>the tighter knit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the community so that it's,</v>

1736
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:42.163
<v Speaker 2>it's so that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the negative externalities aren't </v>

1737
01:11:43.581 --> 01:11:44.414
<v Speaker 2>projected on the rest of this because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly don't think I should be </v>

1738
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:47.910
<v Speaker 2>funding abortions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1739
01:11:47.911 --> 01:11:48.700
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1740
01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:49.533
<v Speaker 2>that if I think it's a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I certainly should not be taxed to </v>

1741
01:11:52.111 --> 01:11:52.944
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just such a place where there's so </v>

1742
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:59.250
<v Speaker 2>much richness for conversation where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can find people that are perfectly moral</v>

1743
01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:00.383
<v Speaker 2>and just view things a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently because I do get the Tommy </v>

1744
01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.350
<v Speaker 2>argument there of keeping the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of it and I,</v>

1745
01:12:06.351 --> 01:12:07.184
<v Speaker 2>I personally am pro choice but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find great pleasure in it at all </v>

1746
01:12:11.251 --> 01:12:12.880
<v Speaker 2>and I have all sorts of issues with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1747
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.300
<v Speaker 2>later term abortions and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1748
01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>

1749
01:12:17.011 --> 01:12:19.080
<v Speaker 2>this is one of those ones that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

1750
01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:20.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we make a mistake if we looked at </v>

1751
01:12:21.091 --> 01:12:21.924
<v Speaker 2>Tommy for intellectual stimulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is an a and I hope she'll be here </v>

1752
01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:28.360
<v Speaker 2>so that I can ask her about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1753
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:29.970
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last question.</v>

1754
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:32.170
<v Speaker 2>And I already told you what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a 20,</v>

1755
01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:33.060
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing this.</v>

1756
01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:34.210
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1757
01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like running for office.</v>

1758
01:12:37.141 --> 01:12:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1759
01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:40.210
<v Speaker 2>I really despise it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1760
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.510
<v Speaker 2>as libertarian I really liked my </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal life.</v>

1761
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Now I have looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have said Austin go run for lower</v>

1762
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:48.204
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I have looked at potentially </v>

1763
01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:50.574
<v Speaker 2>running in Missouri for Senate seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've still got about a two or three </v>

1764
01:12:54.691 --> 01:12:56.970
<v Speaker 2>months before I have to decide some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

1765
01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.160
<v Speaker 2>but maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1766
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:59.423
<v Speaker 2>I ran for president because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>timing and because I thought that there </v>

1767
01:13:01.681 --> 01:13:04.380
<v Speaker 2>just weren't that many good people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented my beliefs.</v>

1768
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.513
<v Speaker 2>And so I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't run last year just because I </v>

1769
01:13:06.691 --> 01:13:08.820
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be the king of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

1770
01:13:08.821 --> 01:13:13.821
<v Speaker 2>I ran because I thought that that Donald</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hillary were so distasteful and Gary</v>

1771
01:13:13.861 --> 01:13:14.694
<v Speaker 2>was not the strongest candidate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I would look good by default and </v>

1772
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could get our ideas out there.</v>

1773
01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:20.610
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

1774
01:13:20.611 --> 01:13:21.444
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>

1775
01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.171
<v Speaker 2>in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1776
01:13:22.171 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 2>I didn't win the presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in many ways I won the argument in a</v>

1777
01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:26.484
<v Speaker 2>lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at retrospectively because a lot </v>

1778
01:13:28.081 --> 01:13:30.270
<v Speaker 2>more people are now interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian ideas,</v>

1779
01:13:30.271 --> 01:13:31.860
<v Speaker 2>which is one of my goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1780
01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.990
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to running for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president in 20,</v>

1781
01:13:33.991 --> 01:13:34.824
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to respectfully decline at </v>

1782
01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:40.200
<v Speaker 2>this time and say that maybe it would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>better for me to try and do something at</v>

1783
01:13:40.201 --> 01:13:43.200
<v Speaker 2>this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would not be an altruist perhaps,</v>

1784
01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:44.610
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but try and do something,</v>

1785
01:13:44.611 --> 01:13:45.444
<v Speaker 2>give something back to the citizens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my state who have got a horrible </v>

1786
01:13:47.911 --> 01:13:49.680
<v Speaker 2>senator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Claire mccaskill,</v>

1787
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:50.843
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's now for complete partisan </v>

1788
01:13:52.741 --> 01:13:53.574
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

1789
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:54.463
<v Speaker 2>She should kind of shooting yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the foot saying she's going to </v>

1790
01:13:55.591 --> 01:13:56.424
<v Speaker 2>Filibuster Neil gorsuch and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's doing this because she's </v>

1791
01:13:59.461 --> 01:14:01.530
<v Speaker 2>terrified of the progressives in our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

1792
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bernie Bros and all that,</v>

1793
01:14:03.181 --> 01:14:04.014
<v Speaker 2>or they're threatened threatening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary or so now she's being pushed so </v>

1794
01:14:06.811 --> 01:14:07.950
<v Speaker 2>hard to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going,</v>

1795
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing what Hillary did,</v>

1796
01:14:09.331 --> 01:14:12.430
<v Speaker 2>the mistakes and Hillary made going hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>left as you can,</v>

1797
01:14:12.431 --> 01:14:17.200
<v Speaker 2>hoping that those socialists and Social </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats are going to push her into it.</v>

1798
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:18.423
<v Speaker 2>But if I think that there is an opening </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to maybe run for Senate in </v>

1799
01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Missouri Than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than I might pursue that.</v>

1800
01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:24.370
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but God,</v>

1801
01:14:24.371 --> 01:14:25.204
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what's happening to trump on a </v>

1802
01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:27.670
<v Speaker 2>daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1803
01:14:27.671 --> 01:14:28.504
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really have that much of a lust </v>

1804
01:14:29.771 --> 01:14:30.910
<v Speaker 2>for power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1805
01:14:30.911 --> 01:14:33.220
<v Speaker 2>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we see the inherent problem with all</v>

1806
01:14:33.221 --> 01:14:33.700
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>

1807
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Good principled people simply don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be part of this game anymore.</v>

1808
01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 2>So you're left with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1809
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:41.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it destroys you,</v>

1810
01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:42.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1811
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:43.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every little personal thing that you've </v>

1812
01:14:44.471 --> 01:14:45.340
<v Speaker 2>ever said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1813
01:14:45.341 --> 01:14:46.174
<v Speaker 2>Every job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every off color joke that you've ever </v>

1814
01:14:47.351 --> 01:14:49.510
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say suddenly used to demonize you.</v>

1815
01:14:49.511 --> 01:14:50.344
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a good person until </v>

1816
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 2>last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that as a sexist,</v>

1817
01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:57.340
<v Speaker 2>misogynist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of these things.</v>

1818
01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.830
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when you look at it,</v>

1819
01:14:59.831 --> 01:15:01.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like the truth is who is fit to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rule?</v>

1820
01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's really fit to rule over all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>us and the,</v>

1821
01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:05.950
<v Speaker 2>and the power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has so much power.</v>

1822
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:07.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1823
01:15:07.931 --> 01:15:09.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point I'm going to save me.</v>

1824
01:15:09.511 --> 01:15:11.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't really have an interest in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1825
01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:12.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put it on the record.</v>

1826
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.290
<v Speaker 2>So now if you do end up running for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason,</v>

1827
01:15:14.291 --> 01:15:15.750
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be considered a flip </v>
<v Speaker 2>flop.</v>

1828
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:19.900
<v Speaker 2>But they always do that to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Donald Trump said,</v>

1829
01:15:19.901 --> 01:15:21.010
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to run for president.</v>

1830
01:15:21.011 --> 01:15:22.150
<v Speaker 2>And he runs for president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1831
01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:24.280
<v Speaker 2>It always does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1832
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.770
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the minuscule chance that you know,</v>

1833
01:15:26.771 --> 01:15:29.620
<v Speaker 2>that I feel like I can see I'm called to</v>
<v Speaker 2>public service,</v>

1834
01:15:29.621 --> 01:15:32.740
<v Speaker 2>which is what it should be.</v>
