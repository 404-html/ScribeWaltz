1
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.973
<v Speaker 1>So last Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the progressive website mother Jones </v>

2
00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:09.154
<v Speaker 1>included me in an article about a quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>new extremist media industry that is </v>

3
00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:16.390
<v Speaker 1>further to the right than Breitbart in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the piece.</v>

4
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:20.500
<v Speaker 1>The author referred to me as quote far </v>
<v Speaker 1>right sighting interviews I've done with</v>

5
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Mike Cernovich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos and lauren southern to</v>

6
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>backup his accusation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Cherry picked these guests to fit his</v>

7
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:27.904
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet somehow miss the endless amount of </v>

8
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:30.244
<v Speaker 1>liberals I've had on the show and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the progressive's I've hosted as </v>

9
00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:34.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Margaret Cho,</v>

10
00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Hilary Rosen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark duplass,</v>

11
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.263
<v Speaker 1>John Fugal sang and Michael Ian Black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The article also attack Patrion the </v>

12
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:41.884
<v Speaker 1>crowd funding platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which myself and my team's livelihood </v>

13
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:45.514
<v Speaker 1>depends on for being tolerant of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with quote far right views such as mine </v>

14
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.453
<v Speaker 1>though of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere did it include any of my </v>

15
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 1>purported far right views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earlier in the week,</v>

16
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Forbes called the Rubin report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conservative talk show,</v>

17
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Speaker 1>but immediately retracted the statement </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I contacted them.</v>

18
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.843
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying for a while that </v>

19
00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>defending my liberal beliefs is becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conservative position.</v>

20
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Although I don't think being called a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative is somehow a pejorative.</v>

21
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.593
<v Speaker 1>It clearly isn't a proper descriptor for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this show in which I posted people from </v>

22
00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:17.854
<v Speaker 1>across the political divide for Mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones to accuse me of being an </v>

23
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:21.934
<v Speaker 1>extremist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further to the right of Breitbart is </v>

24
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>obviously an inflammatory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrably dishonest statement.</v>

25
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.483
<v Speaker 1>I've been around many people over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last few years who've been unfairly </v>

26
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>maligned and I'm all too familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 1>how this goes,</v>

27
00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.020
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson,</v>

28
00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Collin Moriarty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Ayaan,</v>

29
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:40.204
<v Speaker 1>Hirsi Ali or Bret Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each attack is virtually never based on </v>

30
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:44.524
<v Speaker 1>what these people have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is instead crafted out of Straw man </v>

31
00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>arguments with the words racist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigot tossed around like Andy.</v>

32
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.413
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the onus is on the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't racists or bigots to disprove </v>

33
00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:57.934
<v Speaker 1>this accusation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually slung by a misguided celebrity </v>

34
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.680
<v Speaker 1>or a malicious newspaper or website.</v>

35
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.843
<v Speaker 1>The move then is on the accused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should they spend the time and energy </v>

36
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:10.690
<v Speaker 1>defending themselves from accusations </v>
<v Speaker 1>which aren't true,</v>

37
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.673
<v Speaker 1>only to bring more attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusations themselves or should they </v>

38
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:15.754
<v Speaker 1>ignore them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping that the false claims will go </v>

39
00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:18.484
<v Speaker 1>away over time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are solid arguments to be </v>

40
00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>made for either tactic and it truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on the situation at hand and the</v>

41
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:27.340
<v Speaker 1>person involved in this case involving </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

42
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:28.174
<v Speaker 1>I went on the attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided this case was to agregious to </v>

43
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>ignore and I contacted the articles </v>
<v Speaker 1>author via twitter,</v>

44
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.040
<v Speaker 1>screenshotting pieces of his article and</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking him to defend them.</v>

45
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Of course he couldn't defend his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

46
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.363
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing with truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to work around and eventually </v>

47
00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:45.574
<v Speaker 1>he made slight changes to the article </v>
<v Speaker 1>like including a tweet of mine in which </v>

48
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:49.804
<v Speaker 1>I defended myself from his claims and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>removed the word far in front of the </v>

49
00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:57.550
<v Speaker 1>word right before referencing me in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>

50
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>putting the rest of the specifics of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>article itself,</v>

51
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:02.284
<v Speaker 1>I was happy to get a strong defense in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public for many friends all over the </v>

52
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.274
<v Speaker 1>political map.</v>

53
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>People like Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Collin Moriarity,</v>

54
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Feisal site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all Matar,</v>

55
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Bret Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Weinstein,</v>

56
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Posey,</v>

57
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.093
<v Speaker 1>and in many others offered strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>defenses of me just as I've offered for </v>

58
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>others when I've seen them unfairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked.</v>

59
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.733
<v Speaker 1>I even got a public defense from Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump jr putting my friends in public </v>

60
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.893
<v Speaker 1>allies aside though it's incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring and humbling to see literally </v>

61
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:30.544
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of people offer their </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice when they feel you've been </v>

62
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>unjustly attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the key to this whole thing.</v>

63
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not me or Sam or Jordan or Brett </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they fear.</v>

64
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>What they really fear is that all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

65
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>we'll start saying what you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's strength in numbers.</v>

66
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>By Monday I wanted to put this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>story behind me.</v>

67
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>My dog had a health emergency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually put this whole thing into</v>

68
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

69
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:56.284
<v Speaker 1>but I admit I did get sucked back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story very briefly over the course </v>

70
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>of another twitter exchange.</v>

71
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.833
<v Speaker 1>I got the writer of the piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh Harkinson to publicly admit that I </v>

72
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:06.634
<v Speaker 1>am not further right than Breitbart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though of course he didn't change the </v>

73
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>title or have mother Jones issue any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of public correction.</v>

74
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>One other interesting piece to all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the writer,</v>

75
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Josh Harkinson is one of the 40 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that James Hodgkinson,</v>

76
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>the shooter of the Republican Baseball </v>
<v Speaker 1>team last week in Virginia,</v>

77
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>followed on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

78
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:26.914
<v Speaker 1>I can't draw a direct link there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know that Hodgkinson was a far </v>

79
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>left lefty who was obviously driven to </v>
<v Speaker 1>political extremes,</v>

80
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>so when this very same writer does a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatchet job on me calling me further,</v>

81
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>right than Breitbart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is clearly a code for racist,</v>

82
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't sit back there and take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly why I've been saying you</v>

83
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:48.454
<v Speaker 1>can't punch Nazis call everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You oppose a Nazi and a racist and then </v>

84
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 1>eventually you will see violence as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next logical step.</v>

85
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.423
<v Speaker 1>It's not a crazy exercise to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is partially what drove James </v>

86
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Hodgkinson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In hindsight.</v>

87
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:03.544
<v Speaker 1>His attack on me was the next obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>step in where this whole collectivist </v>

88
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>movement is going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked for a long time about how if</v>

89
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>you can't debate ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use lies in buzzwords.</v>

90
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Having a turned on me shouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a surprise,</v>

91
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>especially from a leftist site like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother Jones.</v>

92
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Yet somehow it did still surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake.</v>

93
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.483
<v Speaker 1>There is a think acquisition going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and it can come for anyone at any </v>

94
00:05:25.521 --> 00:05:26.354
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ally yourself with people who </v>

95
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:29.584
<v Speaker 1>value the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case a political movement over </v>

96
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.124
<v Speaker 1>you as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then eventually it is inevitable that </v>

97
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 1>they will come for you and if they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>come for you,</v>

98
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:40.114
<v Speaker 1>your probably the one coming for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This think was issued will come after </v>

99
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:44.344
<v Speaker 1>anyone who bucks the trend and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes and dares think for </v>

100
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:47.944
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

101
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>It's why they accused Ayaan Hirsi Ali of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being anti Muslim.</v>

102
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 1>It's why they slander Bill Maher as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a racist.</v>

103
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:55.564
<v Speaker 1>It's why they call Larry elder and uncle</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom and it's apparently they can brand </v>

104
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>me a far right extremist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who are a part of this thing,</v>

105
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:03.674
<v Speaker 1>acquisition fear you thinking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that you won't bow to their </v>

106
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>collectivists demands more than anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

107
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.623
<v Speaker 1>The way to beat this witch hunt is to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and fight for what you believe </v>

108
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you are the antidote that they fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>

109
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.543
<v Speaker 1>I hope that next time you see me </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting back and getting some cover </v>

110
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:23.144
<v Speaker 1>from my allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will inspire you to fight back </v>

111
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 1>specifically with words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not violence as well.</v>

112
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Joining me on the show this week is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my afro mentioned allies and a friend</v>

113
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>and author and professor Peter </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boghossian,</v>

114
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>who's going to help me dissect some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the madness of 2017 and much more.</v>

115
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.023
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is an author and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor of philosophy at Portland </v>

116
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.730
<v Speaker 1>State University and a man who strives </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a good human every day.</v>

117
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Peter [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome back.</v>

118
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>It's great to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks and thanks for the striving to be</v>

119
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:00.104
<v Speaker 1>a good human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd never know it from what people </v>

120
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.300
<v Speaker 1>have been saying about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well certainly about me,</v>

121
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.203
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really been through the ringer in </v>

122
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 1>the last few days and I would love to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to that and talk about that.</v>

123
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 1>I suspect we can get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but strives to be a good human being.</v>

124
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:18.630
<v Speaker 1>The reason I threw that in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that seems to me you were on the</v>

125
00:07:18.631 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 1>show about a year and a half ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had never met before that we've since</v>

126
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:24.400
<v Speaker 1>become very good for her in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hit A,</v>

127
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.273
<v Speaker 1>we hit it off instantly just like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you were on the show and we'll </v>

128
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 1>link to it down below so that people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the initial sit down.</v>

129
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.603
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt that it was one of the episodes </v>

130
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:36.590
<v Speaker 1>where so many of the things that I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been thinking about,</v>

131
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>about the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about politics,</v>

132
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:43.020
<v Speaker 1>about religion and so many of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of all came to get whole.</v>

133
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really did and I felt I felt richer</v>

134
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do often in some interviews,</v>

135
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:48.734
<v Speaker 1>some interviews I feel dumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was one way I felt richer and </v>

136
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:56.030
<v Speaker 1>since we've become friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do strive to be a pretty decent,</v>

137
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

138
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.793
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how should I introduce you in the </v>

139
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 1>beginning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking don't ask that.</v>

140
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:01.574
<v Speaker 1>Normally the only reason I asked is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're friends and I thought </v>

141
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.483
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's some person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little anecdote or something that you </v>

142
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:06.944
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really,</v>

143
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I really just striving to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

144
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that matter is that kindness,</v>

145
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:14.270
<v Speaker 1>that compassion.</v>

146
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I think we've so lost it and acrimonious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're so hyper partisan where so and</v>

147
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:20.234
<v Speaker 1>the college craziness and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been going on and they at the </v>

148
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:24.644
<v Speaker 1>attacks and the people will give you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to respond to those attacks </v>

149
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>and the negativity on social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

150
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to be a good guy and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to live a good life,</v>

151
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the last couple of months you lost</v>

152
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 1>your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

153
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>That was the seminal event of one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>seminal events in my life.</v>

154
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>How do you stay a good person throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

155
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.953
<v Speaker 1>Not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that losing someone's going to make </v>

156
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 1>you a bad person obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're still trying to work.</v>

157
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>You're still trying to be a public </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and to and like how do you manage</v>

158
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.083
<v Speaker 2>not just going nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the course of that I had some </v>

159
00:08:58.651 --> 00:08:59.484
<v Speaker 2>health issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the emergency room three times </v>

160
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 2>the last few months I have Crohn's </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

161
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 2>So that that's not doing me any favors </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

162
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Without getting too deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

163
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 2>you were in the hospital today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

164
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want me to tell it to people,</v>

165
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.473
<v Speaker 2>stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think open about it and I think </v>

166
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:16.074
<v Speaker 2>that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really does make every moment of </v>

167
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 2>your life precious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when my,</v>

168
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 2>my dad died and my mom died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

169
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.253
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of a combination of feeling </v>

170
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.600
<v Speaker 2>more circumspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

171
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 2>and I've always had in the back of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

172
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 2>my parents have probation or what my dad</v>
<v Speaker 2>think or my mom thing.</v>

173
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.080
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of really given me an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to,</v>

174
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:40.914
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to frame it positively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it trying to given me me an opportunity </v>

175
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 2>to reflect on what they did for me in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and try to do that for my kids.</v>

176
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.840
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when living navigating that reality,</v>

177
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 2>when your parents have died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very intense.</v>

178
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.610
<v Speaker 2>even little things like you get in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

180
00:09:57.611 --> 00:09:58.444
<v Speaker 2>he shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's getting the car and she'd call my </v>

181
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 2>dad or I call my mom and I don't do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

182
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I was thinking today,</v>

183
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the idea that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed it.</v>

184
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're debt,</v>

185
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.583
<v Speaker 2>they've died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a permanence to that and that </v>

186
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:15.180
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I am always taking to myself like,</v>

187
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 2>oh my mom would like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad like that.</v>

188
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 2>And the real quick one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

189
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.030
<v Speaker 2>my mom died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

190
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't really into her funeral that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understood that she died,</v>

191
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 2>like really grokked it because someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>fell asleep and her funeral.</v>

192
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:31.981
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

193
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 2>my mom would think that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would love that.</v>

194
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.023
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized like I could never </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell her that I could never tell her </v>

195
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 2>anything again.</v>

196
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.603
<v Speaker 2>And those pillars in your life that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't go to in times of joy in times of </v>

197
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:46.951
<v Speaker 2>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

198
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 2>it was in the hospital for another time </v>
<v Speaker 2>for my Crohn's disease.</v>

199
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 2>My Dad stayed up with me all night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was there.</v>

200
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 2>And that part of my life is gone now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

201
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.720
<v Speaker 2>So as a philosophy professor and as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>well known and outspoken atheist,</v>

202
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.193
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're challenged with something </v>

203
00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:06.000
<v Speaker 2>like the death of a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did any of your beliefs get challenged?</v>

204
00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:06.834
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a moment at right after your </v>

205
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:11.040
<v Speaker 2>dad passed where you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

206
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:11.874
<v Speaker 2>I want to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or did you maybe have a dream that </v>

207
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 2>seemed different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

208
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.090
<v Speaker 2>something like that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know my feelings on roof and I,</v>

209
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not a believer in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional sense,</v>

210
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 2>and yet occasionally things happen that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

211
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.070
<v Speaker 2>what was that after my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandma passed too.</v>

212
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.280
<v Speaker 2>I was very close with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

213
00:11:27.281 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I had some very vivid dreams that seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

214
00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:31.530
<v Speaker 2>she was telling me something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

215
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:34.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I buy it for all of this,</v>

216
00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:38.020
<v Speaker 2>but it has some value to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have any of that or no?</v>

217
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.671
<v Speaker 2>Have any of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

218
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:39.504
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just incredibly bereaved and I </v>

219
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:44.360
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

220
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 2>it mean it was just a shattering of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>type of reality for me.</v>

221
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.073
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also made me realize that it </v>

222
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 2>really is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that every moment of life is precious.</v>

223
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Just have to be so grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go through life with a sort of gratitude</v>

224
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:58.354
<v Speaker 2>for the experiences that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you hear someone like me that </v>

225
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.290
<v Speaker 2>you know pretty well say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

226
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandma passed away and then,</v>

227
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can tell you about the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in her apartment,</v>

228
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 2>she looked amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like glowing and she was wearing</v>

229
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:09.844
<v Speaker 2>all black and she had these like green </v>
<v Speaker 2>neon streaks in her hair and she was </v>

230
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:13.690
<v Speaker 2>like running in place really fast.</v>

231
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.360
<v Speaker 2>And she was telling me how excited she </v>
<v Speaker 2>is and she has all these things to do.</v>

232
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.194
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was vivid and powerful and </v>

233
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:19.893
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you hear me say something </v>

234
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:24.540
<v Speaker 2>like that as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a nonbeliever w,</v>

235
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.523
<v Speaker 2>what do you think of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's totally normal and totally </v>

236
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:28.954
<v Speaker 2>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think different people grieve in </v>

237
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:30.694
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it was when my grandfather </v>

238
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a similar experience.</v>

239
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:35.681
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

240
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a hyper vivid dream about him.</v>

241
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I think these moments in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

242
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:42.190
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really,</v>

243
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 2>they give you a kind of clarity </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

244
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:46.630
<v Speaker 2>but they also get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's,</v>

245
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 2>so for my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

246
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.353
<v Speaker 2>when he died and I was holding my dad's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand and his death and my mom seeing </v>

247
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:53.261
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her death.</v>

248
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:55.300
<v Speaker 2>So I was incredibly fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

249
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 2>they saw me into the world and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>them out of the world.</v>

250
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I was just irreconcilable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was just so,</v>

251
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I was a complete mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

252
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 2>And the woman who comes in and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social worker would have,</v>

253
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:08.321
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 2>normally we have grief counselors here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and normally I would suggest to say,</v>

255
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 2>but in your case I really think you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go see the grief counselor.</v>

256
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:22.051
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm sending supersede the grief </v>
<v Speaker 2>counselor in there is.</v>

257
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.583
<v Speaker 2>And I think part of that was so hard for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me is precisely because they don't have </v>

258
00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:29.170
<v Speaker 2>those metaphysical beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the finality.</v>

259
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see.</v>

260
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 2>So then did you have moments through </v>
<v Speaker 2>these?</v>

261
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.023
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you're saying you really didn't </v>

262
00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:37.720
<v Speaker 2>have a moment where suddenly you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I got this wrong or,</v>

263
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.170
<v Speaker 2>or I want to believe in something that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't prove,</v>

264
00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 2>but [inaudible] really it's really that </v>
<v Speaker 2>locked for you.</v>

265
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

266
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:46.804
<v Speaker 2>it's not locked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just never bartered my hope for </v>

267
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:49.211
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

268
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never as a great line.</v>

269
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was my hope for anything.</v>

270
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.450
<v Speaker 2>That's true though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I never,</v>

271
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.700
<v Speaker 2>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go through the long run.</v>

272
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 2>I was living in his house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driving,</v>

273
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:00.934
<v Speaker 2>his cars weren't as close because right </v>
<v Speaker 2>after we did the event with Christina </v>

274
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Hoff Summers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day that I went,</v>

275
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I went out there to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

276
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.100
<v Speaker 2>it was fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

277
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:11.520
<v Speaker 2>one thing that people really don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about,</v>

278
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I think the left and the right has their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own blind spots.</v>

279
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.973
<v Speaker 2>But parenting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am absolutely convinced is a </v>

280
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:22.390
<v Speaker 2>prophylactic to bad behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good parenting.</v>

281
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.733
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are more likely to commit violent </v>

282
00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 2>crimes if they're in a certain age </v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

283
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.063
<v Speaker 2>I just read this and I was reading Math </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thorton's manuscript above violence and </v>

284
00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:34.864
<v Speaker 2>if there are males and if there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>adult male president of the home and </v>

285
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.840
<v Speaker 2>just as the left doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge that and talk about that.</v>

286
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.740
<v Speaker 2>So too does the right have particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>blinders about structural inequality and</v>

287
00:14:44.741 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 2>such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think parenting and good parenting</v>

288
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 2>and being thoughtful and what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

289
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:50.920
<v Speaker 2>When I was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was driving down here,</v>

290
00:14:50.921 --> 00:14:52.910
<v Speaker 2>the Uber driver told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

291
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to mention what country </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was from and I'm looking at 50,000</v>

292
00:14:57.351 --> 00:14:59.240
<v Speaker 2>emails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people and,</v>

293
00:14:59.241 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 2>and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

294
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Can you pick a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me the same hemisphere.</v>

295
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Southeast Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

296
00:15:03.181 --> 00:15:04.014
<v Speaker 2>fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was telling me that they come from a </v>

297
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 2>traditional family and I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't your,</v>

298
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.590
<v Speaker 2>why don't your kids go to see your ex?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

299
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to spank them.</v>

300
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:15.603
<v Speaker 2>And I thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

301
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I've never raised my hand to my children</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

302
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.610
<v Speaker 2>I have raised my voice on occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never lost my temper.</v>

303
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't speak to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Denmark smacked me once or twice</v>

304
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 2>in an argument.</v>

305
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.840
<v Speaker 2>And more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the other thing.</v>

306
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 2>It's this idea about verbal violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea.</v>

307
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think parenting,</v>

308
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 2>I think we've overlooked how important </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>

309
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one more thing.</v>

310
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:40.124
<v Speaker 2>One thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since we're talking about this and </v>

311
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 2>planning on talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no plan here.</v>

312
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.110
<v Speaker 2>The nurse said something really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting to me.</v>

313
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:45.944
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you he was a wonderful father to </v>

314
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:50.090
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

315
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say that to everybody.</v>

316
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.461
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

317
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:53.294
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

318
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.253
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell by the way the kids treat </v>

319
00:15:55.971 --> 00:16:00.000
<v Speaker 2>their parents when they come to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital and this,</v>

320
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 2>it was so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would walk into this hospital every</v>

321
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:07.250
<v Speaker 2>day and I would see all these people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>were literally dying and they were alone</v>

322
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.653
<v Speaker 2>and they had nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just made me what kind of a </v>

323
00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:14.510
<v Speaker 2>loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

324
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the funny thing about not </v>

325
00:16:17.171 --> 00:16:22.171
<v Speaker 1>unbelief that you've so obviously had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent experience,</v>

326
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's all based in actually what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

327
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.550
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

328
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.310
<v Speaker 2>like I had a father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a physical person.</v>

329
00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:32.110
<v Speaker 2>He lived in my home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he raised me.</v>

330
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:32.981
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this a thing.</v>

331
00:16:32.981 --> 00:16:33.850
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

332
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.410
<v Speaker 2>so what did I do when my father died </v>
<v Speaker 2>after you know,</v>

333
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.363
<v Speaker 2>sobbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first person I called was my </v>

334
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:41.783
<v Speaker 2>childhood friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the next person who had known me </v>

335
00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:48.400
<v Speaker 2>for the longest time and he cheered me </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and it was good.</v>

336
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Or he tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.850
<v Speaker 1>that's connected to the family thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>

338
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:57.851
<v Speaker 1>I've mentioned this a couple of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>lately that I think now at 41 next week,</v>

339
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I just started to really understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

340
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:01.184
<v Speaker 1>I've started to understand why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family thing is so important and that </v>

341
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:05.624
<v Speaker 1>I'm so proud that my parents had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>married for 40 some odd years and I </v>

342
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:08.954
<v Speaker 1>still go home to the same childhood home</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my family friends are all still </v>

343
00:17:11.901 --> 00:17:12.630
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

344
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 1>my best friend in the world is still the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same guy that I met before kindergarten.</v>

345
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:20.120
<v Speaker 1>We were worried that those connections </v>
<v Speaker 1>have incredible value.</v>

346
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.520
<v Speaker 2>That's what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

347
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:23.660
<v Speaker 2>what is the meaning of life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

348
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:24.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

349
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:27.230
<v Speaker 2>you make the meaning life b.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Aristotle talks about that.</v>

350
00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:28.064
<v Speaker 2>And here's what I would throw out to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to the audiences that you can have </v>

351
00:17:32.331 --> 00:17:34.220
<v Speaker 2>the richest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deepest,</v>

352
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:35.054
<v Speaker 2>most rewarding friendships if you are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person of virtue and the person with </v>

353
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:41.420
<v Speaker 2>whom you're friends with is a person of </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtue.</v>

354
00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:42.254
<v Speaker 2>Aristotle says it's the highest form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>friendship between two virtuous people </v>

355
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.153
<v Speaker 2>and what does that entail?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it really does until it kind of </v>

356
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Greek cop parrishcea speaking truth in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the face of danger.</v>

357
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.333
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've told you a few things and </v>

358
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:55.320
<v Speaker 2>you've told me a few things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

359
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I think you're wrong about this or have </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

360
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.600
<v Speaker 2>And if that is sufficient to decide that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to part ways,</v>

361
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:05.310
<v Speaker 2>then either our friendship wasn't that </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong and the first place.</v>

362
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.263
<v Speaker 2>Or I would like to think that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of relationship that we can be </v>

363
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:11.394
<v Speaker 2>completely honest with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even really I wouldn't spare your </v>

364
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:14.724
<v Speaker 2>feelings about something frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you and I exactly what </v>

365
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:18.324
<v Speaker 2>true French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would expect that you would </v>

366
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:20.964
<v Speaker 2>expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't spare your feelings and I </v>

367
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 2>would just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look man,</v>

368
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 2>this is how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did this and I have to say,</v>

369
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.430
<v Speaker 2>and then whatever it was I was telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>you about this right before we started.</v>

370
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:30.264
<v Speaker 2>So without even saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sex or name of the person certainly </v>

371
00:18:32.371 --> 00:18:34.670
<v Speaker 2>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got into a bit of a,</v>

372
00:18:34.671 --> 00:18:35.504
<v Speaker 2>an argument with a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a public person just yesterday and we </v>

373
00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:40.134
<v Speaker 2>really got into it on the phone and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>made it clear and I've done this a </v>

374
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:45.024
<v Speaker 2>couple times lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made it clear with people that even if </v>

375
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:50.700
<v Speaker 2>we're apoplectically angry at each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

376
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.640
<v Speaker 2>this is not going to end the friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for me.</v>

377
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel very,</v>

378
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.480
<v Speaker 2>that comes very easy for me to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

379
00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.453
<v Speaker 2>it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know why that's so hard for </v>

380
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:02.994
<v Speaker 2>other people to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so now willing and maybe it is a </v>

381
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:05.424
<v Speaker 2>social media thing in a short attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>span thing or something like we're so </v>

382
00:19:08.521 --> 00:19:09.354
<v Speaker 2>willing to just shred things that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>had yet lends itself to a really </v>

383
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 2>interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would be,</v>

384
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.760
<v Speaker 2>since we're talking personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I may,</v>

385
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 2>what would be a deal breaker for </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship?</v>

386
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:25.460
<v Speaker 2>And I was at dinner with my family a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago and my son,</v>

387
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:27.170
<v Speaker 2>you've met my son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

388
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I junior kid almost always keep my </v>
<v Speaker 2>family's names.</v>

389
00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:30.804
<v Speaker 2>And so far it started talking about one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things you've learning about in </v>

390
00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:37.620
<v Speaker 2>school is gender and social constructs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sex changes.</v>

391
00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:41.940
<v Speaker 2>And he said to my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if dad decided to become a woman,</v>

392
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.950
<v Speaker 2>would you still be married to him?</v>

393
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 2>And my wife without an instance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hesitation said no.</v>

394
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.170
<v Speaker 2>And both my children were flabbergasted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they couldn't.</v>

395
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.063
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they kept pressing her and she </v>

396
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:54.871
<v Speaker 2>said basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

397
00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:59.100
<v Speaker 2>this isn't what I signed up for and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just made me think.</v>

398
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.143
<v Speaker 2>So what are the limits of friendship?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what would the limits of </v>

399
00:20:02.731 --> 00:20:05.370
<v Speaker 2>friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can think of a few things.</v>

400
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.773
<v Speaker 2>Well if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I found out that you murdered </v>

401
00:20:08.101 --> 00:20:08.934
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a cold blooded murderer or you </v>

402
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:14.270
<v Speaker 2>had done something so duplicitous </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly related to me too,</v>

403
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 2>or even even I would have made me even </v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone else.</v>

404
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Or I'm in Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

405
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:19.860
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't make a scale like,</v>

406
00:20:19.861 --> 00:20:20.694
<v Speaker 2>but what if I started filling my pockets</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in the kitchen with grapes </v>

407
00:20:22.741 --> 00:20:24.390
<v Speaker 2>and that I saw in the fray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

408
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.233
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you you could have anything out </v>

409
00:20:25.531 --> 00:20:25.650
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

410
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.500
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know right now.</v>

411
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.190
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing is we'd have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

412
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I didn't ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

413
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I take it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

414
00:20:30.941 --> 00:20:33.600
<v Speaker 2>so like what if I went into your bedroom</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were gone and went through your</v>

415
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:35.040
<v Speaker 2>drugs like there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

416
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.470
<v Speaker 2>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what those limits are,</v>

417
00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.560
<v Speaker 2>are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would,</v>

418
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:41.483
<v Speaker 2>I suggest that it really comes down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtue and trust and those sorts of </v>

419
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 2>relationships give your life so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning and are so fulfilling and are so</v>

420
00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:53.200
<v Speaker 2>profound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make for a life worth living.</v>

421
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.203
<v Speaker 2>And Nat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what we need to put front and </v>

422
00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 2>center in our lives and even that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>on addiction is fascinating.</v>

423
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rice addiction medicine doctor.</v>

424
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:08.251
<v Speaker 2>And she gave this really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>presentation about how one of the,</v>

425
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:13.470
<v Speaker 2>the reasons that people become and stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>addicts and all the studies,</v>

426
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 2>and this is the art of my area of </v>
<v Speaker 2>expertise,</v>

427
00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:16.684
<v Speaker 2>but basically these does these studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>on rad parks and when rats are given </v>

428
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:25.210
<v Speaker 2>wheels and fun thing or habit trails </v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever wraps,</v>

429
00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:29.560
<v Speaker 2>like they're much less likely to choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcotics then if they're not.</v>

430
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.323
<v Speaker 2>And one of those things is these </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships that we develop and we </v>

431
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:34.744
<v Speaker 2>nurture throughout our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess I would like to be the sort </v>

432
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:38.764
<v Speaker 2>of person for whom being a person of </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity and virtue and having those </v>

433
00:21:44.651 --> 00:21:49.651
<v Speaker 2>deeply fulfilling relationships enhances</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life and my friendship.</v>

434
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.180
<v Speaker 2>And then when you call me and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

435
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 2>this is up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for that,</v>

436
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate you did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was as a massive dick move.</v>

437
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>

438
00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.493
<v Speaker 2>So I know we've talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've definitely talked about this </v>

439
00:22:00.881 --> 00:22:01.714
<v Speaker 2>privately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we may have talked about it </v>

440
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.303
<v Speaker 2>last time also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it'd be good to recharge if </v>

441
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:05.344
<v Speaker 2>someone does exactly what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find that virtuous life but needs to do </v>

442
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:13.330
<v Speaker 2>it through belief but does the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

443
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that is somehow still </v>
<v Speaker 2>an inherent problem with,</v>

444
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:21.160
<v Speaker 2>with the proper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the proper way to be a human,</v>

445
00:22:21.161 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Speaker 2>but just well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem then if somebody does</v>

446
00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

447
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there,</v>

448
00:22:25.371 --> 00:22:30.250
<v Speaker 2>there are two to two issues with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is what's the problem?</v>

449
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Does that cause a problem with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to somebody?</v>

450
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:38.550
<v Speaker 2>So I have a friend who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only is he a hardcore Christian,</v>

451
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:42.890
<v Speaker 2>he writes children's books trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>indoctrinate people into Christian.</v>

452
00:22:42.891 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Phil Vischer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy from veggies,</v>

453
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Veggie Tales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just be on very good friend of mine,</v>

454
00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.773
<v Speaker 2>Alex and such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this shows you can be friends with </v>

455
00:22:49.151 --> 00:22:49.984
<v Speaker 2>some you can and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've confided in her about things </v>

456
00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:56.830
<v Speaker 2>and I trust him and I have told him in </v>
<v Speaker 2>no uncertain terms,</v>

457
00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:59.630
<v Speaker 2>I think he's harboring a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a misconception,</v>

458
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.720
<v Speaker 2>but delusion about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

459
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.710
<v Speaker 2>And we've had a civil talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one threw fisticuffs Nolan.</v>

460
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.160
<v Speaker 2>We talk about that in the context of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendship,</v>

461
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.410
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't sufficient for him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>end the Pie.</v>

462
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.263
<v Speaker 2>Never had any idea where we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the side that wasn't sufficient </v>

463
00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:20.920
<v Speaker 2>for him to withdraw from the friendship </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the friendship.</v>

464
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.173
<v Speaker 2>And that's a core belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's an antithetical belief to </v>

465
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.643
<v Speaker 2>what I've devoted my professional life </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to helping people think clearly and </v>

466
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:30.364
<v Speaker 2>critically and overthrow Dogma and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology and morally motivated </v>

467
00:23:33.281 --> 00:23:35.320
<v Speaker 2>reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the problem,</v>

468
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:40.540
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that is it depends on </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want to have,</v>

469
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:42.280
<v Speaker 2>what your relationship to truth wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

470
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 2>what you think it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There would be something to me if,</v>

471
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.320
<v Speaker 2>if somebody was friends with me and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine friend in a virtuous friend,</v>

472
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.260
<v Speaker 2>only because they feared that if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would not do that,</v>

473
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 2>they would go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There would be something suspect in that</v>

474
00:23:57.741 --> 00:23:59.870
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what or who wasn't that?</v>

475
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:02.210
<v Speaker 2>What if they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just had some belief that,</v>

476
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever it is.</v>

477
00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Or they just had some belief that Karma </v>
<v Speaker 2>prove our car.</v>

478
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

479
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.141
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Karma is a great,</v>

480
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:10.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just believed in Karma.</v>

481
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.953
<v Speaker 2>What they're going to put out there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to come back to them because of </v>

482
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:18.410
<v Speaker 2>that they become the virtuous type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that you aspire to be.</v>

483
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.170
<v Speaker 2>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

484
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.003
<v Speaker 2>it's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've shifted my stance on that </v>

485
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:22.933
<v Speaker 2>over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess I'm having trouble with the </v>

486
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:26.744
<v Speaker 2>question because I don't really think </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone can truly be virtuous if they </v>

487
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Speaker 2>harbor beliefs based on a faulty </v>
<v Speaker 2>epistemology.</v>

488
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could sort of get lost,</v>

489
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 2>but my definition of virtue then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just say that's the case.</v>

490
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.813
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would the world would be better off in </v>

491
00:24:43.461 --> 00:24:44.294
<v Speaker 2>human flourishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be contributed to if more people </v>

492
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:51.281
<v Speaker 2>had this false belief of view than if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>resorted to this hub Sian state?</v>

493
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

494
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the problem would be,</v>

495
00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:57.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they alone believe that and didn't </v>

496
00:24:59.241 --> 00:25:01.700
<v Speaker 2>try to institutionalize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be,</v>

497
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.563
<v Speaker 2>it would be less of a problem than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have said even two or three years </v>

498
00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:06.920
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

499
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think perhaps,</v>

500
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:09.523
<v Speaker 2>and I'll watch the video again myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you might've answered that a </v>

501
00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:14.000
<v Speaker 2>little bit differently and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which shows a flexible mind.</v>

502
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever fear that as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a public person,</v>

503
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 2>you say things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tweet,</v>

504
00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 2>things you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews,</v>

505
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:19.184
<v Speaker 2>you go on podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things that people are gonna </v>

506
00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:20.810
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

507
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.290
<v Speaker 2>you see he two years ago he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else and it's like,</v>

508
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:26.120
<v Speaker 2>they just want to get you so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

509
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:28.420
<v Speaker 2>that should what we really need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

510
00:25:28.421 --> 00:25:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that should be a virtue.</v>

511
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.840
<v Speaker 2>It should be a virtue that you change </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

512
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:35.720
<v Speaker 2>I will admit it's hard for me to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

513
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:36.583
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult when you're constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>under attack and constantly under siege </v>

514
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.920
<v Speaker 2>to say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's far more difficult.</v>

515
00:25:42.921 --> 00:25:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Not only to say I made a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

516
00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really thought about this and then you</v>

517
00:25:46.341 --> 00:25:47.174
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I've stopped reading my </v>

518
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:49.460
<v Speaker 2>twitter mentions or facebook and none of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

519
00:25:49.461 --> 00:25:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't read any of it anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just so filled with hate and rage.</v>

520
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.780
<v Speaker 2>And even if you look at the terms we </v>
<v Speaker 2>use,</v>

521
00:25:56.781 --> 00:25:59.720
<v Speaker 2>the moral valence to terms have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>flip flopping,</v>

522
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.290
<v Speaker 2>flip flopping is a negative thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you change your mind,</v>

523
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:04.124
<v Speaker 2>but you should change your mind if your </v>
<v Speaker 2>commander in chief and the situation on </v>

524
00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:09.650
<v Speaker 2>the ground changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have access to that.</v>

525
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.693
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he flip flop about troops in Iraq or </v>

526
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:13.220
<v Speaker 2>bunk Guantanamo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

527
00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:18.170
<v Speaker 2>we live in a dynamic world where things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in flux and they change.</v>

528
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 2>But I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have found,</v>

529
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.853
<v Speaker 2>I have definitely found that being that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of person who's not willing to </v>

530
00:26:27.651 --> 00:26:28.484
<v Speaker 2>change my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the open open admission of that on </v>

531
00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:32.654
<v Speaker 2>twitter or facebook has become more </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult as people ramp up their </v>

532
00:26:36.951 --> 00:26:39.040
<v Speaker 2>personal slanders and attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

533
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very aware of that,</v>

534
00:26:41.421 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Speaker 2>that I'm dying to talk to you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

535
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

536
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Diana talked to you about what's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with you.</v>

537
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I've had some strange things going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get there in just one second.</v>

538
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 1>You also had another that sort of attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>on you who sort of similar to what I had</v>

539
00:26:55.081 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 1>on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

540
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're really onto something</v>
<v Speaker 1>there that I don't think it's,</v>

541
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 1>if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:27:00.271 --> 00:27:01.290
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

543
00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:02.690
<v Speaker 1>you said this three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

544
00:27:02.691 --> 00:27:05.100
<v Speaker 1>you used to believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll look at some of my tweets when I</v>

545
00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 1>was a far left progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

546
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.420
<v Speaker 1>And look what used to make fun of white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people for this.</v>

547
00:27:09.421 --> 00:27:10.201
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

548
00:27:10.201 --> 00:27:13.110
<v Speaker 1>you're not proving me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you trying to prove?</v>

549
00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:14.810
<v Speaker 1>You're proving that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I evolved.</v>

550
00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.710
<v Speaker 1>He's changed your mind and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

551
00:27:16.711 --> 00:27:19.930
<v Speaker 1>this guy had tooken information and as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>result isn't there,</v>

552
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.320
<v Speaker 1>but you're rational people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

553
00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.370
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're supposed to do.</v>

554
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 1>But you're also right about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other point,</v>

555
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:27.450
<v Speaker 1>which is that when you're under attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>from people,</v>

556
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:28.284
<v Speaker 1>when you feel like everything you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say is that then you stop </v>

557
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.700
<v Speaker 1>having those nice moments of mayor </v>
<v Speaker 1>culpas contrition.</v>

558
00:27:34.701 --> 00:27:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

559
00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.960
<v Speaker 2>You know what else you stop doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is interesting.</v>

560
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:37.853
<v Speaker 2>You stop asking questions and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you might ask the questions </v>

561
00:27:42.241 --> 00:27:43.740
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

562
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.293
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to articulate those </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions or you don't want to </v>

563
00:27:47.581 --> 00:27:50.040
<v Speaker 2>articulate those rebuttals because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

564
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.903
<v Speaker 2>you really don't want to receive 500 </v>
<v Speaker 2>emails and shift through all of the </v>

565
00:27:53.101 --> 00:27:53.934
<v Speaker 2>telling you you're a shithead and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should go die and kill yourself and </v>

566
00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.610
<v Speaker 2>people write in your name and the walls </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a Nazi.</v>

567
00:27:58.611 --> 00:28:00.600
<v Speaker 2>They see you stopped doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

568
00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:01.434
<v Speaker 2>like give an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was this film I was in with Michael </v>

569
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Shermer reasons to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I made a comment about a pussy hats.</v>

570
00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 2>These people having pussy ass and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it makes it look like we,</v>

571
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.380
<v Speaker 2>this is not the image you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>portray.</v>

572
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 2>And someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an unbelievable amount of,</v>

573
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.083
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

574
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:21.540
<v Speaker 2>just crazy target about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things I thought was,</v>

575
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.173
<v Speaker 2>I almost said I came so close to saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think Martin Luther King would </v>

576
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.930
<v Speaker 2>have been more respected or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>respected if he had a pussy hat on?</v>

577
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.943
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would've been the perfect thing to </v>

578
00:28:35.611 --> 00:28:36.444
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't say it because I didn't </v>

579
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:40.620
<v Speaker 2>want hundreds of emails and tweets about</v>
<v Speaker 2>me being a racist.</v>

580
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 2>So I think we're in a precarious </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation right now.</v>

581
00:28:46.231 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think Sam is getting this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts,</v>

582
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 2>asking questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opening conversations.</v>

583
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.140
<v Speaker 2>We need to have those conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need,</v>

584
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I need</v>

585
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.530
<v Speaker 1>to ask those questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about Sam Harris just,</v>

586
00:28:57.531 --> 00:28:58.364
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Ash,</v>

587
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had Charles Murray on even Gary Tobbs,</v>

588
00:29:01.431 --> 00:29:03.800
<v Speaker 1>the guy who the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anti sugar guy.</v>

589
00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.813
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do then if you were in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>position or in Santa this position when </v>

590
00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I see some articles written about </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance and,</v>

591
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.083
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruben talked to this guy or this guy or </v>

592
00:29:12.471 --> 00:29:16.190
<v Speaker 1>this gal and they think this and Ruben </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't ask them this and all this stuff.</v>

593
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.260
<v Speaker 1>So Sam gets to this too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

594
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vox did a really hatchet job.</v>

595
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.960
<v Speaker 1>It misrepresents what him and Charles </v>
<v Speaker 1>Murray talked about,</v>

596
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.800
<v Speaker 1>how long a hit pieces and write and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>slate.</v>

597
00:29:27.801 --> 00:29:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Just wrote something about you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about the conceptual penis</v>

598
00:29:30.681 --> 00:29:33.290
<v Speaker 1>shortly and what happened with with </v>
<v Speaker 1>salon,</v>

599
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.393
<v Speaker 1>but all of those things they add up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us not having any more conversation </v>

600
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.460
<v Speaker 1>because at some point it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

601
00:29:40.461 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 1>well then I'll just yet</v>

602
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll just talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I'll talk to people that I</v>

603
00:29:44.041 --> 00:29:44.874
<v Speaker 2>agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just talk to people who say </v>

604
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:46.390
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

605
00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Because then I've completely insulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

606
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no,</v>

607
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 2>it'll really show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

608
00:29:50.951 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what we need to do.</v>

609
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to figure out everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Lindsey actually gave me this idea</v>

610
00:29:57.341 --> 00:30:00.490
<v Speaker 2>and I think he's absolutely right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a coauthor of the conceptual penis,</v>

611
00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:01.324
<v Speaker 2>a social contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to figure out whose voice </v>

612
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:04.084
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certain people matter and in general </v>

613
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:13.321
<v Speaker 2>this hate and vitriol comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>least accomplished people who in need.</v>

614
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 2>There's a really nice niche in frame to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about this there.</v>

615
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.610
<v Speaker 2>They viewed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of an oversimplified but,</v>

616
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.080
<v Speaker 2>but their slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their situation,</v>

617
00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 2>reality is their slaves and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>discharge these primal urges on people.</v>

618
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Australians have this term</v>
<v Speaker 2>tall poppy syndrome.</v>

619
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:31.980
<v Speaker 2>When it's something gross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

620
00:30:31.981 --> 00:30:32.814
<v Speaker 2>you just cut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as Ruben grows and subscribers and </v>

621
00:30:35.091 --> 00:30:36.550
<v Speaker 2>that's where if I could just cut reuben </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

622
00:30:36.551 --> 00:30:37.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck them.</v>

623
00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:40.810
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of that Nazi white supremacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobia.</v>

624
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 2>So we gay marriage you Nazi homophobe </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

625
00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.203
<v Speaker 2>I know it's overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to figure out whose voices </v>

626
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:53.290
<v Speaker 2>matter and then we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to have those friendships,</v>

627
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:54.124
<v Speaker 2>a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people come to us and say </v>

628
00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:56.380
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can really listen.</v>

629
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.393
<v Speaker 2>But the way to not do it is to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you've said repeatedly to look at an </v>

630
00:31:00.761 --> 00:31:01.594
<v Speaker 2>egg on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a 12 year old in their </v>

631
00:31:03.521 --> 00:31:04.354
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just can't take those voices </v>

632
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:07.300
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

633
00:31:07.301 --> 00:31:10.470
<v Speaker 2>So sort of couched around everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about so far is,</v>

634
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.363
<v Speaker 2>is sort of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That tactics that some people use to be </v>

635
00:31:14.741 --> 00:31:17.470
<v Speaker 2>involved in a conversation and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motives that we have,</v>

636
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.370
<v Speaker 2>whether it be because you're a believer </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a nonbeliever,</v>

637
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:20.920
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>

638
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.753
<v Speaker 2>I've come to a place where I think right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now in 2017 we're in a strange spot </v>

639
00:31:25.721 --> 00:31:26.554
<v Speaker 2>where the fascinating the institutions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that used to help us keep some of this </v>

640
00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:32.580
<v Speaker 2>stuff in the lanes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

641
00:31:32.581 --> 00:31:34.450
<v Speaker 2>what is acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's not acceptable,</v>

642
00:31:34.451 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 2>what's right and wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's real and not real.</v>

643
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these institutions are crumbling.</v>

644
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:41.650
<v Speaker 2>And by that I mean that media is </v>
<v Speaker 2>crumbling.</v>

645
00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Our political institutions seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>crying gimmick institution.</v>

646
00:31:45.351 --> 00:31:47.170
<v Speaker 2>So that's the one I really want to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into with you.</v>

647
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.273
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things are starting to </v>

648
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:51.574
<v Speaker 2>crumble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's partly because information has </v>

649
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:53.494
<v Speaker 2>changed so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that even worse than </v>

650
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 2>crumble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you would say they're,</v>

651
00:31:56.711 --> 00:31:58.990
<v Speaker 2>they're decimated already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

652
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.960
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that the academy,</v>

653
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 2>certain sections of the Academy of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sciences I think are doing very,</v>

654
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The humanities are in shambles.</v>

655
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Certain departments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything tainted by Postmodernism,</v>

656
00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.780
<v Speaker 2>particularly gender studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conceptual penis.</v>

657
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's pause for a sec.</v>

658
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just go to the conceptual penis as</v>

659
00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:20.710
<v Speaker 2>a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a social construct,</v>

660
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:21.563
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wrote a hoax paper with James </v>

661
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Lindsey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

662
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 2>And you got this publish and we thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was extremely funny.</v>

663
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read it,</v>

664
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:31.250
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

665
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:35.560
<v Speaker 2>it's jaw droppingly ridiculous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>argued for climate change,</v>

666
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being responsible.</v>

667
00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.200
<v Speaker 2>The conceptual penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

668
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a satire,</v>

669
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 2>sort of the main takeaway of it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the penis is not really a real thing.</v>

670
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:48.131
<v Speaker 2>It's just this sort of a morphis idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we threw in a lot of moral jargon.</v>

671
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:51.170
<v Speaker 2>We throw in what we appeal to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral sensibilities.</v>

672
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why Pete,</v>

673
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.640
<v Speaker 2>you're an academic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you write a hoax paper?</v>

674
00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Why would you mark the very institutions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of which you are?</v>

675
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>departments in the universities that are</v>

676
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:06.770
<v Speaker 2>making a mockery of our institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you said crumbling,</v>

677
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's right.</v>

678
00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:10.463
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

679
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.660
<v Speaker 2>that's not the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have used other words.</v>

680
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:13.533
<v Speaker 2>It's accurate in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these people are fabricating not </v>

681
00:33:17.021 --> 00:33:17.854
<v Speaker 2>only their own knowledge bases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're writing things in journals that </v>

682
00:33:20.501 --> 00:33:25.501
<v Speaker 2>they then site that becomes knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have their manufacturing ideas that</v>

683
00:33:26.621 --> 00:33:30.070
<v Speaker 2>are totally untethered to reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how crazy this is.</v>

684
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.960
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so look,</v>

685
00:33:31.961 --> 00:33:33.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna try explaining this.</v>

686
00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:34.444
<v Speaker 2>You reel me in if this is unclear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is idea is so crazy that </v>

687
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:41.260
<v Speaker 2>anybody listening to this exam that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't possibly like this,</v>

688
00:33:41.261 --> 00:33:42.094
<v Speaker 2>this can't possibly be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the idea and then I'm going </v>

689
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:45.044
<v Speaker 2>to give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asking me what belief I'm going </v>

690
00:33:46.241 --> 00:33:49.180
<v Speaker 2>to give you an analog and theology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

691
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.283
<v Speaker 2>So what these people do is that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have moral intuitions based upon is </v>

692
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.030
<v Speaker 2>thought basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get to that in a second.</v>

693
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:06.450
<v Speaker 2>So what they do to justify this is they </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacture their own epistemology,</v>

694
00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.920
<v Speaker 2>their own way to know that justifies the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions that they have.</v>

695
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.530
<v Speaker 2>So then they can go out and become </v>
<v Speaker 2>activists.</v>

696
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick detour.</v>

697
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

698
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:19.340
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

699
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.173
<v Speaker 2>Biggest problems facing the left right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now is anybody who calls out a bad idea </v>

700
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.320
<v Speaker 2>is viewed as somebody on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to stop that.</v>

701
00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I know a little something about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

702
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:34.280
<v Speaker 2>a little something about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

703
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:35.840
<v Speaker 2>a lot about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

704
00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you an analogy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>theology.</v>

705
00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:41.510
<v Speaker 2>So this Guy Alvin Plantinga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a Christian philosopher.</v>

706
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:46.490
<v Speaker 2>So he has these beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

707
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:48.103
<v Speaker 2>they're actually more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their claims about reality and about </v>

708
00:34:50.001 --> 00:34:50.834
<v Speaker 2>Jesus being the son of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he realizes that there's no evidence </v>

709
00:34:53.781 --> 00:34:56.090
<v Speaker 2>they can take them there usually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does he do?</v>

710
00:34:56.091 --> 00:34:58.760
<v Speaker 2>He manufactured his own epistemology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

711
00:34:58.761 --> 00:34:59.331
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

712
00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:00.164
<v Speaker 2>we're going to say that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing called the God center and the God </v>

713
00:35:02.571 --> 00:35:04.700
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people have it and it allows you to</v>

714
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:09.140
<v Speaker 2>just as I apprehend the color red,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to do I apprehend God.</v>

715
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.003
<v Speaker 2>So he makes an epistemology to justify </v>
<v Speaker 2>these insane claims about the nature of </v>

716
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.450
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just as he has done that</v>

717
00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:22.390
<v Speaker 2>critical theory is that epistemology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is used,</v>

718
00:35:22.391 --> 00:35:25.900
<v Speaker 2>and I can explain that is complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid we're gonna lose people.</v>

719
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:28.060
<v Speaker 2>We got a lot of terms we've got to throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

720
00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:28.923
<v Speaker 2>It's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I would like to attempt to do </v>

721
00:35:31.121 --> 00:35:31.954
<v Speaker 2>in this segment is to link the madness </v>
<v Speaker 2>on campuses right now to the </v>

722
00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:38.790
<v Speaker 2>intellectual engines driving that </v>
<v Speaker 2>madness.</v>

723
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.113
<v Speaker 2>And the make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These departments tainted by </v>

724
00:35:45.211 --> 00:35:49.620
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism are absolutely filled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>zealots and morally motivated.</v>

725
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:50.454
<v Speaker 2>Either ideologues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do a little catch up so that in </v>

726
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:54.900
<v Speaker 2>case anyone's missing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first let's,</v>

727
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.410
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about what is postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

728
00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.620
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most knows that,</v>

729
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:00.450
<v Speaker 2>but let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just do a couple of definitions.</v>

730
00:36:00.451 --> 00:36:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Quicks okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's do the definition.</v>

731
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

732
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:11.120
<v Speaker 2>so the Frankfurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankfurt school has this idea of,</v>

733
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.990
<v Speaker 2>well that's even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back for it.</v>

734
00:36:12.991 --> 00:36:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to Karl Marx.</v>

735
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Karl Marx was a philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

736
00:36:16.771 --> 00:36:19.650
<v Speaker 2>here's a bonus question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did Hitler hate call marks?</v>

737
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's a good punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

738
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:23.910
<v Speaker 2>it's not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually true cause he was a Jew.</v>

739
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Jews touched where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but otherwise they are great guy.</v>

740
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:28.921
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

741
00:36:28.921 --> 00:36:29.810
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

742
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:31.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

743
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:32.544
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so mark's Marxist economics and these </v>

744
00:36:37.441 --> 00:36:38.274
<v Speaker 2>people aren't Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more Marxian would be a better </v>

745
00:36:40.171 --> 00:36:42.810
<v Speaker 2>term marks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Economics looks at the world in terms of</v>

746
00:36:42.811 --> 00:36:45.330
<v Speaker 2>economical pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their oppressor classes,</v>

747
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:50.250
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have,</v>

748
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.100
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll get to the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern postmodernism.</v>

749
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:53.963
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as simple and complicated should </v>

750
00:36:55.801 --> 00:36:56.634
<v Speaker 2>they've taken this idea of these Marxian</v>
<v Speaker 2>notions of oppressor classes and looked </v>

751
00:37:02.161 --> 00:37:07.161
<v Speaker 2>at them in terms of gender and race and </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

752
00:37:07.321 --> 00:37:08.154
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they have hierarchically </v>

753
00:37:10.741 --> 00:37:15.120
<v Speaker 2>prioritized people within that list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Patriarchy is white,</v>

754
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.920
<v Speaker 2>heterosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cisgendered,</v>

755
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:18.540
<v Speaker 2>which is a thing males.</v>

756
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:22.070
<v Speaker 2>And they want it at the top of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a bank.</v>

757
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

758
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.880
<v Speaker 2>But that's the other thing they do just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like religion,</v>

759
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:29.250
<v Speaker 2>they have their own defense mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what they say.</v>

760
00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't criticize it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a CIS gendered,</v>

761
00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:32.514
<v Speaker 2>white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heterosexual male and and is the </v>

762
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:38.610
<v Speaker 2>ultimate irony of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is prejudice.</v>

763
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.560
<v Speaker 2>That is prejudging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

764
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.670
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

765
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.120
<v Speaker 2>I then sit here and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

766
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aigner but cozy in a white,</v>

767
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:47.514
<v Speaker 2>straight CIS gendered male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we judge you based on your immutable </v>

768
00:37:51.211 --> 00:37:52.030
<v Speaker 2>characteristic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

769
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.863
<v Speaker 2>So this is indispensable to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are using words based upon </v>

770
00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:02.040
<v Speaker 2>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary definition.</v>

771
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:03.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example some more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

772
00:38:03.151 --> 00:38:03.984
<v Speaker 2>so when you use racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the way I use most people who </v>

773
00:38:07.171 --> 00:38:08.004
<v Speaker 2>aren't in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been indoctrinated by gender </v>

774
00:38:09.781 --> 00:38:10.614
<v Speaker 2>studies and the postmodern left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea that you do not judge </v>

775
00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:14.514
<v Speaker 2>people particularly negatively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't make judgments about </v>

776
00:38:15.901 --> 00:38:18.690
<v Speaker 2>people based upon an immutable </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic like their skin color.</v>

777
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:22.800
<v Speaker 2>But they've changed that definition to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it systemic racism.</v>

778
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.650
<v Speaker 2>They've changed that definite definition</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put in,</v>

779
00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a power vector,</v>

780
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:31.170
<v Speaker 2>that hierarchical power vector that only</v>
<v Speaker 2>flows one way.</v>

781
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:35.770
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this blacks cannot be racist whites,</v>

782
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 2>so they have snuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very sneaky.</v>

783
00:38:38.471 --> 00:38:42.050
<v Speaker 2>They've taken a normal word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>added a,</v>

784
00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:42.840
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

785
00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.330
<v Speaker 2>a moral component to it and change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of a word.</v>

786
00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:47.191
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

787
00:38:47.191 --> 00:38:48.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's some,</v>

788
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.350
<v Speaker 2>if I may give you some more examples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

789
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equality.</v>

790
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:53.583
<v Speaker 2>Equality is a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've shifted from a quality to </v>

791
00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:58.000
<v Speaker 2>equity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what does equity mean?</v>

792
00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Equity means where we need a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people,</v>

793
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.360
<v Speaker 2>representative of the general population</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 17% African Americans.</v>

794
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:07.810
<v Speaker 2>We need to have 17% but the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that,</v>

795
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.273
<v Speaker 2>that they also want to take in to </v>
<v Speaker 2>account historical discrimination and a </v>

796
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.150
<v Speaker 2>kind of reparations for that.</v>

797
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.100
<v Speaker 2>So those numbers are even higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

798
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.113
<v Speaker 2>I think it can be summarized in Ruth </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bader Ginsburg's quip or joke or </v>

799
00:39:23.621 --> 00:39:25.080
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many few females,</v>

800
00:39:25.081 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Supreme Court justices do you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be nine.</v>

801
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:29.643
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that we want equal </v>

802
00:39:32.561 --> 00:39:37.561
<v Speaker 2>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want more because of past injustices.</v>

803
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is this get,</v>

804
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.100
<v Speaker 2>we got to talk about deconstruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to talk about violence.</v>

805
00:39:45.101 --> 00:39:45.934
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about why all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you understand them from this </v>

806
00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:50.134
<v Speaker 2>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all coming from the same school </v>

807
00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:55.080
<v Speaker 2>of thought effected by critical theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the most inelegant,</v>

808
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:56.430
<v Speaker 2>let's define critical theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

809
00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:01.120
<v Speaker 2>So critical theory is this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

810
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:02.603
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that traditional power dynamics and </v>

811
00:40:07.241 --> 00:40:09.160
<v Speaker 2>traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is oversimplified,</v>

812
00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:09.994
<v Speaker 2>but it's a general idea from which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can have a starting point for a </v>

813
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:13.910
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

814
00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.280
<v Speaker 2>that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought to myself,</v>

815
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get 500 emails and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>

816
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:20.360
<v Speaker 2>and it makes me again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

817
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:23.680
<v Speaker 2>it makes me self sensor and then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like come on.</v>

818
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:24.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

819
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:26.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real,</v>

820
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get lost in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a real thing.</v>

821
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:28.924
<v Speaker 1>I mean I find it for myself to know is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to talk broadly about things </v>

822
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 1>because I want to communicate big ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully people will then read some</v>

823
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:35.764
<v Speaker 1>books or watched some other videos or </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow some other people on twitter or </v>

824
00:40:38.651 --> 00:40:40.150
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then even if you talk about,</v>

825
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.310
<v Speaker 1>well he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

826
00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wept over that.</v>

827
00:40:42.521 --> 00:40:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or he didn't know that.</v>

828
00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:44.274
<v Speaker 1>So why didn't you talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankfurt school like quick you didn't </v>

829
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:48.220
<v Speaker 1>mention Horkheimer wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing over.</v>

830
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:50.370
<v Speaker 1>All these guys are let guys know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

831
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.213
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just get to a point where all of </v>

832
00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:55.090
<v Speaker 1>that stuff just centering essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

833
00:40:55.091 --> 00:40:59.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not dementia is the message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for you.</v>

834
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:01.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for,</v>

835
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:02.981
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

836
00:41:02.981 --> 00:41:03.814
<v Speaker 1>that's why I mentioned the think was </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient and I think that was an </v>

837
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:08.583
<v Speaker 1>acquisition right now if you think for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you are not afraid to buck </v>

838
00:41:11.981 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will come to get you.</v>

839
00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about so critical theory.</v>

840
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:18.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's the idea</v>

841
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.550
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

842
00:41:21.551 --> 00:41:22.384
<v Speaker 2>it's basically a Marxist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea that there are these </v>

843
00:41:25.811 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 2>entrenched power structures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrenched power dynamics.</v>

844
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.113
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that we need to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is we need to recognize these and then </v>

845
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 2>we need to overthrow the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to deconstruct these traditional</v>

846
00:41:36.801 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies to make society more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

847
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 2>More equitable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fair,</v>

848
00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 2>more what did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

849
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these kids protesting at evergreen or</v>

850
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:49.064
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't just x Niello just get this </v>

851
00:41:50.421 --> 00:41:52.530
<v Speaker 2>idea that they just gonna it just does </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

852
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get this.</v>

853
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.333
<v Speaker 2>These are coming out of specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>departments in the university and when </v>

854
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:01.760
<v Speaker 2>they're asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you do this?</v>

855
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 2>So what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They they talk,</v>

856
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.800
<v Speaker 2>well my professor said this and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>

857
00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:09.020
<v Speaker 2>the insane part that gets back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptual penis again.</v>

858
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.800
<v Speaker 2>That these people have their own lines </v>
<v Speaker 2>of literature.</v>

859
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.260
<v Speaker 2>That is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are intellectual cesspools to have</v>

860
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.560
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

861
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:24.850
<v Speaker 2>so they have their tags that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufactured what they think.</v>

862
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 2>That's why they have to like with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural appropriation,</v>

863
00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:33.870
<v Speaker 2>they have to import ideas like power </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't it,</v>

864
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.843
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is made up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely fabricated because they </v>

865
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:39.710
<v Speaker 2>want to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to overthrow these traditional</v>

866
00:42:39.711 --> 00:42:40.544
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these kids get this idea from their </v>

867
00:42:43.821 --> 00:42:44.654
<v Speaker 2>professors who then get promoted and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tenure because they publish in journals </v>

868
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.600
<v Speaker 2>and their stuff is almost never cited by</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

869
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:51.853
<v Speaker 2>But yet that's how you rise up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens is you have a </v>

870
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:56.144
<v Speaker 2>whole Canon of knowledge and you go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and teach people and then you have </v>

871
00:43:00.561 --> 00:43:02.450
<v Speaker 2>diversity training and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

872
00:43:02.451 --> 00:43:06.320
<v Speaker 2>the shame of this whole thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is legitimacy to white power.</v>

873
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.170
<v Speaker 2>There is legitimacy to some of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

874
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.033
<v Speaker 2>but the way that it's metastasized </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost doesn't allow any kind of </v>

875
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.863
<v Speaker 2>liberation.</v>

876
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:22.040
<v Speaker 2>It does almost the exact opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they want to do because it gets you</v>

877
00:43:22.041 --> 00:43:23.980
<v Speaker 2>people like trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one more thing I would say.</v>

878
00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:24.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

879
00:43:24.541 --> 00:43:25.374
<v Speaker 2>but then what happens is it goes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges of education and then they </v>

880
00:43:28.491 --> 00:43:32.120
<v Speaker 2>start teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think I told you my son has in his</v>

881
00:43:32.121 --> 00:43:36.680
<v Speaker 2>geography has geography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civics.</v>

882
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at stuff he doesn't,</v>

883
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:41.480
<v Speaker 2>they've never even opened a map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never opened a map.</v>

884
00:43:41.481 --> 00:43:44.480
<v Speaker 2>They've never in civics class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many Supreme Court justices?</v>

885
00:43:44.481 --> 00:43:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Legislative branch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many said none of that stuff.</v>

886
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.740
<v Speaker 2>But he knows everything about the black </v>
<v Speaker 2>panthers.</v>

887
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 2>But he knows everything about the civil </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

888
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.910
<v Speaker 2>The civil rights movement is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

889
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it should not.</v>

890
00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.430
<v Speaker 2>We need to look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at him at,</v>

891
00:43:58.431 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 2>we need kids need to know what countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>above Canada.</v>

892
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:01.574
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this stuff gets back to certain </v>

893
00:44:03.231 --> 00:44:04.064
<v Speaker 2>departments in the university that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pumping out nonsense that are </v>

894
00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:09.590
<v Speaker 2>indoctrinating people and exactly like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

895
00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:12.230
<v Speaker 2>they have their own defensive structures</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

896
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.333
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being offended as the new thing I </v>

897
00:44:15.171 --> 00:44:18.050
<v Speaker 2>inclusion is another word that they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed the meaning of.</v>

898
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.980
<v Speaker 2>So there was a direct line between is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this company,</v>

899
00:44:21.981 --> 00:44:23.810
<v Speaker 2>is this clear so far?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you to me.</v>

900
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

901
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:26.720
<v Speaker 2>So there's a judge with the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

902
00:44:26.721 --> 00:44:28.930
<v Speaker 2>So cause if it's not clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something needs to be unpacked.</v>

903
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.773
<v Speaker 2>So they want to overthrow these </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional and they've manufactured </v>

904
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:36.240
<v Speaker 2>their own base of scholarship to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how would you,</v>

905
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.750
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's worse than crumbling </v>
<v Speaker 2>because at least if something crumbles,</v>

906
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 2>something worse didn't take its place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if in a lot like it's like a having</v>

907
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:44.874
<v Speaker 2>an alarm clock that rings randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's worse than just having an alarm </v>

908
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:49.200
<v Speaker 2>clock that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

909
00:44:49.201 --> 00:44:50.034
<v Speaker 2>they're pumping out fabricated nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally untethered to reality in </v>

910
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 2>the moment you call these people out on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

911
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.740
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe in dialogue in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they deal.</v>

912
00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.753
<v Speaker 2>They'll slander you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The write your name on the bathroom </v>

913
00:45:00.991 --> 00:45:02.190
<v Speaker 2>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll scream at you.</v>

914
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.220
<v Speaker 2>So the only thing to do is you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoax some you,</v>

915
00:45:04.221 --> 00:45:05.054
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to have a nontraditional way to </v>

916
00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:07.524
<v Speaker 2>deal with people who are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally irrational that they're </v>

917
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:16.190
<v Speaker 2>going to have a conversation and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>led you to writing this hoax and turning</v>

918
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:18.780
<v Speaker 2>this thing on its head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right there,</v>

919
00:45:18.781 --> 00:45:19.860
<v Speaker 2>there was so much there I want to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

920
00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the connection with the religious</v>

921
00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:24.990
<v Speaker 2>mind that people have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful,</v>

922
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.880
<v Speaker 2>this strikes me as the new religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics but,</v>

923
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 2>but this leftist postmodern marks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that this is the new religion.</v>

924
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.093
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they mon hundred bakemark everyone else </v>

925
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:37.734
<v Speaker 2>for their beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have a belief that is so </v>

926
00:45:40.441 --> 00:45:45.441
<v Speaker 2>tethered to their own being that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge it in any way they outcome,</v>

927
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:47.460
<v Speaker 2>well they'll hate you.</v>

928
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.580
<v Speaker 2>But they'll also outkast anyone 100% </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

929
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:54.270
<v Speaker 2>And so what do you say about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is an awesome question.</v>

930
00:45:54.271 --> 00:45:57.870
<v Speaker 2>So Lindsay and I wrote him on every now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wrote and wrote a paper again,</v>

931
00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:58.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>privileges the original sin for the </v>

932
00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:01.470
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

933
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.300
<v Speaker 2>but there is one fundamental difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

934
00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.213
<v Speaker 2>you're having schermer and prager come </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the studio and debate and it's </v>

935
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:11.520
<v Speaker 2>going to be civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to punch each other.</v>

936
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.580
<v Speaker 2>They have fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually very fundamental,</v>

937
00:46:14.581 --> 00:46:15.414
<v Speaker 2>just moral disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them prager blends that you </v>

938
00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:19.884
<v Speaker 2>cannot have morality without God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And shermer believes the complete </v>

939
00:46:22.741 --> 00:46:24.900
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is powerful stuff,</v>

940
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've agreed and they're going to have</v>

941
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:29.060
<v Speaker 2>a dialogue about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not going to score,</v>

942
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:30.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

943
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really,</v>

944
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of Beta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having a conversation is much better.</v>

945
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:38.700
<v Speaker 2>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have the same mechanisms in the,</v>

946
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.000
<v Speaker 2>in this new secular religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have privilege,</v>

947
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:46.560
<v Speaker 2>which is a type of original sin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have blasphemy laws,</v>

948
00:46:46.561 --> 00:46:49.830
<v Speaker 2>which are political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're really clear that.</v>

949
00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.910
<v Speaker 2>So would you say the privileges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the originals,</v>

950
00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 2>and that's like saying Jesus died for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your sins,</v>

951
00:46:54.121 --> 00:46:55.410
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>

952
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:59.210
<v Speaker 2>if you were born white and especially </v>
<v Speaker 2>CIS gendered heterosexual,</v>

953
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.200
<v Speaker 2>that Shit that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are the,</v>

954
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.080
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing you can ditch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

955
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.440
<v Speaker 2>To.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the part that except bow,</v>

956
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:08.303
<v Speaker 2>this is the part that's the mind blow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the part that makes me </v>

957
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:12.443
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably sympathetic to Christians </v>
<v Speaker 2>in particular as opposed to other </v>

958
00:47:15.991 --> 00:47:16.824
<v Speaker 2>religions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really changed my mind </v>

959
00:47:17.581 --> 00:47:20.970
<v Speaker 2>significantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians have a redemption narrative.</v>

960
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.670
<v Speaker 2>These people have no redemption </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>

961
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:25.350
<v Speaker 2>If you're a privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

962
00:47:25.351 --> 00:47:26.790
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

963
00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:28.440
<v Speaker 2>there is no redemption for you.</v>

964
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.710
<v Speaker 2>You can bow down for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

965
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:35.920
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about being able to be</v>

966
00:47:35.921 --> 00:47:36.754
<v Speaker 2>redeemed that these people don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why you see these vitriolic </v>

967
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 2>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're merciless on other people on the</v>

968
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:46.950
<v Speaker 2>left eating other people on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old,</v>

969
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.711
<v Speaker 2>the old bras,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

970
00:47:47.711 --> 00:47:49.210
<v Speaker 2>the snake that eats itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

971
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:50.943
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

972
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:52.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

973
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:54.310
<v Speaker 2>so it is a new secular religion and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

974
00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.650
<v Speaker 2>maybe we have modules in our brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

975
00:47:56.651 --> 00:47:58.920
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's covariant there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

976
00:47:58.921 --> 00:48:00.730
<v Speaker 2>There are things in the culture and act </v>
<v Speaker 2>in our brain.</v>

977
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 2>And we have the same thing we have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan hightest.</v>

978
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:06.490
<v Speaker 2>It talked about three of purity versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying to maybe we have,</v>

979
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways of interpreting reality,</v>

980
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.130
<v Speaker 2>but make no mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a secular religion.</v>

981
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:14.830
<v Speaker 2>And when you call out the emperor having</v>
<v Speaker 2>no clothes,</v>

982
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.260
<v Speaker 2>you dad is that you have committed,</v>

983
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:19.540
<v Speaker 1>you are in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

984
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.433
<v Speaker 1>Which I think has a bit to do have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recent hatchet jobs that have been </v>

985
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:24.424
<v Speaker 1>done on me and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sleep basically wrote a piece about </v>

986
00:48:26.351 --> 00:48:27.790
<v Speaker 1>you after this whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

987
00:48:27.791 --> 00:48:29.770
<v Speaker 1>And it really was kind of strong madding</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you did,</v>

988
00:48:29.771 --> 00:48:31.600
<v Speaker 1>but the attacks were also kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal.</v>

989
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:32.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's</v>

990
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:34.910
<v Speaker 2>always is an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

991
00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:38.970
<v Speaker 2>in salon goes after me or you asleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause after me or you or Sam,</v>

992
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.621
<v Speaker 2>whoever Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

993
00:48:39.621 --> 00:48:43.160
<v Speaker 2>wherever they go after there was a kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Pr Animus.</v>

994
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:47.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a kind of personal attack that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not just a,</v>

995
00:48:47.641 --> 00:48:49.140
<v Speaker 2>an engagement of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

996
00:48:49.141 --> 00:48:49.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did this,</v>

997
00:48:49.831 --> 00:48:50.880
<v Speaker 2>this is why it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

998
00:48:50.881 --> 00:48:52.070
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know it's not,</v>

999
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.070
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was funny,</v>

1000
00:48:53.071 --> 00:48:55.260
<v Speaker 2>but you're wrong about this and here's </v>
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>

1001
00:48:55.261 --> 00:48:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply personal attack on someone.</v>

1002
00:48:59.221 --> 00:49:00.054
<v Speaker 2>So I called them on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I emailed them at least one toy </v>

1003
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:03.990
<v Speaker 2>few times and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1004
00:49:03.991 --> 00:49:04.824
<v Speaker 2>you guys wrote this about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like an opportunity to respond </v>

1005
00:49:08.311 --> 00:49:10.110
<v Speaker 2>to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1006
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Then I went on twitter and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1007
00:49:11.671 --> 00:49:13.150
<v Speaker 2>can I please have an opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1008
00:49:13.151 --> 00:49:13.984
<v Speaker 2>well you know he won't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact wording was but </v>

1009
00:49:15.901 --> 00:49:18.270
<v Speaker 2>can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like an opportunity.</v>

1010
00:49:18.271 --> 00:49:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like an arbitrary,</v>

1011
00:49:21.001 --> 00:49:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's a new thing in journalism.</v>

1012
00:49:22.561 --> 00:49:23.394
<v Speaker 2>Like you just write hit pieces on </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone and then you don't give him an </v>

1013
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.270
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

1014
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I think Hayes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>

1015
00:49:27.061 --> 00:49:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I think what's starting to happen is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because journal isn't,</v>

1016
00:49:29.821 --> 00:49:31.890
<v Speaker 1>because mainstream journalism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumbling.</v>

1017
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still use that,</v>

1018
00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.400
<v Speaker 1>that adjective there and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody cares about CNN anymore.</v>

1019
00:49:37.401 --> 00:49:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even the New York Times I think has,</v>

1020
00:49:39.181 --> 00:49:40.014
<v Speaker 1>has gone in a really terrible direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they love a lot of the ideas that </v>

1021
00:49:42.961 --> 00:49:43.794
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But since the institutions are </v>

1022
00:49:45.031 --> 00:49:45.864
<v Speaker 1>crumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now everybody just picks their </v>

1023
00:49:46.921 --> 00:49:47.754
<v Speaker 1>website that they can try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those websites are funded by all sorts </v>

1024
00:49:49.861 --> 00:49:50.694
<v Speaker 1>of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you've got an editor who has </v>

1025
00:49:52.081 --> 00:49:55.170
<v Speaker 1>bought in to your postmodern bullshit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this case,</v>

1026
00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.213
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say whatever the hell you want </v>

1027
00:49:57.181 --> 00:49:57.931
<v Speaker 1>about Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

1028
00:49:57.931 --> 00:49:59.760
<v Speaker 1>or whoever else and you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>backing.</v>

1029
00:49:59.761 --> 00:50:00.594
<v Speaker 1>So for this whole craziness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened with me and mother Jones says </v>

1030
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:05.370
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth has been removed from that.</v>

1031
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1032
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Which has been removed from that and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them for this editor.</v>

1033
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.790
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the title of the thing was about the,</v>

1034
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:15.570
<v Speaker 1>the new extremist further to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to talk about that.</v>

1035
00:50:15.571 --> 00:50:18.640
<v Speaker 1>So we have to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be out of your mind or,</v>

1036
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:19.683
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just a lie are of the highest order </v>

1037
00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:22.530
<v Speaker 1>to think that of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1038
00:50:22.531 --> 00:50:24.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can criticize me for all you want.</v>

1039
00:50:24.571 --> 00:50:25.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I address criticism.</v>

1040
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I hear if people think I don't ask the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1041
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that he's a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist.</v>

1042
00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 1>He has a religious mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1043
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:35.570
<v Speaker 1>this is a religion to these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

1044
00:50:35.571 --> 00:50:38.420
<v Speaker 1>so that's the interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I went on the full on,</v>

1045
00:50:38.421 --> 00:50:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1046
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:40.940
<v Speaker 1>You picked the wrong person to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1047
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went on the absolute attack.</v>

1048
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.433
<v Speaker 1>I was defended publicly by you Brogan </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a whole slew of other people to the </v>

1049
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:52.490
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of retweets and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

1050
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:57.410
<v Speaker 1>And then V to I guess two days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was writing about how noah,</v>

1051
00:50:57.411 --> 00:50:59.570
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't believe I'm an extremist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't,</v>

1052
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:01.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no public correction.</v>

1053
00:51:01.761 --> 00:51:02.594
<v Speaker 1>They do slight things at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>article that no one's gonna ever see </v>

1054
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:07.460
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia that is still run with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real thing.</v>

1055
00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.393
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goes,</v>

1056
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I tagged the editor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman,</v>

1057
00:51:10.221 --> 00:51:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Clara Jeffery and all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all the tweets,</v>

1058
00:51:12.621 --> 00:51:13.454
<v Speaker 1>she never responds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's never gotten this much twitter </v>

1059
00:51:14.781 --> 00:51:15.614
<v Speaker 1>attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't feel a need to because </v>

1060
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 1>they know that their monster is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to keep moving forward.</v>

1061
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I'm trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antidote.</v>

1062
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:24.164
<v Speaker 1>So just to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and so what did he say about your </v>

1063
00:51:27.561 --> 00:51:30.570
<v Speaker 1>show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The title and you can look at it.</v>

1064
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:31.423
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it still is pinned tweet right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>though I suspect he's either deleted it </v>

1065
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:34.463
<v Speaker 1>or removed it all together was something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the rise of the new extremism or </v>

1066
00:51:39.171 --> 00:51:42.620
<v Speaker 1>the newest extremists that are further </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the right than Breitbart.</v>

1067
00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Then he includes me in that where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>refers to me as far right,</v>

1068
00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:46.853
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then eventually change that to just </v>

1069
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:51.710
<v Speaker 1>write which the right left thing doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even make any sense anymore.</v>

1070
00:51:51.711 --> 00:51:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I can put all that aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned at the top,</v>

1071
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Forbes called this a conservative show </v>
<v Speaker 1>last week.</v>

1072
00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:57.853
<v Speaker 1>I've said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you were the first one I ever </v>

1073
00:51:58.791 --> 00:51:59.624
<v Speaker 1>said it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that defending my liberal principles is </v>

1074
00:52:01.221 --> 00:52:02.054
<v Speaker 1>becoming a conservative position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of these labels are starting to </v>

1075
00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:05.954
<v Speaker 1>make no sense and that's just part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the what's happened here and that sort </v>

1076
00:52:08.761 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of things here.</v>

1077
00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:10.903
<v Speaker 1>If you had an itemized checklist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could just write your beliefs </v>

1078
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:14.264
<v Speaker 1>down and you check you and I would both </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly fall into the liberal </v>

1079
00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:19.520
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the left camp.</v>

1080
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.373
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I've been saying liberal </v>

1081
00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:23.610
<v Speaker 1>is not left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad is a crane.</v>

1082
00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:26.000
<v Speaker 1>It's from state complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just to be clear for you,</v>

1083
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.060
<v Speaker 1>so without naming the person who wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>the article,</v>

1084
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:30.190
<v Speaker 1>the guy who wrote the article that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>

1085
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh Harkinson.</v>

1086
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Josh invited on your show?</v>

1087
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I invited him immediately.</v>

1088
00:52:36.201 --> 00:52:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I said No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he still invited on your show?</v>

1089
00:52:38.541 --> 00:52:41.930
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote something started like </v>
<v Speaker 1>first I said,</v>

1090
00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:43.183
<v Speaker 1>come on my show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you the first 10 minutes </v>

1091
00:52:44.421 --> 00:52:46.220
<v Speaker 1>without talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't respond to that.</v>

1092
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Then today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally days later I respond to it again</v>

1093
00:52:49.641 --> 00:52:51.920
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the day we're taping,</v>

1094
00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:54.350
<v Speaker 1>this is off of when we're airing it.</v>

1095
00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.330
<v Speaker 1>But today I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1096
00:52:56.331 --> 00:52:58.640
<v Speaker 1>will you come on the show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Hack.</v>

1097
00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:01.140
<v Speaker 1>So then I was being a little more heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>handed and you're old.</v>

1098
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I won't come on cause you called me a </v>
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

1099
00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many wouldn't come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hack thing was just an excuse,</v>

1100
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:07.663
<v Speaker 1>just to be completely clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said I was going to sit here for 10 </v>

1101
00:53:09.981 --> 00:53:11.240
<v Speaker 1>minutes or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd come on,</v>

1102
00:53:11.241 --> 00:53:12.074
<v Speaker 1>you can sit here and 10 minutes I will </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit here and I wasn't anything outside </v>

1103
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:15.710
<v Speaker 1>of the editor too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1104
00:53:15.711 --> 00:53:17.540
<v Speaker 1>She's welcome to come on and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1105
00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:19.520
<v Speaker 1>but in an odd way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that,</v>

1106
00:53:19.521 --> 00:53:21.100
<v Speaker 1>and someone pointed this out to me on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

1107
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.290
<v Speaker 1>one of the strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>odd,</v>

1108
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.890
<v Speaker 1>same voices said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

1109
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.640
<v Speaker 1>that was to be the worst thing you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1110
00:53:26.641 --> 00:53:27.474
<v Speaker 1>Because what you're doing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging more people to do things </v>

1111
00:53:30.001 --> 00:53:32.400
<v Speaker 1>like urging people to say crazy things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>

1112
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 1>You then get in a huff puff and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta defend yourself and now what's the</v>

1113
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:36.930
<v Speaker 1>next thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you got to,</v>

1114
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you got to sit and take it on your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

1115
00:53:39.061 --> 00:53:42.810
<v Speaker 1>which is so completely against the ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you care about.</v>

1116
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want my life to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1117
00:53:45.031 --> 00:53:46.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's why my left to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

1118
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

1119
00:53:47.961 --> 00:53:49.740
<v Speaker 1>it's an odd punish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1120
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:51.840
<v Speaker 1>And yet you don't want to just ignore </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1121
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:56.120
<v Speaker 1>It's against human nature to be attacked</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to just sit down and take.</v>

1122
00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:59.940
<v Speaker 1>That's why we talked before about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to figure out whose voices matter.</v>

1123
00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1124
00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:04.800
<v Speaker 1>and I mean I don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

1125
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:09.400
<v Speaker 1>but does his voice mattered to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean is this guy's opinion no hit,</v>

1126
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:10.303
<v Speaker 1>he's utterly irrelevant to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he wrote a piece in a publication </v>

1127
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:16.560
<v Speaker 1>that has saw so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the publication has some relevance.</v>

1128
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.640
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

1129
00:54:17.641 --> 00:54:18.474
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned at the top also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was one of 40 people that the </v>

1130
00:54:21.121 --> 00:54:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Virginia Gop Baseball Games shooter </v>
<v Speaker 1>followed.</v>

1131
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.133
<v Speaker 1>So we know that that guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was riled up by a lot of the political </v>

1132
00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:29.874
<v Speaker 1>stuff he was reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you could just look at his </v>

1133
00:54:30.511 --> 00:54:33.570
<v Speaker 1>facebook and all that to see that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much he hated Republicans,</v>

1134
00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:34.404
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're calling me an extremist </v>

1135
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:37.733
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cost now that ideas and </v>

1136
00:54:39.931 --> 00:54:40.764
<v Speaker 1>intentions matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I think you can attack the </v>

1137
00:54:42.961 --> 00:54:45.000
<v Speaker 1>hell out of ideas and you and you not </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

1138
00:54:45.001 --> 00:54:46.800
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a need.</v>

1139
00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:50.670
<v Speaker 1>You should be instigating violence and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there in lies the rub.</v>

1140
00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:56.510
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel now about all this now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's been a day behind you and him?</v>

1141
00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:57.383
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel angry when it happened on </v>

1142
00:54:58.921 --> 00:54:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Friday?</v>

1143
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was livid.</v>

1144
00:55:00.151 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York City and I was walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of Time Square.</v>

1145
00:55:02.581 --> 00:55:04.440
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in Times Square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the craziest place on earth.</v>

1146
00:55:04.441 --> 00:55:05.101
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1147
00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:05.934
<v Speaker 1>stimulation via bananas and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just flicking off twitter and </v>

1148
00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling people and like I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy them and everything else.</v>

1149
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.560
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:14.394
<v Speaker 1>some people said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the very definition of libel </v>

1151
00:55:16.381 --> 00:55:17.214
<v Speaker 1>because it's the mantras really untrue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's attacking your income source </v>

1152
00:55:19.681 --> 00:55:21.840
<v Speaker 1>because of the reference to Patriot on </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these other things.</v>

1153
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sue the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1154
00:55:23.221 --> 00:55:23.970
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1155
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:24.803
<v Speaker 1>I've been on the record as saying I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>for libel and I'm a free speech </v>

1156
00:55:26.581 --> 00:55:27.414
<v Speaker 1>absolutist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are laws that we have related </v>

1157
00:55:29.341 --> 00:55:31.050
<v Speaker 1>to liable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a secondary thing.</v>

1158
00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:32.213
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then on,</v>

1159
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.040
<v Speaker 1>on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1160
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:36.083
<v Speaker 1>when it calmed down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got home from New York on Sunday </v>

1161
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.691
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this cause you're,</v>

1162
00:55:39.691 --> 00:55:40.770
<v Speaker 1>you're in my house right now.</v>

1163
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I came home and my dog was staggering </v>
<v Speaker 1>around Emma.</v>

1164
00:55:44.161 --> 00:55:45.960
<v Speaker 1>She's 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

1165
00:55:45.961 --> 00:55:46.794
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love this dog with every fiber of my </v>

1166
00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She uh,</v>

1167
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:50.543
<v Speaker 1>she was a rescue from Hurricane Katrina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had her for 11 years and she was </v>

1168
00:55:54.331 --> 00:55:57.660
<v Speaker 1>staggering and she was having trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing and she looked confused and her</v>

1169
00:55:57.661 --> 00:56:01.410
<v Speaker 1>eyes are darting around and then I spent</v>
<v Speaker 1>the night and we had to bring her as she</v>

1170
00:56:01.411 --> 00:56:03.300
<v Speaker 1>stayed at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the animal hospital over night.</v>

1171
00:56:03.301 --> 00:56:04.134
<v Speaker 1>We just got her back today and she has </v>
<v Speaker 1>some issues that we're hopefully going </v>

1172
00:56:06.691 --> 00:56:07.524
<v Speaker 1>can work on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it completely put everything in </v>

1173
00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:11.640
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That animal is more important to me than</v>

1174
00:56:11.641 --> 00:56:12.940
<v Speaker 1>this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1175
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:13.853
<v Speaker 1>Without question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean I'm not going to get </v>

1176
00:56:15.061 --> 00:56:17.430
<v Speaker 1>riled up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my love of this animal farts,</v>

1177
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.910
<v Speaker 1>what we talked about before about </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships in,</v>

1178
00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.940
<v Speaker 1>and you have really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two too,</v>

1179
00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.153
<v Speaker 2>create a crazy dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those relationships matter and in </v>

1180
00:56:29.411 --> 00:56:33.710
<v Speaker 2>that sense they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they not superseded,</v>

1181
00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.553
<v Speaker 2>not override,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it made you refocus on what </v>

1182
00:56:35.891 --> 00:56:36.724
<v Speaker 2>mattered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could be doing all this stuff </v>

1183
00:56:37.931 --> 00:56:40.510
<v Speaker 2>like that thing and private Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that scene where the guy's like saying,</v>

1184
00:56:40.511 --> 00:56:41.344
<v Speaker 2>are we going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We this and he gets a bullet in the </v>

1185
00:56:42.011 --> 00:56:42.850
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1186
00:56:42.851 --> 00:56:45.280
<v Speaker 2>like now you have a sick animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1187
00:56:45.281 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 2>like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your dog is sick and you love your dog.</v>

1188
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.900
<v Speaker 2>And I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's interesting.</v>

1189
00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:50.734
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether or not having him </v>
<v Speaker 2>on would be your mistake or not because </v>

1190
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:57.710
<v Speaker 2>it would encourage other people to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

1191
00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:58.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I know it would because it's a </v>

1192
00:56:59.341 --> 00:57:01.320
<v Speaker 1>feeding frenzy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how these guys operate.</v>

1193
00:57:01.321 --> 00:57:03.720
<v Speaker 1>We've seen this before with many things </v>
<v Speaker 1>in college.</v>

1194
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think his motivation was?</v>

1195
00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't,</v>

1196
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:12.210
<v Speaker 1>what is the motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I believe that it's exactly what</v>

1197
00:57:12.211 --> 00:57:14.970
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's this religious,</v>

1198
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were it,</v>

1199
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:18.900
<v Speaker 1>what was the word you use there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was this religious,</v>

1200
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:23.580
<v Speaker 1>quasi religious or moral motivated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A secular religion.</v>

1201
00:57:23.581 --> 00:57:24.211
<v Speaker 1>Security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1202
00:57:24.211 --> 00:57:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1203
00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:27.150
<v Speaker 1>It's this secular religion that they so </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>

1204
00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:31.230
<v Speaker 1>So I veered off the path for these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that I'm gay,</v>

1205
00:57:31.231 --> 00:57:33.030
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter that I'm pro pot.</v>

1206
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:34.103
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that I'm pro choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that I'm for </v>

1207
00:57:36.091 --> 00:57:36.924
<v Speaker 1>euthanasia to check us all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one side is religious and this is </v>

1208
00:57:42.061 --> 00:57:44.700
<v Speaker 1>why I talk about the left more because </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the right,</v>

1209
00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:47.130
<v Speaker 1>even though they know all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1210
00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I still get invited places.</v>

1211
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:49.973
<v Speaker 1>I get put on prager u videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get invited to college kids that want </v>

1212
00:57:52.651 --> 00:57:54.780
<v Speaker 1>to talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put aside all the different,</v>

1213
00:57:54.781 --> 00:57:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I was at a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1214
00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:58.320
<v Speaker 1>students for liberty thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1215
00:57:58.321 --> 00:58:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm for single payer healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians don't like that.</v>

1216
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.820
<v Speaker 1>They booed me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then laughed.</v>

1217
00:58:02.821 --> 00:58:05.440
<v Speaker 1>We laughed about it and I kind of mock </v>
<v Speaker 1>them for boomi.</v>

1218
00:58:05.441 --> 00:58:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Guys were the tolerant ones on guys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got it.</v>

1219
00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:09.713
<v Speaker 1>I don't get any invites the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I think that phrase is so </v>

1220
00:58:13.081 --> 00:58:15.090
<v Speaker 1>perfect because this is the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

1221
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:15.953
<v Speaker 1>It is the new religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think you don't get msnbc </v>

1222
00:58:18.751 --> 00:58:20.130
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have you on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1223
00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't beg him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on Fox last week.</v>

1224
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Greg Gutfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a great guy.</v>

1225
00:58:24.061 --> 00:58:26.250
<v Speaker 1>He was going to come on in here really </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing good stuff.</v>

1226
00:58:26.251 --> 00:58:27.660
<v Speaker 1>We disagree on some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1227
00:58:27.661 --> 00:58:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Big Dam up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't beg them.</v>

1228
00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Why does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does Fox put on Ion and MSNBC?</v>

1229
00:58:34.111 --> 00:58:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Does he see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1230
00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:35.993
<v Speaker 1>they've got such a wonderful question </v>
<v Speaker 1>that demand that we should demand </v>

1231
00:58:38.821 --> 00:58:39.654
<v Speaker 1>answers to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see last week that the hearings </v>

1232
00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.500
<v Speaker 1>last week a hawk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

1233
00:58:43.501 --> 00:58:45.190
<v Speaker 1>The actor that plays Hulk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1234
00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:47.460
<v Speaker 1>the actor that Plays Hall Company helped</v>
<v Speaker 1>me here.</v>

1235
00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Mark refollow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1236
00:58:51.601 --> 00:58:52.381
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about,</v>

1237
00:58:52.381 --> 00:58:53.214
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>MSNBC is hiring these white </v>

1238
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:55.103
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting because he's </v>

1239
00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:00.350
<v Speaker 1>judging people's political opinions on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their skin color number one.</v>

1240
00:59:00.351 --> 00:59:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Now he's a white guy who plays a green </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy so that there's something occurring.</v>

1241
00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:04.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must,</v>

1242
00:59:04.141 --> 00:59:06.690
<v Speaker 1>as a philosophy professor mustard up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be some deep shit there.</v>

1243
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:07.733
<v Speaker 1>But even putting that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they started hiring a bunch of black </v>

1244
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.823
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't be happy about that either </v>

1245
00:59:12.061 --> 00:59:15.030
<v Speaker 1>because he would accuse them of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncle toms or something.</v>

1246
00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:17.850
<v Speaker 1>We can party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Clarence Thomas,</v>

1247
00:59:17.851 --> 00:59:18.684
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need more Supreme Court justices </v>

1248
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 1>there a bike too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like would you rather have more</v>

1249
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:24.283
<v Speaker 2>Clarence Thomas is on the Supreme Court </v>
<v Speaker 2>or would you rather have more white </v>

1250
00:59:26.571 --> 00:59:27.404
<v Speaker 2>liberals on the Supreme Court?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think is the antidote to </v>

1251
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:29.864
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've been trying to push the </v>

1252
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:33.830
<v Speaker 2>ideas of classical liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>

1253
00:59:33.831 --> 00:59:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the individual is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only antidote to this.</v>

1254
00:59:37.491 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 2>If you relentlessly stand for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

1255
00:59:40.101 --> 00:59:42.290
<v Speaker 2>you will always stand for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

1256
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.333
<v Speaker 2>You will always be tolerant of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences because you will realize </v>

1257
00:59:45.831 --> 00:59:46.664
<v Speaker 2>that your different than the next guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't look at somebody and prejudge </v>

1258
00:59:50.061 --> 00:59:50.894
<v Speaker 2>them based on color or say I have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>treat them like are some animal because </v>

1259
00:59:54.681 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 2>they have this level of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppression where the other that,</v>

1260
00:59:58.821 --> 00:59:59.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you put,</v>

1261
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.613
<v Speaker 2>you put your finger on the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about the opposite </v>

1262
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.430
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intersectionality is the problem.</v>

1263
01:00:04.431 --> 01:00:09.320
<v Speaker 2>We haven't talked about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that there is grievance jockeying.</v>

1264
01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Gad said the oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics,</v>

1265
01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:11.763
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1266
01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:12.643
<v Speaker 2>We we need the opposite of Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>intersectionality and we need union </v>

1267
01:00:17.201 --> 01:00:18.034
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and there's a line of </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature called a superordinate </v>

1268
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:24.560
<v Speaker 2>identities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's unpack that real quick.</v>

1269
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the Heineken commercial?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1270
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.080
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1271
01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:30.943
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's everything that I've tried to do </v>

1272
01:00:31.611 --> 01:00:32.320
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1273
01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.150
<v Speaker 2>so that's what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need,</v>

1274
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:37.850
<v Speaker 2>can you just lay it out real quick for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

1275
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:38.703
<v Speaker 2>We'll lay out the heineken cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just basically get people together </v>

1276
01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:41.474
<v Speaker 2>who you'd think have nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other or should we write political </v>

1277
01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:44.954
<v Speaker 2>enemies or personal enemies and they sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>down over a drink and do it and they do </v>

1278
01:00:48.321 --> 01:00:50.020
<v Speaker 2>it well then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1279
01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:51.100
<v Speaker 2>they're not sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1280
01:00:51.101 --> 01:00:52.700
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do some task,</v>

1281
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:53.534
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some hard task and then at the </v>

1282
01:00:54.861 --> 01:00:56.210
<v Speaker 2>end they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to have a beer?</v>

1283
01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:00.530
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they talk as an example of a,</v>

1284
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:02.503
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a union ality as opposed to </v>

1285
01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:05.240
<v Speaker 2>intersectionality.</v>

1286
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.960
<v Speaker 2>We're not grieving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not trying to find out who has the</v>

1287
01:01:08.961 --> 01:01:09.794
<v Speaker 2>most strikes against them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the most depressed and then they </v>

1288
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:14.540
<v Speaker 2>get the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1289
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:16.850
<v Speaker 2>they get the rights to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The blm,</v>

1290
01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1291
01:01:18.471 --> 01:01:19.304
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over over can talk to the pride Martin </v>

1292
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:24.110
<v Speaker 2>March or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we need to do is,</v>

1293
01:01:24.111 --> 01:01:24.944
<v Speaker 2>or the shooting in Virginia right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to appeal to larger identities </v>

1294
01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:30.643
<v Speaker 2>and we need to coalition build and I see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left over and over again continuing </v>

1295
01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:39.530
<v Speaker 2>to dig down in identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>continuing to,</v>

1296
01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:41.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use intersectionality to find the most </v>

1297
01:01:42.771 --> 01:01:43.604
<v Speaker 2>marginalized and oppressed groups and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then to attempt to change either the </v>

1298
01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:47.684
<v Speaker 2>nature of words either or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the structure of the rule sets and </v>

1299
01:01:51.371 --> 01:01:54.170
<v Speaker 2>our institutions to privilege these </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

1300
01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 2>John Rawls had this whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt,</v>

1301
01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:56.924
<v Speaker 2>but I think superordinate identities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding identities and things that we </v>

1302
01:02:00.381 --> 01:02:02.750
<v Speaker 2>have in common and working to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>coalitions and I,</v>

1303
01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:05.960
<v Speaker 2>and I think if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the left continues to do that,</v>

1304
01:02:05.961 --> 01:02:09.830
<v Speaker 2>we'll either get another four years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump or that other lunatic pants.</v>

1305
01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:10.850
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1306
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:12.670
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to build identities.</v>

1307
01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:15.280
<v Speaker 2>It's funny that you describe it that way</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>

1308
01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.480
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about cultural,</v>

1309
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>

1310
01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:20.290
<v Speaker 2>And yet so people will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well Pete,</v>

1311
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Pete must be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be on the right.</v>

1312
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:23.950
<v Speaker 2>It must be some sort of evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative or whatever.</v>

1313
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.010
<v Speaker 2>And yet you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1314
01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.930
<v Speaker 2>and I do more I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1315
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:29.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to use conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said this chapter,</v>

1316
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to use it as a pejorative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1317
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 2>so that's the thing I don't feel at </v>
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

1318
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:34.524
<v Speaker 2>I no longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it's cause I'm oddly situated </v>

1319
01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:37.860
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another word they love.</v>

1320
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:40.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm oddly situated in the academy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland new,</v>

1321
01:02:40.561 --> 01:02:45.561
<v Speaker 2>which is very left to center anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though the overwhelming majority of</v>

1322
01:02:46.051 --> 01:02:50.490
<v Speaker 2>my beliefs I would call self identify as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a classical liberal.</v>

1323
01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:52.163
<v Speaker 2>I no longer feel at home with anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with things that are even broadly </v>

1324
01:02:57.331 --> 01:02:59.370
<v Speaker 2>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you and other people have called for</v>

1325
01:02:59.371 --> 01:03:01.710
<v Speaker 2>the new center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that might be what we need.</v>

1326
01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:03.510
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't feel at home in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1327
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.373
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of that checklist of beliefs </v>

1328
01:03:05.611 --> 01:03:06.444
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I feel that I'm efficient cause I </v>

1329
01:03:08.861 --> 01:03:12.330
<v Speaker 2>kind of feel like when I lived in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Albuquerque I feel that I'm wandering,</v>

1330
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:13.860
<v Speaker 2>not wondering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that I've,</v>

1331
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a home and I don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable anywhere,</v>

1332
01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:18.564
<v Speaker 2>but one of the consequences of not </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling comfortable is when you meet </v>

1333
01:03:21.091 --> 01:03:26.091
<v Speaker 2>people who share those beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a kind of ideological kinship.</v>

1334
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:30.030
<v Speaker 2>You have a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1335
01:03:30.031 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 2>we're really on the out chair right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1336
01:03:32.011 --> 01:03:33.930
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're really trying to figure this out.</v>

1337
01:03:33.931 --> 01:03:38.160
<v Speaker 2>We're really trying to make some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to live a good life.</v>

1338
01:03:38.161 --> 01:03:38.994
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to be decent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were trying to make decisions on </v>

1339
01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:42.990
<v Speaker 2>the base of evidence and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we changed our minds and,</v>

1340
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.070
<v Speaker 2>but we're not at home and the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not at home on the left were being</v>

1341
01:03:47.071 --> 01:03:49.680
<v Speaker 2>excoriated on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the left for calling out,</v>

1342
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.440
<v Speaker 2>never make calling out somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>

1343
01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:54.720
<v Speaker 2>a right wing thing.</v>

1344
01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.170
<v Speaker 1>The moment you've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1345
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:58.100
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1346
01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:00.350
<v Speaker 1>you've become a farce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a caricature of yourself.</v>

1347
01:04:00.351 --> 01:04:01.101
<v Speaker 1>It's a farce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1348
01:04:01.101 --> 01:04:01.934
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting you've hit on so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many things because I love what we're </v>

1349
01:04:03.711 --> 01:04:04.544
<v Speaker 1>doing here because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the sort of these </v>

1350
01:04:05.511 --> 01:04:06.344
<v Speaker 1>broad issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also how they are directly </v>

1351
01:04:07.551 --> 01:04:11.120
<v Speaker 1>related to us as people and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think really matters.</v>

1352
01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>And even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1353
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:15.140
<v Speaker 1>just a week ago or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was in Philadelphia,</v>

1354
01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:18.110
<v Speaker 1>they unveiled their new gay pride </v>
<v Speaker 1>rainbow flag,</v>

1355
01:04:18.111 --> 01:04:21.750
<v Speaker 1>but now it has a black and brown color </v>
<v Speaker 1>bar,</v>

1356
01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:24.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to new color bars to represent people of</v>

1357
01:04:24.381 --> 01:04:27.380
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the height of absurdity.</v>

1358
01:04:27.381 --> 01:04:29.990
<v Speaker 1>The rainbow flag represented all gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1359
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>White Gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian Gay people,</v>

1360
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Muslim gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jewish gay people,</v>

1361
01:04:34.311 --> 01:04:35.144
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

1362
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:39.080
<v Speaker 1>There was no racial connotation to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the gay community,</v>

1363
01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.960
<v Speaker 1>at least from what I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is pretty good on,</v>

1364
01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:42.843
<v Speaker 1>on most race issues you see more couples</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that are racially different or </v>

1365
01:04:46.641 --> 01:04:47.474
<v Speaker 1>diverse or all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now because they had to bow to </v>

1366
01:04:50.691 --> 01:04:51.524
<v Speaker 1>whatever that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was directly related </v>

1367
01:04:52.491 --> 01:04:55.040
<v Speaker 1>to black lives matter or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they had to bow to them,</v>

1368
01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:55.874
<v Speaker 1>they've literally ruined the rainbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rainbow is we know what the rainbow </v>

1369
01:04:59.421 --> 01:05:00.254
<v Speaker 1>is now they're telling us the rainbow is</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently part of the patriarchy or </v>

1370
01:05:02.931 --> 01:05:03.560
<v Speaker 1>you're a racist.</v>

1371
01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.560
<v Speaker 2>There anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't end up but,</v>

1372
01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:06.690
<v Speaker 2>but here's the personal part.</v>

1373
01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.053
<v Speaker 1>So I thought all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I don't think I'm blowing </v>

1374
01:05:09.111 --> 01:05:11.060
<v Speaker 1>anyone's mind when I say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They understand what I think.</v>

1375
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:12.223
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't even want to tweet about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I didn't even feel like getting </v>

1376
01:05:14.361 --> 01:05:15.194
<v Speaker 1>involved on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I got to pick my battles and </v>

1377
01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>if I was gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1378
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.843
<v Speaker 1>someone's using you're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want a black bar and a brown </v>

1379
01:05:21.821 --> 01:05:22.654
<v Speaker 1>bar on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point would be there was no </v>

1380
01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:25.294
<v Speaker 1>racial kind of tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're now making it racist and guess </v>

1381
01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:28.444
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's years from now he's going to </v>

1382
01:05:29.951 --> 01:05:30.784
<v Speaker 1>have some other thing that they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put on there and they're going to have </v>

1383
01:05:31.981 --> 01:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>to make sure they're more oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>

1384
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And this is the endless snake eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1385
01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Something just within that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1386
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:41.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking about emily being sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things that </v>

1387
01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>people don't see when they attack you.</v>

1388
01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't like.</v>

1389
01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>You're just a guy living in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a dog,</v>

1390
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>you've got a husband you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make through the day,</v>

1391
01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:55.234
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think people need to take a step </v>

1392
01:05:57.851 --> 01:06:02.851
<v Speaker 1>back and realize that we're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Dave Rubin is a guy and he's</v>

1393
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 1>a good guy and he likes Heineken or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1394
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Ford Guy.</v>

1395
01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:10.090
<v Speaker 1>More footwear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're flawed people.</v>

1396
01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.670
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

1397
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 1>it's much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not necessarily the tone of the</v>

1398
01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:19.320
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1399
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1400
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel weird saying,</v>

1401
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:22.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to start doing attack,</v>

1402
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1403
01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:25.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not saying don't attack me.</v>

1404
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I want to do whatever they want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

1405
01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.533
<v Speaker 1>But I think that you would get more </v>
<v Speaker 1>mileage and more attention if those </v>

1406
01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:35.770
<v Speaker 1>criticisms were devoid of personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>

1407
01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reuben said this,</v>

1408
01:06:38.021 --> 01:06:40.150
<v Speaker 1>this is why I think it's wrong and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>lay it out.</v>

1409
01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I said before when people </v>

1410
01:06:41.741 --> 01:06:42.650
<v Speaker 1>would attack me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1411
01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't ask this question.</v>

1412
01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Are you asked the question the wrong way</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you you,</v>

1413
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.420
<v Speaker 1>you know my policy on interviewing as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to give rope to let people,</v>

1414
01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:50.423
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just asked you a lot of really broad </v>

1415
01:06:51.671 --> 01:06:52.504
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't know where you were </v>

1416
01:06:53.291 --> 01:06:54.760
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have hung yourself.</v>

1417
01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I in this instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you did,</v>

1418
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>but I've had guests that I think do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those I,</v>

1419
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>those are criticisms I'm more than happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to address and I,</v>

1420
01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I hope that five years from now I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of a better interviewer that I look</v>

1421
01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:08.620
<v Speaker 1>back on this and think this is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be better.</v>

1422
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I want to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're,</v>

1423
01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.120
<v Speaker 1>if you're going a jumping off point is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a right wing extremist,</v>

1424
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:15.160
<v Speaker 1>well then we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to really do this,</v>

1425
01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:18.310
<v Speaker 1>but I think what we've done here for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour is pretty good.</v>

1426
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.770
<v Speaker 1>We're going to wrap this thing cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1427
01:07:19.771 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 1>we're going to dinner with some friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we don't,</v>

1428
01:07:21.431 --> 01:07:23.500
<v Speaker 1>we didn't make up this friendship thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>were no,</v>

1429
01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:24.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1430
01:07:24.421 --> 01:07:27.510
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't an artifact of a say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:30.300
<v Speaker 1>You want to get drunk or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably yeah,</v>

1432
01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.110
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only supposed cause my diamond a low</v>

1433
01:07:32.111 --> 01:07:32.944
<v Speaker 1>sugar diet is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm only supposed to drink Pinot </v>

1434
01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:39.490
<v Speaker 1>grigio now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've been drinking a ton of that.</v>

1435
01:07:39.491 --> 01:07:40.270
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1436
01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that's our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the red,</v>

1437
01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:47.101
<v Speaker 1>but it was a pleasure as always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have to do these more than once a</v>

1438
01:07:47.621 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 1>year because I think it's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good catch up and it's a good,</v>

1439
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:51.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem.</v>

1440
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.070
<v Speaker 1>You grading whether I've moved forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>or or,</v>

1441
01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.370
<v Speaker 1>or breast or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be a fun thing.</v>

1442
01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1443
01:07:57.850 --> 01:08:01.510
<v Speaker 1>and who knows where our ideas are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>

1444
01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:02.344
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how our beliefs will change </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're confronted button new </v>

1445
01:08:04.611 --> 01:08:06.010
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's what we do know.</v>

1446
01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:07.323
<v Speaker 1>If either one of us thinks that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone off the rails or that we've made a </v>

1447
01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:10.684
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to call it out to the other </v>

1448
01:08:11.591 --> 01:08:14.410
<v Speaker 1>one and we're going to do so in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of a friendship.</v>

1449
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Well said for more on Peter Boghossian </v>
