<v Speaker 1>Jenny Wilson.</v>

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's great to be here.</v>

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>I am glad to have you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading your bio and it said that </v>

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.781
<v Speaker 1>you were a fifth generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utah u t a h n.</v>

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was spelled that way.</v>

8
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sure it was even pronounced </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>but I did it right.</v>

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 2>You did write down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't throw the Aan.</v>

11
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.140
<v Speaker 2>What would that even though you're not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utah?</v>

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why I thought</v>

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Utah or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you are a fifth generation use.</v>

14
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I said to you right before we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually never been to Utah,</v>

15
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>so I only know the things of Utah that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of get out there</v>

16
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 2>like John Stockton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Karl Malone,</v>

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 2>the jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aren't doing well right now,</v>

18
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.160
<v Speaker 2>but that's a moment of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

19
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all the world's best skiing,</v>

20
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 2>incredible snow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful mountains.</v>

21
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 2>I leave my front door and in eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes I'm in remote wilderness on a </v>

22
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 2>run or hike or with my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really great.</v>

23
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Great State.</v>

24
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 1>So tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk a little bit about </v>

25
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Utah generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tell me just a little bit about your</v>

26
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>family and upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>FIFTH-GENERATION UTAH.</v>

27
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

28
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ancestors go back to the first person</v>

29
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:29.780
<v Speaker 2>to even make it into the valley ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brigham Young.</v>

30
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 2>He was a scout for Brigham young snakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Orson Pratt and he was head of the </v>

31
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:38.570
<v Speaker 2>pioneer trail and I looked into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>valley and said,</v>

32
00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 2>this is the place even before officially</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brigham Young said this is the place.</v>

33
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 2>So he had actually started planting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrigating before Brigham young and the </v>

34
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 2>rest of them came in.</v>

35
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And tell me just a little bit about your</v>

36
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.400
<v Speaker 1>upbringing and family and that's it.</v>

37
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

38
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of fell into politics,</v>

39
00:01:55.341 --> 00:02:00.341
<v Speaker 2>not by choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was the mayor of Salt Lake City </v>

40
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:03.011
<v Speaker 2>in the seventies and eighties and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a kid of the mayor that would go with </v>

41
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 2>them around town and to visit the banker</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

42
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 2>the local religious leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whomever.</v>

43
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 2>And I guess I have the five kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up being the one that stuck with</v>

44
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>this affliction affliction,</v>

45
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.650
<v Speaker 1>so like for a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know it's just as you as a kid,</v>

46
00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>it's just your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a child of a,</v>

47
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 2>well my dad was a people person still is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that helped a bed.</v>

48
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a busy life to have a parent who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>running and on the ballot and I think my</v>

49
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 2>kids are now living that with me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bit of,</v>

50
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I think stress with that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a typical life,</v>

51
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:42.651
<v Speaker 2>but it's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel really lucky to have had that </v>

52
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 2>experience and got to know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

53
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 2>My Mom's a small business owner and </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists and gallery owner,</v>

54
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 2>so I was able to kind of go to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>business too as a kid growing up and was</v>

55
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 2>really a great life.</v>

56
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were,</v>

57
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 1>we were talking right before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had a bunch of jobs,</v>

58
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>also politics that have sort of led you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this.</v>

59
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Can you give me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a couple of those that you've,</v>

60
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>you've bounced around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done some stuff.</v>

61
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

62
00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

63
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 2>back to the day that my dad was running </v>
<v Speaker 2>was always thrown into the campaign and </v>

64
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.611
<v Speaker 2>then in 1988 he ran for governor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my first real job and they </v>

65
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:17.180
<v Speaker 2>actually paid me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the press secretary.</v>

66
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.410
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

67
00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:23.411
<v Speaker 2>I can make a living doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it sort of helped in 1988 a define </v>

68
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:28.121
<v Speaker 2>my politics a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some of the relationships I had </v>

69
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:28.130
<v Speaker 2>on that campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I ended up</v>

70
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.260
<v Speaker 1>a little bit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what were some of the four major </v>

71
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.260
<v Speaker 1>formative?</v>

72
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

73
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well Utah's a very homogenous state.</v>

74
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.940
<v Speaker 2>So I think we were the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

75
00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:40.730
<v Speaker 2>So we were sort of the calendar to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>was out there.</v>

76
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.750
<v Speaker 2>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 2>environmental preservation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a balancing government is important I </v>

78
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.631
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the principles of </v>

79
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:52.631
<v Speaker 2>that campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

80
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.120
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of fell into it.</v>

81
00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:58.121
<v Speaker 2>Ended up on Capitol Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked initially for a congressman </v>

82
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:59.330
<v Speaker 2>from Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less a coin and 90.</v>

83
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.390
<v Speaker 2>And then in [inaudible] 92,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was running for the US Senate.</v>

84
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 2>I joined that race in Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was defeated and I ended up working </v>

85
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.770
<v Speaker 2>after that for Congressman from Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

86
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:12.920
<v Speaker 2>initially as press secretary and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>became his chief of staff.</v>

87
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.510
<v Speaker 2>His name is Bill Orton and unfortunately</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a blue dog,</v>

88
00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>

89
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.020
<v Speaker 2>democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

90
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.460
<v Speaker 2>What does happen</v>

91
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 1>been to the old school of Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously we're going to talk </v>

92
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>about your politics and I did a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>digging here and I think there,</v>

93
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>there's some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some points of agreement that we</v>

94
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>have for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I wish out of the Democrats is that</v>

95
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:39.931
<v Speaker 1>the old school Democrats still existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I've seen consistently is that as </v>

96
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:44.521
<v Speaker 1>the progressives have gone further left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say it's really out there </v>

97
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've sort of taken the whole party in</v>

98
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.420
<v Speaker 1>any of the moderates are the blue dogs </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever you want to call that wing.</v>

99
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're either silent or they're gone </v>

100
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's a fair estimation </v>

101
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.311
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or how would you even define some of </v>

102
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:02.311
<v Speaker 1>these things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a blue dog,</v>

103
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:02.311
<v Speaker 1>Democrat versus progressive?</v>

104
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a.</v>

105
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.980
<v Speaker 2>In the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my memories of Bill Orton and </v>

106
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately he passed away a few years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

107
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 2>but I'm used to pretty young a </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressman in the day and I worked with</v>

108
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:17.491
<v Speaker 2>him for about four years and he was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the budget committee and the Banking </v>

109
00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Committee and very concerned about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficit.</v>

110
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.820
<v Speaker 2>So that had a great impression on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot about title might reform</v>

111
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:29.491
<v Speaker 2>about discretionary spending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about our choices and I do think that as</v>

112
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:33.080
<v Speaker 2>we see the deficit and the debt go up an</v>
<v Speaker 2>APP,</v>

113
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

114
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their deficit as you know,</v>

115
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 2>is tied to economic prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we do well,</v>

116
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 2>our deficits are not as high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our overall debt keeps increasing.</v>

117
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.970
<v Speaker 2>So I really feel that we need to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to some discipline and I think that</v>

118
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:50.540
<v Speaker 2>that has been missed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

119
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.590
<v Speaker 2>in recent years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I work on a Salt Lake County </v>

120
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Council.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an elected now and we do balance the</v>

121
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:02.681
<v Speaker 2>budget every year and it's much tougher </v>
<v Speaker 2>in years where we have economic decline </v>

122
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.440
<v Speaker 2>and those are the years we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

123
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.780
<v Speaker 2>do maybe some of the nice to haves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we need to get back to more </v>

124
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 2>of a fluid budget process where congress</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize,</v>

125
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 2>recognizes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

126
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 2>this isn't such a good year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we find a different way of budgeting</v>

127
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 2>so that we don't always give away things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can afford?</v>

128
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible</v>

129
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 1>perhaps at the local level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>state level,</v>

130
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:31.060
<v Speaker 1>city level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

131
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 1>And just not possible anymore on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal level because when you sit,</v>

132
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:40.091
<v Speaker 1>talk about fiscal responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds so foreign to me as a </v>

133
00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the way,</v>

134
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 1>the republicans are horrible attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

135
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:43.360
<v Speaker 1>look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

136
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

137
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 1>the omni bus that was just passed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

138
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.070
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not even defending Any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have some of the principles that </v>

139
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.311
<v Speaker 1>should make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in a way they deserve more </v>

140
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:54.650
<v Speaker 1>criticism because it's part of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>package where it's a little less.</v>

141
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 1>So for democrat,</v>

142
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.180
<v Speaker 2>well I think the division in Washington </v>
<v Speaker 2>is forced budget reconciliation rather </v>

143
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.021
<v Speaker 2>than true budgets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how can you reprioritize when you </v>

144
00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 2>are just on the fly saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

145
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:08.180
<v Speaker 2>another two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go two more days.</v>

146
00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 2>So let's come back next week and fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

147
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.250
<v Speaker 2>So that's my concern is that we're at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point with so much division that </v>

148
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.121
<v Speaker 2>we're not having real conversations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think there's a baseline budget if </v>

149
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 2>we were to go maybe even to a two year </v>
<v Speaker 2>budget cycle,</v>

150
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 2>we're really find a way to force </v>
<v Speaker 2>congress into actually true debate about</v>

151
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:30.581
<v Speaker 2>what are our priorities because we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>are frustrated with the federal </v>

152
00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not serving us,</v>

153
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 2>it's not serving us at the local level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

154
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm not someone who wouldn't say that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to spend.</v>

155
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:41.501
<v Speaker 2>I think we do need to invest in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities and there's so many things </v>

156
00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:46.271
<v Speaker 2>that the federal government can do to </v>
<v Speaker 2>support us at the local level and </v>

157
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:49.151
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it's just rubber stamping what </v>

158
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 2>was done the year before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at last minute.</v>

159
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.220
<v Speaker 2>It's chaotic and it's not efficient.</v>

160
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is the right amount of</v>

161
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.330
<v Speaker 1>power for the federal government to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the states?</v>

162
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:02.650
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my audience that leans a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>more libertarian or classical liberal or</v>

163
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:03.610
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

164
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.940
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the key issues for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have to get this stuff back to </v>

165
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Speaker 1>the local municipalities and I'm pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

166
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I feel really good about the role</v>

167
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

168
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.930
<v Speaker 2>I have at the local level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that there are certain things</v>

169
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:21.931
<v Speaker 2>that I'm really matter to us as a nation</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have to have in place.</v>

170
00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:24.280
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course being defense,</v>

171
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.510
<v Speaker 2>our interstate system and our highways </v>
<v Speaker 2>and our connectivity and commerce.</v>

172
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.720
<v Speaker 2>There's so many things that if we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be isolationists state to state </v>

173
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.381
<v Speaker 2>really jeopardize our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our ability to act as a super power,</v>

174
00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:41.650
<v Speaker 2>the one that we are to be really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm the best of our nation,</v>

175
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.410
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot of things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do locally.</v>

176
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worry a little about too much,</v>

177
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diversion when you look at education.</v>

178
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want there to be a decision that</v>

179
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 2>we would go four days a week in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and not have basic standards.</v>

180
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 2>So I think a basic level of standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then let states decide.</v>

181
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:07.851
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got California here being very </v>

182
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:07.851
<v Speaker 2>different than Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different than,</v>

183
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a southern state or New York.</v>

184
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 2>So I'm basically there on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

185
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 2>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

186
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 2>I would want to kick all of education </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the states.</v>

187
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 2>But then people ask have totally legit </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

188
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 2>which I think is what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

189
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 2>what if states start really doing very </v>
<v Speaker 2>drastically different things?</v>

190
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 2>What I would say is that maximum </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom,</v>

191
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:29.331
<v Speaker 2>the ability to leave a state you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you don't like what they're </v>

192
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:29.331
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's the better answer.</v>

193
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:33.801
<v Speaker 2>But I guess getting some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some baseline I think is a is a sound </v>

194
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 2>or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

195
00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:40.671
<v Speaker 2>And I do think though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at the unique character of each </v>

196
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 2>of our states and we need to foster that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and find a way to,</v>

197
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:49.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really enable a state to do well on its </v>

198
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.060
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

199
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

200
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 2>we could start over would do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently,</v>

201
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:55.881
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we have to understand that in 2018 </v>

202
00:09:55.881 --> 00:09:56.730
<v Speaker 2>there are certain things that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>place that,</v>

203
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

204
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 2>the conversation needs to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we reform,</v>

205
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.510
<v Speaker 2>maybe not dismantle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we would do it </v>

206
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:05.510
<v Speaker 2>differently if we starteD over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish we would get back to some of that</v>

207
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do many things differently if we</v>

208
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 2>start over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what Virginia.</v>

209
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think there is a better way to </v>

210
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 2>fund medicaid and medicare and some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our big programs.</v>

211
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.350
<v Speaker 2>I do believe as a democrat and I believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly and fairness and compassion and</v>

212
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 2>the government being a tool that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>and should invest.</v>

213
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:31.761
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've ended up building year </v>

214
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:35.450
<v Speaker 2>after year after year on something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was created maybe for a good purpose at </v>

215
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.451
<v Speaker 2>one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is not as efficient as it needs to </v>

216
00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:38.451
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

217
00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I consider myself a reformer.</v>

218
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:44.631
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons I like what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is I have the opportunity to step in </v>

219
00:10:44.631 --> 00:10:49.121
<v Speaker 2>and look at how to make something better</v>
<v Speaker 2>and try and figure out a way to enact </v>

220
00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:50.520
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>View worry as someone that you're saying</v>

221
00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty content with the work that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing now and you've been able to</v>

222
00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:54.540
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

223
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:59.541
<v Speaker 2>we can't do this if we can't budget it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it all kind of make sense and you </v>

224
00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:02.971
<v Speaker 2>let the chips fall wheRe they may that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could end up going to the swamp </v>

225
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:07.250
<v Speaker 2>where it seems like nothing changes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't sell that fun to me to </v>

226
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.250
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There might be,</v>

227
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to maybe be on the national </v>

228
00:11:12.111 --> 00:11:12.270
<v Speaker 2>stage and play with more high rollers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that kind of thing,</v>

229
00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 2>but that you lose the real sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to,</v>

230
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.520
<v Speaker 2>to govern the way you would want it.</v>

231
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believed the senate can change,</v>

232
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 2>can change and that change will make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big difference.</v>

233
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to get back to the days where </v>
<v Speaker 2>orrin hatch for my state and ted kennedy</v>

234
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.820
<v Speaker 2>work together and solve problems and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were seeing too much polarization.</v>

235
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.520
<v Speaker 2>We don't have enough conversation on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>council.</v>

236
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:43.521
<v Speaker 2>We have five republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four democrats and we worked together </v>

237
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:46.800
<v Speaker 2>and I know that I have to go find that </v>
<v Speaker 2>first vote right.</v>

238
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a mathematician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

239
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:53.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the collegiality matters and listening </v>

240
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.511
<v Speaker 2>and trying and compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the tenor of politics in Utah </v>

241
00:11:56.511 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 2>right now is what's going on nationally </v>
<v Speaker 2>with just this endless craziness.</v>

242
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Is that happening to you guys at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>local level?</v>

243
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.250
<v Speaker 2>We tend to be a to five to 10 points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

244
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president's numbers and profile and </v>

245
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.660
<v Speaker 2>polling tends to be about 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher in favor in Utah.</v>

246
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.580
<v Speaker 2>So we still have a lot of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were pro trump.</v>

247
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm the core downtown salt lake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is our kind of more progressive </v>

248
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.111
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say the reverse of that </v>

249
00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 2>and our urban areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 50 slash 50,</v>

250
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.720
<v Speaker 2>so we're like a lot of states where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a very progressive kind of core </v>

251
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:36.270
<v Speaker 2>city and suburban area 50 slash 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you get to very conservative </v>

252
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a state that generally runs red,</v>

253
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:45.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that leans more conservative for </v>

254
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:45.270
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As someone that's running as a democrat,</v>

255
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the primary process like first as</v>

256
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:52.381
<v Speaker 2>a democrat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of people are you </v>

257
00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:52.381
<v Speaker 2>reading?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you wearing?</v>

258
00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:52.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>

259
00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:56.341
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years ago there was a very much a </v>

260
00:12:56.341 --> 00:12:57.600
<v Speaker 2>strong bernie sanders presence in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>state because,</v>

261
00:12:57.601 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lds church has a lot of dominance.</v>

262
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.960
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people who speak out </v>
<v Speaker 2>forcefully against the one party system,</v>

263
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:07.000
<v Speaker 2>which is generally what we have in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

264
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.630
<v Speaker 2>And so you get some pretty progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

265
00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:15.631
<v Speaker 2>And we were an 80 slash 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bernie sanders state to hillary </v>

266
00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:15.650
<v Speaker 2>clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

267
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

268
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.620
<v Speaker 2>things have sort of calmed down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would expect that just because of the </v>

269
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 2>nature of a democrat at that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the state liens so far.</v>

270
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 2>The other way that if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say you're a democrat,</v>

271
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 2>you may as well go all in on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally,</v>

272
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we alsO,</v>

273
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:36.631
<v Speaker 2>like every state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have our own nomination process and </v>

274
00:13:36.631 --> 00:13:38.120
<v Speaker 2>the republicans have a closed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican system,</v>

275
00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:41.770
<v Speaker 2>so you have to affiliate with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican with an r on the voter file.</v>

276
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.100
<v Speaker 2>And so therefore there are actually are </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of independence who are actually </v>

277
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 2>filing as republicans because they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to vote that way.</v>

278
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.510
<v Speaker 2>And with that party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your policy on that?</v>

279
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.980
<v Speaker 2>For the open or closed prison?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

280
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

281
00:13:55.001 --> 00:14:00.001
<v Speaker 2>We've debated it on the democratic side </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because the democrats are few and </v>

282
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:01.480
<v Speaker 2>far between in my state we register at </v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

283
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:06.481
<v Speaker 2>25 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do pull independence as I </v>

284
00:14:06.481 --> 00:14:06.481
<v Speaker 2>mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

285
00:14:06.481 --> 00:14:10.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not in the driver's seat and some </v>

286
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.181
<v Speaker 2>of those policies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we just sort of work with whatever </v>

287
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 2>makes sense because we're not in the one</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do anything.</v>

288
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:18.541
<v Speaker 2>But that always strikes me as one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things where it's like the closed </v>

289
00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:22.440
<v Speaker 2>primary does make sense to me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's to nominate who you want out of </v>

290
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 2>that party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you just have an open primary,</v>

291
00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:29.761
<v Speaker 2>well you could get all sorts of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who will never vote for any of those </v>

292
00:14:29.761 --> 00:14:32.911
<v Speaker 2>candidates purposely getting into help </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidates that they think are going to </v>

293
00:14:32.911 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 2>be more handicapped ultimately.</v>

294
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:38.630
<v Speaker 2>So I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people think that the </v>

295
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.441
<v Speaker 2>closed primary thing is somehow a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy or anti democratic or </v>

296
00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:41.150
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't have a problem with.</v>

297
00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:44.800
<v Speaker 2>The problem is what do you do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>independence because most people tend to</v>

298
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.650
<v Speaker 2>affiliate independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people I know,</v>

299
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are people like you and me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

300
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:54.610
<v Speaker 2>and elected or in meeting or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>that tend to be the insiders who </v>

301
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:59.230
<v Speaker 2>obviously follow this and get very </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply entrenched and every step of the </v>

302
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.400
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

303
00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I think most utahns are sort of in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle and uh,</v>

304
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:07.871
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets a little confusing because if </v>

305
00:15:07.871 --> 00:15:10.301
<v Speaker 2>we close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both them weren't as an independent </v>

306
00:15:10.301 --> 00:15:10.301
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IndependenT does nothing.</v>

307
00:15:10.301 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Or you can see the independents can vote</v>
<v Speaker 2>in either,</v>

308
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:14.210
<v Speaker 2>but then why wouldn't anyone voted </v>
<v Speaker 2>register as a,</v>

309
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.450
<v Speaker 2>as an independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

310
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's no easy answer on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

311
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our big battle in the republican party </v>

312
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.420
<v Speaker 2>right now is whether or not we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do away with the caucus system and go</v>

313
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Speaker 2>to the conventions rather and go to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct primary.</v>

314
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:29.960
<v Speaker 2>So that's our battle right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a two tiered system you can pick</v>

315
00:15:29.961 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 2>either now and that's under review.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are some of the other issues?</v>

316
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything else in Utah that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just see as like,</v>

317
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 2>just like the technical stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technical problems related to voting</v>

318
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:43.720
<v Speaker 2>or districting gerrymandering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing,</v>

319
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.850
<v Speaker 2>but someone that's on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gerrymander,</v>

320
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:51.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a very big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we have wacky maps like a lot </v>

321
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.220
<v Speaker 2>of states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

322
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a ballot initiative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so share one is a,</v>

323
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:59.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>redistricting commission ballot </v>

324
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.051
<v Speaker 2>initiative that should likely passed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got the required signatures to get </v>

325
00:16:02.051 --> 00:16:02.051
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

326
00:16:02.051 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 2>It seemed so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

327
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:07.750
<v Speaker 2>that would require that the legislature </v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to a redistricting commission </v>

328
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:12.761
<v Speaker 2>that makes the recommendation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the decision does lie in the hands </v>

329
00:16:12.761 --> 00:16:13.810
<v Speaker 2>of the legislature in our state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

330
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 2>So whAt are some of the other democratic</v>
<v Speaker 2>principles,</v>

331
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:21.581
<v Speaker 2>layout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some democratic good old democratic </v>

332
00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:21.581
<v Speaker 2>principles in you nash?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

333
00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:25.530
<v Speaker 2>just personally for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the things that you believe in.</v>

334
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 2>I've affiliated with the democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>party because I think that the party has</v>

335
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:34.631
<v Speaker 2>been the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one has battled for fairness and </v>

336
00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:34.631
<v Speaker 2>compassion over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

337
00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I have been pro lgbtq rights from day </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

338
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I was the first time I council to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>

339
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:45.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>local policies we did even before my </v>

340
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.040
<v Speaker 2>election to the county council years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

341
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:47.430
<v Speaker 2>four years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

342
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.480
<v Speaker 2>housing nondiscrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't have medical fairness in </v>

343
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:52.480
<v Speaker 2>terms of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

344
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.260
<v Speaker 2>health care plans at salt lake county.</v>

345
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:59.590
<v Speaker 2>So when I was first elected in 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved that and I couldn't get a </v>

346
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.911
<v Speaker 2>republican vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it took several takes trying to </v>

347
00:17:03.911 --> 00:17:08.050
<v Speaker 2>redefine the benefits and ultimately we </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up passing it six three with a </v>

348
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.550
<v Speaker 2>republican supporting us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

349
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think issues like that have been key.</v>

350
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons I think I'm so active</v>

351
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 2>in politics in my state is that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have balance,</v>

352
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in my dad's era in the seventies,</v>

353
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 2>we did have a republican governor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a democratic governor rather.</v>

354
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been since the seventies since we </v>

355
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.420
<v Speaker 2>had a democrat in the us senate from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>state of Utah.</v>

356
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's the person that orrin hatch </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeated.</v>

357
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:40.030
<v Speaker 2>So I really believe that good government</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a balanced government and we live it </v>

358
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.990
<v Speaker 2>and see it on my county council again </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>

359
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.190
<v Speaker 2>can I have five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four?</v>

360
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.460
<v Speaker 2>We have a democratic county executive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it a mayor and so we're,</v>

361
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're in a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>position in my day job now to bring </v>

362
00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:58.491
<v Speaker 2>about fairness and balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're 80 slash 20 and our </v>

363
00:17:58.491 --> 00:18:02.751
<v Speaker 2>legislature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are republican governor and so on </v>

364
00:18:02.751 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of what I fight for is balance.</v>

365
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes sense for good </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

366
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.290
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting too to stake out </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions that,</v>

367
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:12.810
<v Speaker 2>you know are not the popular ones there </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

368
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:17.760
<v Speaker 2>just so that the system doesn't become </v>
<v Speaker 2>too corroded or,</v>

369
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.430
<v Speaker 2>or too stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what about.</v>

370
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.440
<v Speaker 2>So it sounds sort of like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're socially liberal and fiscally </v>

371
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:24.960
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>BaSic.</v>

372
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

373
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.860
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where were you at on abortion?</v>

374
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm pro choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

375
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I believe that that women should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that right to choose.</v>

376
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.400
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more I've learneD about younger </v>

377
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:40.400
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

378
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own years with friends growing up,</v>

379
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I see at times women who don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>security that I've had my entire life </v>

380
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:52.280
<v Speaker 2>with good parents and support are often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

381
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.380
<v Speaker 2>pray to being victimized.</v>

382
00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:00.380
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that a woman's right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose is very much critical because of </v>

383
00:19:01.351 --> 00:19:03.300
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that,</v>

384
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

385
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:09.380
<v Speaker 2>in a very conservative state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had situations to support my sister</v>

386
00:19:10.321 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 2>who carried her child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been friends with.</v>

387
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:18.531
<v Speaker 2>People have made different decisions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just fundamentally believe that women </v>

388
00:19:18.531 --> 00:19:22.250
<v Speaker 2>need to be in the driver's seat on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision and we can't go back to the </v>

389
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.070
<v Speaker 2>days of real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real tragedies.</v>

390
00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prior to roe versus wade.</v>

391
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Do you see a cutoff point on it or were </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on that?</v>

392
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

393
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:35.571
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's a decision for </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and I think the courts have </v>

394
00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 2>landed through roe versus Wade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

395
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.320
<v Speaker 2>that's the best I can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but follow what we have in place now.</v>

396
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.310
<v Speaker 2>And I just don't think in 2018 we can go</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in time.</v>

397
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.070
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because that's one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones where I've heard,</v>

398
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:55.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's a lot of mormons in </v>

399
00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.601
<v Speaker 2>Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hear a lot of people that talk </v>

400
00:19:56.601 --> 00:19:56.601
<v Speaker 2>about the flyover states and they say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

401
00:19:56.601 --> 00:19:58.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the christian conservatives are</v>

402
00:19:58.021 --> 00:20:00.090
<v Speaker 2>just voting on that no matter what.</v>

403
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.090
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

404
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a position where you as someone not</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling the conservative line on that,</v>

405
00:20:05.251 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>that that's a serious uphill battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

406
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:13.041
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the lds church is </v>

407
00:20:13.041 --> 00:20:16.080
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally a very compassionate </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and I think that,</v>

408
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:21.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is compassion I think kind of can </v>

409
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 2>mitigate that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it has actually the lds church,</v>

410
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.800
<v Speaker 2>its position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape,</v>

411
00:20:25.801 --> 00:20:30.801
<v Speaker 2>incest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life of the mother is actually a little </v>

412
00:20:30.801 --> 00:20:32.250
<v Speaker 2>more progressive than some religions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of,</v>

413
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how involved they've been in with gay </v>

414
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:37.280
<v Speaker 2>marriage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really talked about anymore.</v>

415
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.430
<v Speaker 2>It's the law of the land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

416
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:40.830
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of a boring topic for me at </v>
<v Speaker 2>some level.</v>

417
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did have certain influence in </v>

418
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 2>the whole national debate about over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

419
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:53.221
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the lds church has come along </v>

420
00:20:53.221 --> 00:20:56.420
<v Speaker 2>way in terms of basic rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but marriage is obviously a death,</v>

421
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:20:57.431 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 2>a defining line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

423
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:06.210
<v Speaker 2>and in this era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given we have marriage equality </v>

424
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.380
<v Speaker 2>nationally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see how they step up and you'll,</v>

425
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.470
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there tend to be very,</v>

426
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:14.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open right now to more um,</v>

427
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.920
<v Speaker 2>lgbtq people involved in church services</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really sending a message of love thy</v>

428
00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 2>neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I appreciate that.</v>

429
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

430
00:21:23.301 --> 00:21:25.080
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to me because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

431
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.370
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy to bash mormons and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in comedy all the time.</v>

432
00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:29.950
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadway had the book of mormon.</v>

433
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even see the book of mormon </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

434
00:21:31.401 --> 00:21:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I heard it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see it,</v>

435
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you can make that show </v>
<v Speaker 1>very easily.</v>

436
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:41.250
<v Speaker 1>There are certain books you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to talk about that we'd never </v>

437
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.451
<v Speaker 1>make it on broadway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I always find like this need to bash </v>

438
00:21:43.451 --> 00:21:44.870
<v Speaker 1>mormons all the time where it's like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy joke all the time.</v>

439
00:21:44.871 --> 00:21:49.871
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe they're actually not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerant people because you have a </v>

440
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 1>very easy time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A joking.</v>

441
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

442
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Well you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm baptized lds and um,</v>

443
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.880
<v Speaker 2>I have a great relationship with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends who were still going to church </v>

444
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.570
<v Speaker 2>regularly and my family members who are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's a,</v>

445
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I love any religion that lifts people up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are times where I disagree </v>

446
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 2>with churches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

447
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:14.701
<v Speaker 2>I would very much defend separation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>church and state and there are times </v>

448
00:22:14.701 --> 00:22:16.750
<v Speaker 2>where I might raise an eyebrow and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

449
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Speaker 2>This seems like it's overstepping a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>

450
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:24.210
<v Speaker 2>but I do appreciate the lds churches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible force for good in the youtube</v>

451
00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:29.301
<v Speaker 2>community by um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>services and by creating a lot of </v>

452
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.270
<v Speaker 2>support within our salt lake city area </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

453
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:35.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

454
00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:40.531
<v Speaker 2>there's a food bank for members and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it open to people who are in </v>

455
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:43.660
<v Speaker 2>general need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's a,</v>

456
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:48.780
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at times I would have some differences </v>

457
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.541
<v Speaker 2>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I support the role in that and the </v>

458
00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:54.660
<v Speaker 2>commitment and anybody who chooses to </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice religion and it lives up their </v>

459
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.230
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>

460
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So would you,</v>

461
00:22:57.401 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 1>so because you're talking about all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good things that the church does,</v>

462
00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.820
<v Speaker 1>would you kick some of those social </v>
<v Speaker 1>services back to churches and synagogues</v>

463
00:23:05.891 --> 00:23:08.980
<v Speaker 1>and mosques and everything else if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had the power to do so?</v>

464
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Because to me I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

465
00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:15.571
<v Speaker 1>as a small government guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would see at it sounds </v>

466
00:23:15.571 --> 00:23:15.571
<v Speaker 1>like some of that's happened.</v>

467
00:23:15.571 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we do that.</v>

468
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:20.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worry about the tax bill now because </v>

469
00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:20.701
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to get a ride off </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

470
00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:22.150
<v Speaker 2>We're going to see how charitable people</v>
<v Speaker 2>really are,</v>

471
00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

472
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.750
<v Speaker 2>But we do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we always,</v>

473
00:23:25.751 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

474
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work that I'm able to do on the salt</v>

475
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:31.860
<v Speaker 2>lake county council when we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

476
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.280
<v Speaker 2>a business leader step up and support </v>
<v Speaker 2>something a little bit of county dollars</v>

477
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:41.281
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have a public private </v>

478
00:23:41.281 --> 00:23:41.290
<v Speaker 2>partnership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we see a lot of that now.</v>

479
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Could we take it further perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we get that then get into,</v>

480
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:50.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incentives and benefits and what I want </v>

481
00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.771
<v Speaker 2>to see in the community and what drives </v>
<v Speaker 2>me is problem solving and I don't think </v>

482
00:23:53.771 --> 00:23:56.060
<v Speaker 2>the government is always the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>vehicle for solving those problems.</v>

483
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do have businesses,</v>

484
00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:00.560
<v Speaker 2>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

485
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:05.420
<v Speaker 2>the web of all of that to solve a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and do it creatively.</v>

486
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy doing that at the local level </v>

487
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:10.530
<v Speaker 2>and I think the federal level we can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that better and do more.</v>

488
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.880
<v Speaker 1>What kind of support or not support are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you getting out of the dnc?</v>

489
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.530
<v Speaker 1>They got a whole slew of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

490
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

491
00:24:17.621 --> 00:24:19.540
<v Speaker 2>so I just got the nomination</v>

492
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:26.530
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the record a little bit after </v>

493
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:26.530
<v Speaker 1>when we're taping it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

494
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

495
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.031
<v Speaker 2>So I just recently received the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nomination so I have not had anybody.</v>

496
00:24:32.141 --> 00:24:35.050
<v Speaker 2>The doorbell rang and a big check from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dance see by any means.</v>

497
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.110
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had conversations with the dscc.</v>

498
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:43.410
<v Speaker 2>I've been invited to tour the city here </v>
<v Speaker 2>in la and san francisco and seattle with</v>

499
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.160
<v Speaker 2>some of the us senators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

500
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was a very educational for me </v>

501
00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.221
<v Speaker 2>and a great benefit to have some time </v>
<v Speaker 2>with our three or four or five of our us</v>

502
00:24:56.531 --> 00:24:59.230
<v Speaker 2>senators on the democratic side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aisle.</v>

503
00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:03.190
<v Speaker 2>And so I think just the conversations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that connection,</v>

504
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean fundamentally I think the </v>
<v Speaker 2>democrats are trying to take back the </v>

505
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.701
<v Speaker 2>senate and we'll see how things play out</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the next six months or so in my </v>

506
00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:15.931
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm hopeful that we'll get some </v>

507
00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:16.840
<v Speaker 2>significant national support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

508
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel though my,</v>

509
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:24.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>support should come from Utah and it is </v>

510
00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.300
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just get up every day and see what I </v>

511
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.500
<v Speaker 2>can do to bring a check in and get low </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar contributors to,</v>

512
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.790
<v Speaker 2>to get what they can and day to day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see what happens.</v>

513
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to me because it seems </v>

514
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:37.840
<v Speaker 1>like you're really in a unique position </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're,</v>

515
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you really seem to be fighting both </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>

516
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't want me to totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented that way,</v>

517
00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:44.810
<v Speaker 1>but you're obviously fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fighting the republican side as a</v>

518
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:46.550
<v Speaker 1>democrat in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

519
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:51.790
<v Speaker 1>in a red state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also what I mentioned earlier about </v>

520
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that the dnc and the </v>

521
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.130
<v Speaker 1>entire leadership from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.360
<v Speaker 1>bernie and Elizabeth Warren and Keith </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ellison and tom perez,</v>

523
00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:02.550
<v Speaker 1>like those guys seem way more left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the things you've talked about </v>

524
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:02.760
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't.</v>

525
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.970
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like why would they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support you?</v>

526
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Like your sort of against the stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of.</v>

527
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.120
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually tom perez has visited a couple </v>

528
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.791
<v Speaker 2>of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty committed to playing in </v>

529
00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:17.180
<v Speaker 2>every zip code and I think he's building</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards that.</v>

530
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:22.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean the republican party and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic party have different </v>

531
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.520
<v Speaker 2>influences within its governance </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

532
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:28.680
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't given up on the dnc paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to you.</v>

533
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I think they've done a good job in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past year and really engaging and </v>

534
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.021
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's most important to me is that we </v>

535
00:26:38.021 --> 00:26:41.921
<v Speaker 2>get to the point where I'm both parties </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually recognize that there cities and</v>

536
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 2>there are communities and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>small small towns aside from,</v>

537
00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>los angeles,</v>

538
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.460
<v Speaker 2>New York city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big cities in Florida,</v>

539
00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:55.290
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago were,</v>

540
00:26:55.291 --> 00:27:00.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people on the ground in my </v>

541
00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:00.291
<v Speaker 2>state in need with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the need government to lift them up or </v>

543
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.330
<v Speaker 2>need some support in some way from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

544
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.890
<v Speaker 2>community based networks.</v>

545
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 2>And I think that we have become both not</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

546
00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 2>and this isn't just the parties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington and how we govern,</v>

547
00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

548
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.620
<v Speaker 2>a little too focused I think on urban </v>
<v Speaker 2>centers.</v>

549
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we're just too reliant on </v>
<v Speaker 2>government in general that the answer </v>

550
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.010
<v Speaker 2>always seemed for both parties at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point?</v>

551
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:27.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple outliers.</v>

552
00:27:27.331 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I think rand paul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always bring it up.</v>

553
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 2>He's trying either you obviously have </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreements with him on the,</v>

554
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:36.970
<v Speaker 2>on the amount of government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I see him as someone that's </v>

555
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.381
<v Speaker 2>earnestly trying to fight for what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes in and usually falls short </v>

556
00:27:39.381 --> 00:27:40.440
<v Speaker 2>because the system doesn't allow it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

557
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

558
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 2>but that argument of how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

559
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:49.191
<v Speaker 2>we always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer seems to always be more </v>

560
00:27:49.191 --> 00:27:49.191
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

561
00:27:49.191 --> 00:27:53.241
<v Speaker 2>I think that we have to get back to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty major changes back to reinventing</v>

562
00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:58.281
<v Speaker 2>things because what I do when I look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and what's possible,</v>

563
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 2>let's look at what we have on the table.</v>

564
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned in the nineties when I worked </v>

565
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:07.320
<v Speaker 2>for a congressman that things don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen quickly and I wish we could,</v>

566
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:12.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out the etch a sketch and shake it </v>

567
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.350
<v Speaker 2>and start over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

568
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

569
00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:17.631
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think sometimes around paul and </v>

570
00:28:17.631 --> 00:28:17.631
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

571
00:28:17.631 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to accept that,</v>

572
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do have challenges with a lot of </v>

573
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:27.030
<v Speaker 2>people in need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do have income inequality and we have</v>

574
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:29.280
<v Speaker 2>to address those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be nice,</v>

575
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I think to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Simply,</v>

576
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

577
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.360
<v Speaker 2>have a smaller federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>

578
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:41.450
<v Speaker 2>what are we to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we would take a step back in </v>

579
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 2>terms of progress for us all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we all want the same thing.</v>

580
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:46.920
<v Speaker 2>So we want people to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want them to get up every day,</v>

581
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a,</v>

582
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.820
<v Speaker 2>have a step towards self sufficiency or </v>
<v Speaker 2>get out,</v>

583
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.230
<v Speaker 2>make a living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not commit crime,</v>

584
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:55.830
<v Speaker 2>be happy.</v>

585
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all want the same thing.</v>

586
00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.220
<v Speaker 2>The question is how do we get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

587
00:28:59.221 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 2>So that is the question because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>latter part of that,</v>

588
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:06.321
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe all of those things and I </v>

589
00:29:06.321 --> 00:29:08.241
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really try not to impugn the motives </v>

590
00:29:08.241 --> 00:29:08.241
<v Speaker 2>of the people that I disagree with in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

591
00:29:08.241 --> 00:29:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Not talking about you but just in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

592
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.960
<v Speaker 2>But to me the answer to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to solve those problems would be just </v>

593
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.680
<v Speaker 2>the government keeps scaling back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep scaling back,</v>

594
00:29:16.681 --> 00:29:21.681
<v Speaker 2>keeps coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully private enterprise comes in </v>

595
00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:24.890
<v Speaker 2>and you give people more self reliance </v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to creating a system that </v>

596
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:29.301
<v Speaker 2>they kinda can't move out of because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think there's a lot of evidence for </v>

597
00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:33.231
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the great debate and that's </v>

598
00:29:33.231 --> 00:29:35.140
<v Speaker 2>the great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should we just have to look at,</v>

599
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:40.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've worked for a little while at a </v>

600
00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.010
<v Speaker 2>hospital that did an incredible amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ophthalmology research and I learned </v>

601
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:48.781
<v Speaker 2>a lot about research and development and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the federal government works through</v>

602
00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:54.631
<v Speaker 2>basic science and supports researchers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I look at our innovation and our </v>

603
00:29:54.631 --> 00:29:57.310
<v Speaker 2>nation and what we've done because we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>invested in that.</v>

604
00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.920
<v Speaker 2>So when you talk about smaller </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and you have to say,</v>

605
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:04.921
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where and what is the next step by the </v>

606
00:30:04.921 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 2>pure funding of science by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the record,</v>

607
00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:08.400
<v Speaker 2>either got a lot of books of scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>who had been on the street.</v>

608
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 2>We have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a lot of businesses </v>

609
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.550
<v Speaker 2>that receive benefits and support small </v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses on up.</v>

610
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

611
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.500
<v Speaker 2>we just allowed for a one point </v>
<v Speaker 2>$5,000,000,000,000</v>

612
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:24.540
<v Speaker 2>corporate tax cut without any </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirement that people return it to </v>

613
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.861
<v Speaker 2>wages and to growing companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see a lot of federal policies that</v>

614
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:34.231
<v Speaker 2>have overly supported business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think especially now in this era </v>

615
00:30:34.231 --> 00:30:36.520
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I looked at and did a back of the</v>

616
00:30:36.521 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 2>napkin on our own taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did quite a bit of assessment when the</v>

617
00:30:40.451 --> 00:30:45.451
<v Speaker 2>tax bill came out at the end of the year</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see what it would do for a family of </v>

618
00:30:45.451 --> 00:30:45.610
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a family of six,</v>

619
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 2>a larger Utah family and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of uS are.</v>

620
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:52.960
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get a big benefit from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and now the mitt romney's and a few</v>

621
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:57.700
<v Speaker 2>others will and I think why in this era </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to find a way to,</v>

622
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:02.680
<v Speaker 2>if we are going to do tax reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax simplification.</v>

623
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:04.980
<v Speaker 2>That was a principal we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>with her.</v>

624
00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

625
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call her,</v>

626
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:12.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call your tax accountant because he or </v>

627
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:12.330
<v Speaker 2>she is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make double now.</v>

628
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:12.330
<v Speaker 2>is there any</v>

629
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:16.050
<v Speaker 1>reason to believe that the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do these things?</v>

630
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you take just the general </v>

631
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.551
<v Speaker 1>stagnation we talked about in Washington</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of the congressmen who do </v>

632
00:31:23.551 --> 00:31:26.611
<v Speaker 1>nothing in the senators who've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>there forever and accomplish nothing or </v>

633
00:31:26.611 --> 00:31:30.661
<v Speaker 1>it's just endless fighting or all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that these people who often </v>

634
00:31:30.881 --> 00:31:35.200
<v Speaker 1>have never created any jobs and it never</v>
<v Speaker 1>really made anything happen.</v>

635
00:31:35.201 --> 00:31:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I conclude bernie in this for sure.</v>

636
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.780
<v Speaker 1>The idea that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are the ones that are gonna,</v>

637
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:44.800
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get the economy going </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it really comes from the people </v>

638
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 1>that comes from the local businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the small businesses,</v>

639
00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:46.680
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

640
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>congress should be listening to its </v>

641
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.260
<v Speaker 2>constituents and to it specialists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why there's nothing that offended</v>

642
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:58.261
<v Speaker 2>me more than what happened with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare bill and the tax bill last </v>

643
00:31:58.261 --> 00:32:02.341
<v Speaker 2>time with no debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were some efforts for to </v>

644
00:32:02.341 --> 00:32:06.131
<v Speaker 2>have a bipartisan discussion around both</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the offenders was orrin hatch</v>

645
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:10.540
<v Speaker 2>who was trying to take and up down now </v>
<v Speaker 2>get outta here.</v>

646
00:32:10.541 --> 00:32:13.170
<v Speaker 2>We gotta get home and that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst.</v>

647
00:32:13.171 --> 00:32:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government to me,</v>

648
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.630
<v Speaker 2>because we should have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should have specialists in.</v>

649
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.810
<v Speaker 2>We should have a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't have lobbyists lined up and</v>

650
00:32:19.811 --> 00:32:24.811
<v Speaker 2>we should actually have methods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems to do what I do on the county </v>

651
00:32:24.811 --> 00:32:25.320
<v Speaker 2>council,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work with my colleagues,</v>

652
00:32:25.321 --> 00:32:30.321
<v Speaker 2>bring specialists in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to information and make good </v>

653
00:32:30.321 --> 00:32:30.321
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

654
00:32:30.321 --> 00:32:30.321
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

655
00:32:30.321 --> 00:32:33.750
<v Speaker 1>think you could probably draw a line </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the obamacare debate and how insane</v>

656
00:32:33.751 --> 00:32:37.620
<v Speaker 1>that guide to everything that has led us</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where we are at now.</v>

657
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Even during that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

658
00:32:38.671 --> 00:32:43.671
<v Speaker 1>the wouldn't sit down and we're goIng </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy the whole time and obama kept </v>

659
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:44.900
<v Speaker 1>saying in the reelection campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do it on cspan.</v>

660
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:49.901
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be open door cspan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like just the odd amount of </v>

661
00:32:51.051 --> 00:32:56.051
<v Speaker 1>congressmen and senators that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>retiring in the middle of it after they </v>

662
00:32:56.051 --> 00:32:56.051
<v Speaker 1>would make a decision or we need </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

663
00:32:56.051 --> 00:32:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Just seemed</v>

664
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.530
<v Speaker 2>about the whole thing and let's go fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

665
00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Let's go fix it and let's get back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>our real conversation and I,</v>

666
00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:10.270
<v Speaker 2>I guess I feel maybe from going back </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a full circle now to talking about</v>

667
00:33:10.271 --> 00:33:12.550
<v Speaker 2>my father again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in the seventies,</v>

668
00:33:12.551 --> 00:33:15.400
<v Speaker 2>in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things were more likely to happen.</v>

669
00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.560
<v Speaker 2>The collegiality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the discussion,</v>

670
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.800
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that led to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in this race was it like,</v>

671
00:33:22.931 --> 00:33:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I am a reformer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

672
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I like you want to fix things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to go back and have a voice in</v>

673
00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:32.470
<v Speaker 2>the system wherever I can find an ally </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

674
00:33:32.471 --> 00:33:35.260
<v Speaker 2>in doing some of the things you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggesting that we get down.</v>

675
00:33:35.261 --> 00:33:37.000
<v Speaker 2>We worked through these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

676
00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:39.070
<v Speaker 2>but I actually think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

677
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:44.310
<v Speaker 2>if that's too big a deal initially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least that I can serve my state.</v>

678
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:50.270
<v Speaker 2>And that was my major interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>running is I think that um,</v>

679
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.480
<v Speaker 2>we need a democrat from our delegation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have six ours.</v>

680
00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have six zero votes on everything and</v>

681
00:33:57.341 --> 00:34:00.610
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>community and in my state that are being</v>

682
00:34:00.611 --> 00:34:01.420
<v Speaker 2>served by that.</v>

683
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just quickly to reverse back to say,</v>

684
00:34:03.651 --> 00:34:08.651
<v Speaker 1>we talked about before about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were saying about being able to </v>

685
00:34:08.651 --> 00:34:09.580
<v Speaker 1>sit down with people have crossed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>iron ore that you mentioned right before</v>

686
00:34:09.581 --> 00:34:14.581
<v Speaker 1>we sat down that we have a mutual friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>in rick grinnell who I think as we're </v>

687
00:34:14.581 --> 00:34:16.900
<v Speaker 1>taping this today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think he just left for Germany.</v>

688
00:34:16.901 --> 00:34:21.901
<v Speaker 1>He was finally confirmed after over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year of waiting to be the ambassador of </v>

689
00:34:21.901 --> 00:34:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're both thrilled.</v>

690

<v Speaker 1>but he's a republican.</v>

691
00:34:25.411 --> 00:34:28.930
<v Speaker 1>He's a trump supporting republican or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>democrat from Utah.</v>

692
00:34:28.931 --> 00:34:30.280
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are friends.</v>

693
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.380
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

694
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does seem to be the thing that is </v>

695
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:37.570
<v Speaker 1>last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These.</v>

696
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

697
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I just don't get that and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have enough sense of my own </v>

698
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:45.391
<v Speaker 2>convictions that I'm not threatened by </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to dinner with republicans.</v>

699
00:34:45.931 --> 00:34:49.000
<v Speaker 2>So are working with them on a county </v>
<v Speaker 2>council and I'll tell you,</v>

700
00:34:49.001 --> 00:34:52.990
<v Speaker 2>there are times when the four democrats </v>
<v Speaker 2>look over at the other side of the aisle</v>

701
00:34:52.991 --> 00:34:53.980
<v Speaker 2>and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're done.</v>

702
00:34:53.981 --> 00:34:57.160
<v Speaker 2>We're out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we have those conversations.</v>

703
00:34:57.161 --> 00:35:02.161
<v Speaker 2>We work through our budget together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have some votes that are crossed </v>

704
00:35:02.161 --> 00:35:04.060
<v Speaker 2>party lines and others that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they typically are,</v>

705
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some are some days.</v>

706
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

707
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.440
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the reason that local </v>
<v Speaker 2>people or people who've worked at the </v>

708
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.030
<v Speaker 2>local level like myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to get to congress.</v>

709
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:21.330
<v Speaker 2>We need to get more and more people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>get government to have worked in </v>

710
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.730
<v Speaker 2>government who solve problems and come </v>
<v Speaker 2>in with that commitment to,</v>

711
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.290
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

712
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.430
<v Speaker 2>putting the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort,</v>

713
00:35:27.431 --> 00:35:29.710
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to moving things forward.</v>

714
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about the race you were </v>

715
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:34.900
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair to say this is an uphill battle.</v>

716
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.840
<v Speaker 2>I think so a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

717
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Just say</v>

718
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 1>just numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

719
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough</v>

720
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.700
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

721
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.530
<v Speaker 2>So at the republican convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone thought,</v>

722
00:35:43.531 --> 00:35:48.531
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least at the national level and </v>

723
00:35:48.531 --> 00:35:48.531
<v Speaker 2>thought mitt romney was going to walk in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and clean this thing up.</v>

724
00:35:48.531 --> 00:35:52.821
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy was the republican nominee for </v>

725
00:35:52.821 --> 00:35:54.981
<v Speaker 2>president not too long ago and has all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media behind him and all the money </v>

726
00:35:54.981 --> 00:35:55.230
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

727
00:35:55.231 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 2>but my kennedy one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know much about Mike Kennedy.</v>

728
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:03.291
<v Speaker 2>So could you just briefly tell me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit about him and then we'll </v>

729
00:36:03.291 --> 00:36:03.291
<v Speaker 2>focus more on the romney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>

730
00:36:03.291 --> 00:36:07.980
<v Speaker 2>He's a legislator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is kind of himself as conservative,</v>

731
00:36:08.111 --> 00:36:12.100
<v Speaker 2>more conservative than romney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Romney sort of been all over the place.</v>

732
00:36:12.101 --> 00:36:13.780
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

733
00:36:13.781 --> 00:36:16.120
<v Speaker 2>truly do not know mitt romney's </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

734
00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:21.220
<v Speaker 2>So my kennedy ran to the right of romney</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did pretty well at the convention.</v>

735
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Romney came in second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the two of them will go to a late </v>

736
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 2>june primary.</v>

737
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was pretty close.</v>

738
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 51 slash 49.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they will do a primary soon enough.</v>

739
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

740
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.280
<v Speaker 2>You would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to claire,</v>

741
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:34.950
<v Speaker 2>60 percent at your convention to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>the primary,</v>

742
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 2>which I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

743
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:42.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've cleared my with 81 percent and then</v>

744
00:36:43.141 --> 00:36:48.141
<v Speaker 2>there I've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The primary now you worked for romney a </v>

745
00:36:48.401 --> 00:36:49.210
<v Speaker 2>dead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

746
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

747
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:55.670
<v Speaker 2>I worked for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just said you don't know his </v>

748
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.670
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

749
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.491
<v Speaker 2>I thought I did at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I worked for the olympic games of </v>

750
00:36:58.491 --> 00:37:01.461
<v Speaker 2>2002.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had three or four of us who ran the </v>

751
00:37:01.461 --> 00:37:03.510
<v Speaker 2>volunteer program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recruitment retention training,</v>

752
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.990
<v Speaker 2>a 26,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>employees and volunteers on those games.</v>

753
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:10.140
<v Speaker 2>That made it a success and a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

754
00:37:10.141 --> 00:37:15.141
<v Speaker 2>So he was our chief executive and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>senior staff and I saw quite a bit of </v>

755
00:37:15.751 --> 00:37:20.340
<v Speaker 2>him and I was always a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous when we had the quarterly budget</v>

756
00:37:20.341 --> 00:37:25.341
<v Speaker 2>review with mitt romney was a big day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that like a businessman right </v>

757
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.160
<v Speaker 2>as a now we went end with our budgets </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how to defend our programs and he'd </v>

758
00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.230
<v Speaker 2>give us a up or down and I will say mit </v>
<v Speaker 2>did a good job of stabilizing the budget</v>

759
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.080
<v Speaker 2>and fundraising and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was good at.</v>

760
00:37:37.081 --> 00:37:39.060
<v Speaker 2>That is a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good person to work for.</v>

761
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.810
<v Speaker 1>But when you say you don't know what his</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics are like,</v>

762
00:37:41.811 --> 00:37:42.860
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

763
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:48.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he laughed right after the olympic </v>

764
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.150
<v Speaker 2>games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

765
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.290
<v Speaker 2>to Massachusetts to run for governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

766
00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:53.370
<v Speaker 2>he had run against ted kennedy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts for the senate years </v>

767
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:54.000
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So thIs was his,</v>

768
00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:59.001
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jump into political life again and he </v>

769
00:37:59.001 --> 00:38:02.760
<v Speaker 2>won that race and I started to watch and</v>
<v Speaker 2>was interested because I knew him and it</v>

770
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.330
<v Speaker 2>seemed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:38:04.331 --> 00:38:07.060
<v Speaker 2>he was going in as a progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor,</v>

772
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.370
<v Speaker 2>republican governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

773
00:38:09.371 --> 00:38:14.371
<v Speaker 2>he signed an assault weapon ban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was pro choice and uh,</v>

774
00:38:14.891 --> 00:38:19.891
<v Speaker 2>he got ruined in Massachusetts and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>not long after he ran for president was </v>

775
00:38:19.961 --> 00:38:23.230
<v Speaker 2>defeated and then president and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he ended up moving more and more and</v>

776
00:38:23.231 --> 00:38:24.760
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to the left,</v>

777
00:38:24.761 --> 00:38:25.900
<v Speaker 2>but it was actually to the right,</v>

778
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.470
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what people would say.</v>

779
00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.400
<v Speaker 1>People would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

780
00:38:30.401 --> 00:38:31.210
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

781
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he kind of start obamacare with </v>
<v Speaker 1>romney carried Massachusetts then was.</v>

782
00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:35.970
<v Speaker 1>And then it</v>

783
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.920
<v Speaker 2>was also running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

784
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.820
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

785
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.090
<v Speaker 2>And then we have the history with trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he was,</v>

786
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think delivered all wooded would agree</v>

787
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:45.650
<v Speaker 2>the most scathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

788
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.860
<v Speaker 2>speech against trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about his lack of values,</v>

789
00:38:48.861 --> 00:38:53.350
<v Speaker 2>his inability to govern and was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much in the amt.</v>

790
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Anybody but trump camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

791
00:38:56.951 --> 00:39:01.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw the sit down when there was some </v>

792
00:39:01.951 --> 00:39:02.730
<v Speaker 2>talk of secretary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

793
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:05.970
<v Speaker 2>He did not look happy and then it seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's back with trump or.</v>

794
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we're left with right now</v>

795
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:10.450
<v Speaker 2>to kind of work through that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

796
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Do you think when he had that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he gave that press </v>

797
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.510
<v Speaker 2>conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was late.</v>

798
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:16.010
<v Speaker 2>It looked like trump was gonna win no </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what,</v>

799
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:21.330
<v Speaker 2>but he gave that press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read it more as and I think perhaps </v>

800
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 2>the electorate did to that.</v>

801
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.540
<v Speaker 2>It was kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you lost this thing?</v>

802
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:30.541
<v Speaker 2>So why would we listen to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole thing with trump was </v>

803
00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:33.421
<v Speaker 2>about winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like anyone that liked trump </v>

804
00:39:33.421 --> 00:39:33.421
<v Speaker 2>wasn't going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

805
00:39:33.421 --> 00:39:34.750
<v Speaker 2>he is making a couple of good points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

806
00:39:34.751 --> 00:39:35.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were the loser.</v>

807
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:38.830
<v Speaker 2>They're trotting out the loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tried it with mccain,</v>

808
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:42.820
<v Speaker 2>we tried it with romney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tried it with more centrist people.</v>

809
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Even though I actually think trump is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of interesting,</v>

810
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.220
<v Speaker 2>his own bizarre way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a whole other topic.</v>

811
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:53.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of that just doesn't work </v>

812
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:53.610
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't fly anymore.</v>

813
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

814
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:58.231
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I look at romney and I feel like </v>

815
00:39:58.231 --> 00:40:00.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My biggest concern about a romney in the</v>

816
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:05.671
<v Speaker 2>senate is I think we just need somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Utah fighting for Utah and I think </v>

817
00:40:05.671 --> 00:40:09.220
<v Speaker 2>he's a national figure and I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

818
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.410
<v Speaker 2>if romney does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the senate race,</v>

819
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:14.470
<v Speaker 2>people will notice now that many have </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

820
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:16.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>romney is going to get a chairmanship,</v>

821
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.460
<v Speaker 2>or what is that realistic?</v>

822
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meAn,</v>

823
00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:24.421
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine a republican senator </v>
<v Speaker 2>stepping aside for romney to come and </v>

824
00:40:24.421 --> 00:40:24.421
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

825
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.130
<v Speaker 2>It also gets to the heart of what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the problem is.</v>

826
00:40:27.131 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're trying to get a guy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in there for Utah and it's like,</v>

827
00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:30.820
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>congratulations.</v>

828
00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:31.300
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

829
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to get those powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions,</v>

830
00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:36.130
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the position now to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>your state the most.</v>

831
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm from your tie.</v>

832
00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I know you tie work in the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

833
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

834
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:46.710
<v Speaker 2>I've lived there except for my time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate school and my time working on </v>

835
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.010
<v Speaker 2>the hill and the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lived there my entire life.</v>

836
00:40:48.011 --> 00:40:51.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm raising two children there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm first generation your time,</v>

837
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:54.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I recreate there.</v>

838
00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the state.</v>

839
00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that feeling was what </v>

840
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.710
<v Speaker 2>caused him not to win the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

841
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:02.770
<v Speaker 2>the convention?</v>

842
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it um,</v>

843
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:07.240
<v Speaker 2>because carpet bagging it kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

844
00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:12.241
<v Speaker 2>hillary was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to use it was a guard </v>

845
00:41:12.241 --> 00:41:12.900
<v Speaker 2>beggar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was from Arkansas and you know,</v>

846
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:17.990
<v Speaker 2>when he got in I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't actually thought warren hatch </v>

847
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:21.001
<v Speaker 2>would run again because he loves the </v>
<v Speaker 2>senate and he doesn't know anything </v>

848
00:41:21.001 --> 00:41:22.930
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I thought he might run again and um,</v>

849
00:41:22.931 --> 00:41:27.931
<v Speaker 2>when he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't make sense to me knowing </v>

850
00:41:27.931 --> 00:41:29.800
<v Speaker 2>that I'm at the sunset of his career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's had,</v>

851
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very successful career financially and</v>

852
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.950
<v Speaker 2>got kids and grandkids and I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

853
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:40.880
<v Speaker 2>at that point in my life I'd be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking to relax a little bit.</v>

854
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:45.881
<v Speaker 2>So it didn't seem to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think people when I worried a </v>

855
00:41:45.881 --> 00:41:47.570
<v Speaker 2>little as a candidate like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my goodness,</v>

856
00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 2>it was mitt romney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I even going to keep the lights on in</v>

857
00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 2>the campaign headquarters?</v>

858
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 2>And what I found is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>asking that question.</v>

859
00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

860
00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.400
<v Speaker 2>how long has he lived here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are even saying,</v>

861
00:41:58.401 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 2>does he meet residency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he does.</v>

862
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:03.650
<v Speaker 2>He's been in Utah long enough now again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

863
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.680
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that there are people </v>

864
00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:08.680
<v Speaker 2>wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.050
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

866
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:14.170
<v Speaker 2>why the mitt romney candidacy and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>may have been part of the reason that </v>

867
00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.460
<v Speaker 2>this division occurred within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican party.</v>

868
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:21.620
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting place as a democrat </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's so successful as a </v>

869
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:26.051
<v Speaker 2>businessman and generally democrats want</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks businessman more,</v>

870
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.990
<v Speaker 2>which is something you've already </v>
<v Speaker 2>alluded to here.</v>

871
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:34.430
<v Speaker 2>And yet at the same time you're also </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that he ran the olympic thing and</v>

872
00:42:34.431 --> 00:42:39.431
<v Speaker 2>the budget's pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like there's some piece that </v>

873
00:42:39.431 --> 00:42:43.631
<v Speaker 2>makes that a ton more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to give away more.</v>

874
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to this tax bill,</v>

875
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:48.920
<v Speaker 2>if we had the one chance to reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted it done differently,</v>

876
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.470
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

877
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

878
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:59.740
<v Speaker 2>we'll just see if the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you tie aligns with mitt romney </v>

879
00:43:00.621 --> 00:43:01.340
<v Speaker 2>candidacy.</v>

880
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I fundamentally believe in balance in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>state and that's what I've been fighting</v>

881
00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Speaker 2>for and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

882
00:43:06.861 --> 00:43:11.861
<v Speaker 2>in my day life as a county elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll work on canyon protection or you </v>

883
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:17.381
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>advancing a development or protecting </v>

884
00:43:17.381 --> 00:43:19.070
<v Speaker 2>our water and our air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do all of those things,</v>

885
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:23.810
<v Speaker 2>but I fundamentally am really fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a democrat for balance and it because</v>

886
00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really critical to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

887
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:30.800
<v Speaker 2>a less corrupt system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more even playing field.</v>

888
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 2>All voices heard in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a lot of women in politics</v>

889
00:43:34.761 --> 00:43:35.920
<v Speaker 2>in Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

890
00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.660
<v Speaker 2>when a lot of women in politics anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the us senate.</v>

891
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.960
<v Speaker 2>So I think getting more diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more diverse voices in is really </v>

892
00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.101
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the things I care quite a bit </v>

893
00:43:48.101 --> 00:43:50.621
<v Speaker 2>about and we'll see if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my vision for the state resonates with </v>

894
00:43:50.621 --> 00:43:54.641
<v Speaker 2>people versus romneys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm glad you mentioned that because </v>

895
00:43:54.641 --> 00:43:57.671
<v Speaker 2>one of my biggest issues right now with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the democrats and with the left and </v>

896
00:43:57.671 --> 00:44:01.661
<v Speaker 2>especially with the progressive than my </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole audience know this because I beat </v>

897
00:44:01.661 --> 00:44:01.730
<v Speaker 2>this thing endlessly is identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

898
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.590
<v Speaker 2>That you shouldn't be voting for a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because she's a woman.</v>

899
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.600
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be voting for a black </v>
<v Speaker 2>person just because they're black or </v>

900
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 2>white prison because they're white or </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of those ridiculous things.</v>

901
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.490
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity,</v>

902
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I think you sort of said it both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

903
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:17.600
<v Speaker 2>you want some more women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which ended up itself.</v>

904
00:44:17.601 --> 00:44:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's not a Bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that one I think always gets lost in</v>

905
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:26.681
<v Speaker 2>that is diversity of thought and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm more concerned about and I </v>

906
00:44:26.681 --> 00:44:29.780
<v Speaker 2>don't see anyone talking about that on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

907
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.060
<v Speaker 2>on the left anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

908
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:35.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I'm put jenny wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>democrat in x county council seat.</v>

909
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Take my colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jim bradley.</v>

910
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that jim's better edison </v>
<v Speaker 2>elected than.</v>

911
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:44.991
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He or I are better because of our </v>

912
00:44:44.991 --> 00:44:45.540
<v Speaker 2>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do judge you on your ideas.</v>

913
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

914
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.800
<v Speaker 2>But I do think what is preventing when </v>
<v Speaker 2>women make up 50 percent of the </v>

915
00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.490
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women from being in the pipeline,</v>

916
00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:58.820
<v Speaker 2>that's what we have to get out and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to figure out why we don't have </v>

917
00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.750
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

918
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 2>because ideally in a given body we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>see 50 slash 50.</v>

919
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:08.160
<v Speaker 2>now we are seeing a lot more women step </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in this era and we saw it in Utah and</v>

920
00:45:08.161 --> 00:45:09.820
<v Speaker 2>they weren't all progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

921
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.040
<v Speaker 2>we have a new mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>female of provo,</v>

922
00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the heart of a very,</v>

923
00:45:16.531 --> 00:45:18.920
<v Speaker 2>very conservative conservative area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hummer,</v>

924
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:23.930
<v Speaker 2>brigham young university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a woman at a small town not far </v>

925
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.010
<v Speaker 2>from salt lake city where I'm from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wIlla,</v>

926
00:45:26.011 --> 00:45:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's great,</v>

927
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:31.440
<v Speaker 2>but you hadn't seen that as often in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>state of Utah,</v>

928
00:45:31.441 --> 00:45:34.140
<v Speaker 2>which is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly caucasian,</v>

929
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:36.900
<v Speaker 2>caucasian men typically over 60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

930
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:42.230
<v Speaker 2>So I think that the voice of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>community is beyond that one segment.</v>

931
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.290
<v Speaker 2>So that's where I want to see people </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

932
00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:51.291
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it that would get me to step up </v>

933
00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:52.980
<v Speaker 2>to be considered within the system?</v>

934
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you think some of that is not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's just like old crusty white men</v>

935
00:45:57.651 --> 00:46:01.090
<v Speaker 1>doing it because I just think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's too sort,</v>

936
00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:06.091
<v Speaker 1>sorta too easy to lay it on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that perhaps also that women are </v>

937
00:46:06.091 --> 00:46:06.140
<v Speaker 1>interested in other things at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

938
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:11.180
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that we'd ever get it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>50 slash 50 or that it should be 50 </v>

939
00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.100
<v Speaker 1>slash 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems lIke very strange engineering</v>

940
00:46:13.101 --> 00:46:18.101
<v Speaker 1>of things like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if these women are qualified and have </v>

941
00:46:18.101 --> 00:46:19.130
<v Speaker 1>the right ideas and all that and it ends</v>
<v Speaker 1>up being 70 percent women,</v>

942
00:46:19.131 --> 00:46:21.000
<v Speaker 1>30 percent men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it.</v>

943
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I just don't care what it is other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas.</v>

944
00:46:23.451 --> 00:46:26.990
<v Speaker 1>But there's something that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people talk about what we should,</v>

945
00:46:26.991 --> 00:46:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like we should have this represent.</v>

946
00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.650
<v Speaker 1>They represent this amount of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

947
00:46:30.651 --> 00:46:35.651
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking about an ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have this amount of </v>

948
00:46:35.651 --> 00:46:37.931
<v Speaker 1>representation in politics that seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly dangerous and actually </v>

949
00:46:37.931 --> 00:46:38.030
<v Speaker 1>prejudice to me.</v>

950
00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that you have to look at,</v>

951
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barriers for participation.</v>

952
00:46:43.511 --> 00:46:48.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good news is we're seeing a lot of </v>

953
00:46:48.511 --> 00:46:48.511
<v Speaker 2>women have graduated from college now </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time,</v>

954
00:46:48.511 --> 00:46:50.530
<v Speaker 2>so maybe that will change over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

955
00:46:50.531 --> 00:46:55.531
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think there's something to be </v>

956
00:46:55.531 --> 00:46:57.421
<v Speaker 2>said for reform and change and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe we just disagree on this </v>

957
00:46:57.731 --> 00:47:01.240
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love to see more people reflecting</v>

958
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:05.920
<v Speaker 2>the percentages of our community serving</v>
<v Speaker 2>in government because I think I'm having</v>

959
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.560
<v Speaker 2>more voices for people who have lived a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way or have,</v>

960
00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:13.330
<v Speaker 2>have some understanding of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

961
00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual or kind of collective need </v>

962
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:18.360
<v Speaker 2>within a given community.</v>

963
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

964
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.540
<v Speaker 1>that part I think We probably have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree.</v>

965
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Agree to disagree on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the sort of collective need,</v>

966
00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:28.860
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I want it to be very clear that I </v>

967
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:33.151
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not every woman in the state of Utah </v>

968
00:47:33.151 --> 00:47:33.151
<v Speaker 2>needs to want to run for the us senate </v>
<v Speaker 2>for goodness sakes.</v>

969
00:47:33.151 --> 00:47:37.861
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I value women who choose to raise her </v>

970
00:47:37.861 --> 00:47:39.910
<v Speaker 2>children at home and have that option </v>
<v Speaker 2>within their family and that,</v>

971
00:47:39.911 --> 00:47:40.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

972
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:44.440
<v Speaker 2>my kids kind of tease me because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>missed sort of half a cook.</v>

973
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:49.441
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a very good and I looked at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman who I had are making like their </v>

974
00:47:49.441 --> 00:47:50.570
<v Speaker 2>home and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

975
00:47:50.571 --> 00:47:53.560
<v Speaker 2>and their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their environment for their family,</v>

976
00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:58.561
<v Speaker 2>just incredibly rich and interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the commitment they make and </v>

977
00:47:58.561 --> 00:48:03.481
<v Speaker 2>that way and I don't for a minute take </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything away from that because I </v>

978
00:48:03.481 --> 00:48:07.291
<v Speaker 2>haven't taken a different path and I try</v>
<v Speaker 2>my best and we have an abandoned my </v>

979
00:48:07.291 --> 00:48:09.240
<v Speaker 2>children by any means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

980
00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

981
00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

982
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I understand that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my mom,</v>

983
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I have two siblings so we have three </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids in my family and my parents were </v>

984
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:22.280
<v Speaker 1>married over 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom worked before she had kids,</v>

985
00:48:22.281 --> 00:48:27.281
<v Speaker 1>but then in all of our formative years </v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't and my dad was the sole </v>

986
00:48:27.281 --> 00:48:30.701
<v Speaker 1>breadwinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then after my sister who's the </v>

987
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:30.920
<v Speaker 1>youngest got to a certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom went back to work.</v>

988
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I look back on those years of my mom </v>
<v Speaker 1>being around and cook.</v>

989
00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.570
<v Speaker 1>We know we always had dinner at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff.</v>

990
00:48:38.571 --> 00:48:43.571
<v Speaker 1>Like I look at that as great and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain segment of society </v>

991
00:48:43.571 --> 00:48:43.571
<v Speaker 1>that kind of looks down on that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's so,</v>

992
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:48.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's impressive and </v>

993
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:50.390
<v Speaker 2>wonderful if stats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the point is that every</v>

994
00:48:50.391 --> 00:48:55.391
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he or she should grow up being whatever </v>

995
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:55.760
<v Speaker 2>they want to be and have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

996
00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 2>have a right to the american dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if in the american dream is staying </v>

997
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:04.190
<v Speaker 2>home and raising your kids and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do that financially,</v>

998
00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:06.560
<v Speaker 2>then that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's like me,</v>

999
00:49:06.561 --> 00:49:08.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make a difference in politics.</v>

1000
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I've had that advantage in my life to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>given,</v>

1001
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:12.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1002
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.140
<v Speaker 2>a platform to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's great.</v>

1003
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:18.530
<v Speaker 2>So I would hope that for a young woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1004
00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:21.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is high school or getting into college,</v>

1005
00:49:21.651 --> 00:49:24.770
<v Speaker 2>who aspires to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there won't be barriers in her way,</v>

1006
00:49:24.771 --> 00:49:29.771
<v Speaker 2>that she will be able to sit here with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and a few years and you'll be able </v>

1007
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:30.670
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that jenny wilson,</v>

1008
00:49:30.671 --> 00:49:32.420
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was written for you cracking.</v>

1009
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believing in equality of opportunity </v>

1010
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.780
<v Speaker 1>that everyone has the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>

1011
00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I am completely on board with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1012
00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.560
<v Speaker 1>anything else we should know about Utah?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We briefly tAlked about just the sort of</v>

1013
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:47.210
<v Speaker 1>demographic</v>

1014
00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.330
<v Speaker 2>we have to come visit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told him,</v>

1015
00:49:49.331 --> 00:49:50.890
<v Speaker 2>I know I've never been to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

1016
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:56.400
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like most people that I meet to have </v>

1017
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.740
<v Speaker 2>been there a good skier to ski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have five national parks.</v>

1018
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:04.770
<v Speaker 2>you can access our national parks </v>
<v Speaker 2>through vegas or Arizona or salt lake </v>

1019
00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:06.280
<v Speaker 2>city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or five hour drive south.</v>

1020
00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have amazing national parks.</v>

1021
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:13.450
<v Speaker 2>We have an agricultural area north up by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Idaho border,</v>

1022
00:50:13.451 --> 00:50:16.280
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of um,</v>

1023
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.780
<v Speaker 2>somewhat barren land around the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>salt lake area.</v>

1024
00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to fly over the lake because </v>

1025
00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.791
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you're on mars and there's </v>

1026
00:50:26.791 --> 00:50:26.860
<v Speaker 2>some water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks very,</v>

1027
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

1028
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.400
<v Speaker 1>The landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1030
00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 1>it's been a pleasure talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish you luck.</v>

1031
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:36.520
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got an uphill battle here in a </v>

1032
00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.231
<v Speaker 1>state that is not the color that you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everyone's obsessed with this </v>

1033
00:50:38.231 --> 00:50:39.200
<v Speaker 1>silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blue and red stuff.</v>

1034
