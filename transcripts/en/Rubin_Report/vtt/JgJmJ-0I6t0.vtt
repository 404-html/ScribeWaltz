1
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.873
<v Speaker 1>With six days left to the election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible how little public </v>

2
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>discourse this past year has had do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual issues.</v>

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Immigration has become a meme fest </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolving around trump's proposed wall.</v>

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.183
<v Speaker 1>Abortion was basically relegated to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>three minute exchange in the final </v>

5
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:21.384
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been virtually nothing on </v>

6
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>legalizing marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war on drugs or reforming our prison</v>

7
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foreign policy has been reduced to trump</v>

8
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:29.964
<v Speaker 1>saying he can't tell us what he's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do so that he doesn't tip anyone off </v>

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>versus Hillary promoting her experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of which was a disaster.</v>

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>There's been pretty much no talk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure or education,</v>

11
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>but a whole lot on genital grabbing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hacked emails.</v>

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.513
<v Speaker 1>My hope is that this is the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>election will ever have were seemingly </v>

13
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>every major issue is neglected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the minute he said she said,</v>

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>get center stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of all of this anger and frustration</v>

15
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>in general lunacy.</v>

16
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that something good </v>
<v Speaker 1>will rise from the ashes.</v>

17
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>The majority of us want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the real issues.</v>

18
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.044
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to demonize everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to be pandered to and we </v>

19
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:07.644
<v Speaker 1>do want to find solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got in this political mess this year </v>

20
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:11.694
<v Speaker 1>because for so long we've allowed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system to let the lowest common </v>

21
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:15.654
<v Speaker 1>denominator rise to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we needed this freak show to </v>

22
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>happen so that the masses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the silent majority,</v>

23
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>would finally wake up and realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually our lives,</v>

24
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>our welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our families on the line.</v>

25
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Every generation has something new to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight for and maybe for this generation,</v>

26
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>the fight will be to recreate a system </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the people and for the people.</v>

27
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.103
<v Speaker 1>That's why the next few years are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an incredibly important piece of </v>

28
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:40.644
<v Speaker 1>history where we sit back and let the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst of us continue to take control or </v>

29
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>will we fight back?</v>

30
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.733
<v Speaker 1>Will we find allies where we used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find enemies and what we stand for </v>

31
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>principles even when it's not popular to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do so.</v>

32
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that will do the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

33
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.393
<v Speaker 1>but the only way we'll do it is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>really discussing issues and not the </v>

34
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:00.174
<v Speaker 1>side show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's demand that our leaders explain </v>

35
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>why they believe in what they believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they vote,</v>

36
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:05.604
<v Speaker 1>the way they vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why they deserve the right to speak </v>

37
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:09.354
<v Speaker 1>for us as citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's step back from the scandals and </v>

38
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>the screaming and focus on education and</v>
<v Speaker 1>empowerment.</v>

39
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Politicians in the media aren't going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>magically just become better.</v>

40
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:19.254
<v Speaker 1>We have to demand that they do and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only way that we can demand it is if we </v>

41
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:23.754
<v Speaker 1>demand it from ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can start by being outspoken instead </v>

42
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:27.864
<v Speaker 1>of just outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This week we're continuing our </v>

43
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>collaboration with learn liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're teaming up with learn liberty once</v>

44
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.673
<v Speaker 1>a month to talk to professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought leaders and authors on a wide </v>

45
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:37.914
<v Speaker 1>variety of topics all related to free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech and classical liberalism to </v>

46
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>things we could certainly use a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of these days.</v>

47
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.143
<v Speaker 1>Joining me this week is Dr Steve Davies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Davis is head of education at the </v>

48
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.083
<v Speaker 1>Institute of Economic Affairs in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also a lecturer and a historian </v>

49
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>whose research includes crime and </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal justice,</v>

50
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>the history of ideas and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

51
00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>comparative economic</v>

52
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and much more.</v>

53
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.830
<v Speaker 2>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy knows his stuff and we're going</v>

54
00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 2>to get into all of it or at least as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as we can in an hour.</v>

55
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.523
<v Speaker 2>So sit back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a break from the sound bytes and </v>

56
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 2>distractions and open your minds to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues that matter.</v>

57
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Your brain will thank you and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>country will too.</v>

58
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.970
<v Speaker 2>We're continuing our monthly </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaboration with my friends with learn</v>

59
00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:24.804
<v Speaker 2>liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This week my guest is head of education </v>

60
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:27.324
<v Speaker 2>at the Institute for Economic Affairs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>London as well as a historian and </v>

61
00:03:30.841 --> 00:03:34.590
<v Speaker 2>lecturer and he flew all the way across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pond to be here.</v>

62
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Dr Steve Davies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the show.</v>

63
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Glad to be here.</v>

64
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.590
<v Speaker 2>I heard you got held up by President </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>

65
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.603
<v Speaker 2>so we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just got told that a vip was going </v>

66
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:47.430
<v Speaker 2>through the airport and so they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>just shut it down for half an hour.</v>

67
00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:48.264
<v Speaker 2>So we were held up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he must have been really </v>

68
00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.383
<v Speaker 2>After 11 and a half hour flight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even want to hear that it's </v>

70
00:03:53.521 --> 00:03:55.530
<v Speaker 2>the president or there's nobody really </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

71
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

72
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.993
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much that I want to do with </v>

73
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:01.890
<v Speaker 2>you and I watched a ton of your learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberty videos,</v>

74
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:02.724
<v Speaker 2>so I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty well versed in some of the </v>

75
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.310
<v Speaker 2>stuff that you're well versed in.</v>

76
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.640
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you want to come to America just one</v>

77
00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:10.770
<v Speaker 2>more time before our election?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

78
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:11.604
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something really strange going </v>

79
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 2>on here in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fair to say,</v>

80
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.253
<v Speaker 2>although maybe not that strange because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that what's happening </v>

81
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:19.824
<v Speaker 2>with Donald Trump is pulse for more </v>
<v Speaker 2>widespread phenomenon in most western </v>

82
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:26.610
<v Speaker 2>democracies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the rise of a kind of politics.</v>

83
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.453
<v Speaker 2>It's commonly described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think misleadingly as right wing </v>

84
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:30.954
<v Speaker 2>populism and what it actually is is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics that combines left of center </v>

85
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:35.694
<v Speaker 2>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong support for the welfare state </v>

86
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.003
<v Speaker 2>with an extremely unpleasant kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nativism and she globalism and </v>

87
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.963
<v Speaker 2>nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's pretty much where Donald </v>

88
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.513
<v Speaker 2>Trump is coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's straightforward Hamiltonian </v>

89
00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:46.674
<v Speaker 2>economic nationalism combined with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very unpleasant kind of identity </v>

90
00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:50.460
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

91
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.890
<v Speaker 2>but he's not alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's possibly much bigger phenomenon.</v>

92
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.843
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's unpack a couple of those </v>

93
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 2>phrases.</v>

94
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 2>So you'd say this isn't a right wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon because his politics are kind</v>

95
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:01.260
<v Speaker 2>of are kind of lame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

96
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that it's that,</v>

97
00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:06.870
<v Speaker 2>but he is using nationalism so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is more of the right side.</v>

98
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.853
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the other parts that were the </v>

99
00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 2>source of support for the welfare state </v>
<v Speaker 2>support for the strictly national basis,</v>

100
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:13.254
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the correct name for this kind of </v>

101
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:16.440
<v Speaker 2>politics I think is nationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>collectivism.</v>

102
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.043
<v Speaker 2>You could call it national socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the kinds of being claimed already </v>

103
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 2>that might be a little too scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too scary.</v>

104
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.520
<v Speaker 2>It's nationalist collectivism basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's on the rise across most Western</v>

105
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 2>democracies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Few exceptions like Spain,</v>

106
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.910
<v Speaker 2>Portugal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ireland,</v>

107
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.073
<v Speaker 2>but otherwise this is the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics that we see on the rise </v>

108
00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:33.714
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid Marine Le Pen in France get </v>

109
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:35.934
<v Speaker 2>builders in the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump here pretty much </v>

110
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:39.690
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada is another exception.</v>

111
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 2>So what is happening globally that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>caused that?</v>

112
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:43.824
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just a fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think everyone in America </v>

113
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 2>thinks everything is about us all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and this is just our phenomenon.</v>

114
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:50.580
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's happening?</v>

115
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two things.</v>

116
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:52.734
<v Speaker 2>I think one of them is that a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>support for this kind of politics comes </v>

117
00:05:55.501 --> 00:06:00.060
<v Speaker 2>from older working class voters in what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would call the rust belt,</v>

118
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.213
<v Speaker 2>a decade x industrial areas where life </v>
<v Speaker 2>has not been good for quite a long time </v>

119
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 2>and these people feel that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignored by the political establishment,</v>

120
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 2>that the system is not working in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests and that kicking back.</v>

121
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one reason.</v>

122
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 2>And some of that you think you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>argue is legit,</v>

123
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:16.351
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

124
00:06:16.351 --> 00:06:16.980
<v Speaker 2>It's legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're quite right.</v>

126
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.023
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life has been pretty hard for them for </v>

127
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:20.654
<v Speaker 2>quite a long time.</v>

128
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 2>The other thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I actually think is more important</v>

129
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 2>is it's to do with the politics of </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

130
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to do with a feeling that a certain</v>

131
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 2>kind of identity is under threat from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the process of globalization.</v>

132
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Cosmopolitanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe political correctness,</v>

133
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.783
<v Speaker 2>a whole bunch of stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a very powerful cultural </v>

134
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.293
<v Speaker 2>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reassertion of a certain kind of </v>

135
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.080
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

136
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.963
<v Speaker 2>and I think that is what is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>potent and really driving this kind of </v>

137
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:45.644
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how much of that is just a reaction </v>

138
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 2>to some of this stuff happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left?</v>

139
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come from the left,</v>

141
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:53.954
<v Speaker 2>so that's the part that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on and I do see a certain </v>

142
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:57.644
<v Speaker 2>element of the rise of trump and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political correctness stuff and you </v>

143
00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social justice warrior stuff.</v>

144
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.123
<v Speaker 2>I see it as a natural reaction to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>has happened on the left or maybe maybe </v>

145
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 2>in Europe.</v>

146
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's more because of immigration that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these marine Le Pen for example,</v>

147
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:13.304
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there is an element of </v>

148
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 2>truth in both of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

149
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Undoubtedly the push button issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

150
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 2>as we saw in the brexit referendum in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK for example,</v>

151
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with Marion Le Pen is immigration,</v>

152
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 2>particularly immigration from the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>East,</v>

153
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 2>but also from other parts of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

154
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 2>But that's in a way is not so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of immigration per se.</v>

155
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:31.304
<v Speaker 2>It's because the way in which large </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale movement into people is seemed to </v>

156
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:34.664
<v Speaker 2>be transforming and changing the nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a settled and established a national </v>

157
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.043
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I think that in terms of </v>

158
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.900
<v Speaker 2>particularly the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

159
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:43.710
<v Speaker 2>there is quite a lot of pushback </v>
<v Speaker 2>against,</v>

160
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.833
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of a social justice warrior as </v>

161
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:47.834
<v Speaker 2>you alluded to a pc politics on the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in particular the politics of </v>

162
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

163
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to push a politics of </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity where apparently the only group</v>

164
00:07:56.481 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 2>who aren't allowed to have an identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>are white working class men.</v>

165
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Sooner or later those kinds of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to say,</v>

166
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:04.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a minute.</v>

167
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.413
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this identity to which you are </v>

168
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:07.604
<v Speaker 2>not respecting your own terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of pushback coming on </v>

169
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 2>and I think that shows how really the </v>
<v Speaker 2>response that liberals need to have,</v>

170
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 2>and I would include many people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left in that category should be one way.</v>

171
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:17.834
<v Speaker 2>You were certainly importance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individualism and the identity as being </v>

172
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:24.770
<v Speaker 2>something that to a great degree is </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally chosen and formed rather than</v>

173
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 2>being something that's given to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fixed in some way.</v>

174
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love that and that's exactly </v>

175
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:31.850
<v Speaker 2>how my own evolution has happened over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last couple of years.</v>

176
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:32.684
<v Speaker 2>Coming out of progressivism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more about the collective to </v>

177
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:36.044
<v Speaker 2>ultimately realize I would only want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be judged by my own thoughts and my own </v>

178
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:40.514
<v Speaker 2>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's circle back a little bit to to </v>

179
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Europe and then we'll do our elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're getting some big stuff.</v>

180
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 2>So when it comes to the immigration </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation all over Europe,</v>

181
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.543
<v Speaker 2>I sense what you're saying is there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain natural reaction to people </v>

182
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>coming in and not assimilating properly </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever else.</v>

183
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>There may be the economic strains and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

184
00:08:59.070 --> 00:08:59.903
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the proper solution for all </v>

185
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:02.763
<v Speaker 1>these countries now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the cat's out of the bag </v>

186
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:03.910
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

187
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:04.743
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well actually a lot of the responses </v>

188
00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:08.870
<v Speaker 2>misguided in my view because for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

189
00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:09.704
<v Speaker 2>there was a widespread perception </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that immigration imposes costs </v>

190
00:09:12.891 --> 00:09:14.690
<v Speaker 2>on the countries that the immigrants go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

191
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.020
<v Speaker 2>All of the research I was actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not the case.</v>

192
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.883
<v Speaker 2>Immigrants are actually extremely good </v>
<v Speaker 2>news because typically they are younger </v>

193
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.680
<v Speaker 2>than the host population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are almost always in work.</v>

194
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.680
<v Speaker 2>They come to look for work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to do productive labor,</v>

195
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:28.603
<v Speaker 2>how can that be a problem you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so typically they are tax payers </v>

196
00:09:31.461 --> 00:09:32.294
<v Speaker 2>rather than tax consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They typically make a net contribution </v>

197
00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:35.234
<v Speaker 2>to the budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do not depress wages because </v>

198
00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:37.844
<v Speaker 2>typically they do work that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous population either can't or </v>

199
00:09:41.091 --> 00:09:43.100
<v Speaker 2>won't do usually because they lack the </v>
<v Speaker 2>skillset.</v>

200
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.293
<v Speaker 2>They do have a marginal depressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect on the wages of the bottom 10 </v>

201
00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:48.860
<v Speaker 2>percent of the income range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's about it,</v>

202
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.023
<v Speaker 2>but there's a widespread misconception </v>
<v Speaker 2>or misunderstanding of what the </v>

203
00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:53.684
<v Speaker 2>economics of immigration is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance and that's a failure of public </v>

204
00:09:56.511 --> 00:09:57.500
<v Speaker 2>education really.</v>

205
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.633
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the more profound thing though </v>

206
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.203
<v Speaker 2>is a feeling that there's a threat to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>established indigenous culture and I </v>

207
00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:08.580
<v Speaker 2>think the response here is to simply be </v>
<v Speaker 2>more confident.</v>

208
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:09.763
<v Speaker 2>I have enormous confidence in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Assembler to power of the culture of a </v>

209
00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:16.250
<v Speaker 2>free society and I think the thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not to say,</v>

210
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.113
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here are people who are asserting a </v>

211
00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:23.051
<v Speaker 2>particular collective cultural identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we need to do is assert our own one</v>

212
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.210
<v Speaker 2>in response to that and aggressively </v>
<v Speaker 2>against that verse one,</v>

213
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.343
<v Speaker 2>the thing to do is to emphasize </v>
<v Speaker 2>individualism and the degree to which </v>

214
00:10:29.751 --> 00:10:34.430
<v Speaker 2>are modern free society is one where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are free to form that shape their</v>

215
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.293
<v Speaker 2>own identity through the choices that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they make and that should be true for </v>

216
00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:38.210
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

217
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a way you're.</v>

218
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.003
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at it in sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>macro sense of are we should deal with </v>

219
00:10:42.891 --> 00:10:45.100
<v Speaker 1>all this a certain amount of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ground,</v>

220
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 1>they just don't see it that way because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they see where you are.</v>

221
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:51.860
<v Speaker 1>These people coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the job thing is incorrect,</v>

222
00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:53.360
<v Speaker 1>they feel that their jobs are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken.</v>

223
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.640
<v Speaker 1>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I read stories about things like in</v>

224
00:10:55.641 --> 00:10:56.474
<v Speaker 1>Germany that I saw something that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to cost one point 4 billion euros </v>

225
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.500
<v Speaker 1>to give the refugees or the migrants </v>
<v Speaker 1>dental care,</v>

226
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean these things are just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically</v>

227
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.240
<v Speaker 2>that isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the areas where there are</v>

228
00:11:10.241 --> 00:11:13.690
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are all areas where it's the state</v>

229
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.583
<v Speaker 2>that is in boulder as a major provider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not see grocery stores panicking </v>

230
00:11:18.221 --> 00:11:19.054
<v Speaker 2>because they suddenly have to find food </v>
<v Speaker 2>products and other products for new </v>

231
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.433
<v Speaker 2>customers on the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look at it as a business </v>

232
00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:25.834
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The private sector everywhere actually </v>

233
00:11:27.701 --> 00:11:29.800
<v Speaker 2>sees large scale movement of people as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

234
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.120
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an opportunity.</v>

235
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.013
<v Speaker 2>Not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the areas where the state is </v>

236
00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:34.564
<v Speaker 2>involved that you find problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that shows us is actually the </v>

237
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:38.803
<v Speaker 2>incompetence inefficiency of modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments as compared to the private </v>

238
00:11:41.381 --> 00:11:42.214
<v Speaker 2>sector.</v>

239
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.103
<v Speaker 1>So even if we viewed everyone as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the individual that we're going to </v>

240
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 1>talk a lot about the individual here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

241
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.153
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's possibly something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different with this wave of immigration </v>

242
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.513
<v Speaker 1>related to terrorism and we know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of people that </v>

243
00:11:57.821 --> 00:11:58.654
<v Speaker 1>isis wants to infiltrate and cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>borders that there is something </v>

244
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:02.224
<v Speaker 1>different about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even if all of us in the west </v>

245
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:05.824
<v Speaker 1>say it's about individualism and let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>judge people individually and by their </v>

246
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>actions and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a certain amount of people don't want</v>

247
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 1>to assimilate what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do then?</v>

248
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in in in one sense,</v>

249
00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:19.124
<v Speaker 2>not assimilating is not in and of itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>a problem where I live in Manchester </v>

250
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.320
<v Speaker 2>then so well established Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

251
00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:26.740
<v Speaker 2>been there since the 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties and nineties.</v>

252
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.480
<v Speaker 2>These people are Hacidic Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strict,</v>

253
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.343
<v Speaker 2>ultra orthodox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are lubavitch has </v>

254
00:12:31.491 --> 00:12:32.324
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not assimilated in some </v>

255
00:12:34.011 --> 00:12:35.510
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally never watched television,</v>

256
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:37.250
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against their beliefs and sold,</v>

257
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.890
<v Speaker 2>but nobody I think would regard that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a problem.</v>

258
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.993
<v Speaker 2>From my point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just means I've got a wonderful </v>

259
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.990
<v Speaker 2>bakery in May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was fantastic bagels,</v>

260
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>

261
00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:49.550
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Association of a certain category of</v>

262
00:12:49.551 --> 00:12:51.620
<v Speaker 2>migrants from the Middle East with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic terrorism.</v>

263
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Now what's the best way to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

264
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.880
<v Speaker 2>That is a difficult issue on my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>

265
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.540
<v Speaker 2>very much is that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate solution is to try and sort</v>

266
00:12:59.541 --> 00:13:02.700
<v Speaker 2>out the complete mess at the Middle East</v>
<v Speaker 2>has become a,</v>

267
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.240
<v Speaker 2>but in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially this is a policing problem.</v>

268
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.163
<v Speaker 2>What you definitely don't want to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about is dealing with this as a problem </v>

269
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.540
<v Speaker 2>of military security is essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 2>law enforcement problem.</v>

270
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:12.523
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as someone that doesn't love state </v>

271
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.523
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it make you nervous that you have </v>

272
00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:19.004
<v Speaker 1>to sort of give a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>state power to the police or to the </v>

273
00:13:21.261 --> 00:13:22.094
<v Speaker 1>border controls or whatever to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that they're doing the right </v>

274
00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:24.590
<v Speaker 1>job?</v>

275
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am nervous about that.</v>

276
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.463
<v Speaker 2>And what I would say by the way is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of increase in state </v>

277
00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:33.320
<v Speaker 2>surveillance which has been put through </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United Kingdom,</v>

278
00:13:33.321 --> 00:13:34.154
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by our current prime minister when she </v>

279
00:13:35.121 --> 00:13:35.954
<v Speaker 2>was in a previous job as home secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually counterproductive in that </v>

280
00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:42.020
<v Speaker 2>regard because basically if you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the trust of the security services</v>

281
00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:42.854
<v Speaker 2>of golf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for the proverbial </v>

282
00:13:43.881 --> 00:13:46.520
<v Speaker 2>needle in a haystack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if that's the case,</v>

283
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.520
<v Speaker 2>why do you then make the haystack even </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger?</v>

284
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.850
<v Speaker 2>By intercepting virtually everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>email.</v>

285
00:13:52.851 --> 00:13:54.950
<v Speaker 2>That actually makes our job more </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult,</v>

286
00:13:54.951 --> 00:13:58.950
<v Speaker 2>not easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that actually what really</v>

287
00:13:58.951 --> 00:14:02.180
<v Speaker 2>you need is good old fashioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>undercover intelligence work,</v>

288
00:14:02.181 --> 00:14:05.530
<v Speaker 2>which means penetrating organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Identifying key people,</v>

289
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.500
<v Speaker 2>you basically try and keep an eye on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>good old fashioned spy work really.</v>

290
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.420
<v Speaker 2>It's always going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the way to do it.</v>

291
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because you're making a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real argument for limited government and</v>

292
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:16.714
<v Speaker 1>the slim trim government through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a prism that a lot of people </v>

293
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:21.604
<v Speaker 1>don't think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think we need big government to </v>

294
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:24.004
<v Speaker 1>protect us from things and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have surveillance and all of these </v>

295
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>things that people that are for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're really making an argument for</v>

296
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:33.410
<v Speaker 1>if you actually took a lot of that away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a more efficient way of killing</v>

297
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.253
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be much more effective in my </v>

298
00:14:34.721 --> 00:14:35.554
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

299
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.560
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

300
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about brexit a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I did a little bit of it on this</v>

301
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:41.890
<v Speaker 1>show and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:42.724
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly talking about how our </v>
<v Speaker 1>American media doesn't give us much of </v>

303
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't hear about it at all.</v>

304
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Then two days before everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out about it.</v>

305
00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>We saw it on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it happened that we don't talk</v>

306
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.873
<v Speaker 2>about it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

307
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 2>So for people that have no idea what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

308
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:57.670
<v Speaker 2>can you just give me a little history of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and then,</v>

309
00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.160
<v Speaker 2>and then where we're at now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain's relationship with the European</v>

310
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Union has always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

311
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.733
<v Speaker 2>a bit fraught and difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been like one of those unhappy </v>

312
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 2>marriages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

313
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 2>were outside just wonder why all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>two people together.</v>

314
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.733
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason being that British </v>

315
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:13.394
<v Speaker 2>politicians on the British public ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>since we first joined the European </v>

316
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:17.623
<v Speaker 2>Economic Community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sees that then was in 1973 have always </v>

317
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:20.114
<v Speaker 2>seen as being basically about economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about getting economic </v>

318
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:23.354
<v Speaker 2>advantage on the constant after they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>been equally clan right since the </v>

319
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.233
<v Speaker 2>Messina conference in 1954.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is all about building a </v>

320
00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:31.274
<v Speaker 2>political union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they see it as part of the kind of </v>

321
00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:36.770
<v Speaker 2>grand political project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the British politicians always say,</v>

322
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.633
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really mean that these </v>

323
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:39.374
<v Speaker 2>continentals this is just rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course is actually quite </v>

324
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:42.010
<v Speaker 2>offensive.</v>

325
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:42.843
<v Speaker 2>And not surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the continentals get a bit irritated by </v>

326
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:45.524
<v Speaker 2>this attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So essentially there's a growing </v>

327
00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 2>mismatch between what the British public</v>
<v Speaker 2>think the EU should be.</v>

328
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 2>And the actual nature of that project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's got significantly worse since</v>

329
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:55.214
<v Speaker 2>the Maastricht treaty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it caused all kinds of internal </v>

330
00:15:57.261 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Speaker 2>political reactions and David Cameron in</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I have to say.</v>

331
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:01.754
<v Speaker 2>It was a grotesque act of misjudgment </v>
<v Speaker 2>from his own perspective called a </v>

332
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.520
<v Speaker 2>referendum to try and sort out his </v>
<v Speaker 2>internal politics.</v>

333
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.653
<v Speaker 2>And now in that referendum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone thought the expectation was </v>

334
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 2>that the status quo would win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must say I expected that.</v>

335
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:16.310
<v Speaker 2>So that's basically why he called it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was empowering,</v>

336
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 2>figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call it,</v>

337
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.570
<v Speaker 2>they'll agree with me and that'll sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>out my party problem.</v>

338
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.513
<v Speaker 2>That's because generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>referenda normally go for the status </v>

339
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:26.270
<v Speaker 2>quo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in this case,</v>

340
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.730
<v Speaker 2>the overwhelming majority of members of </v>
<v Speaker 2>parliament,</v>

341
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 2>most of the respected pundits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most economists,</v>

342
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.160
<v Speaker 2>virtually all of the big business firms </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were asked the Bank of England,</v>

343
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:39.440
<v Speaker 2>pretty much any authority figure you </v>
<v Speaker 2>care to mention said,</v>

344
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:40.790
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to vote remain.</v>

345
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.923
<v Speaker 2>So what took place was a popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurgency and in which the ordinary </v>

346
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 2>British public thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

347
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.300
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't agree with this.</v>

348
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.373
<v Speaker 2>And they basically went against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>advice of the bulk of the political </v>

349
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:52.543
<v Speaker 2>media business leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the vote that came together to a </v>

350
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.920
<v Speaker 2>vote leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

351
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.340
<v Speaker 2>was basically a coalition of three quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinct groups.</v>

352
00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I think on the one hand you had what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might call Brexit Shyer.</v>

353
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 2>A older conservative voters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>typically a middleclass,</v>

354
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:11.570
<v Speaker 2>slightly older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in the countryside,</v>

355
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:14.300
<v Speaker 2>living in the affluent suburbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one block.</v>

356
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.060
<v Speaker 2>So that's a little bit of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you described voting for trump.</v>

357
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:20.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly more moderate.</v>

358
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.350
<v Speaker 2>The second group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

359
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Arlette people who voted for trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is older white working class voters</v>

360
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Speaker 2>in the traditional labour heartlands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the northeast of England,</v>

361
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.170
<v Speaker 2>the Midlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yorkshire,</v>

362
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.303
<v Speaker 2>the voting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some constituencies that like </v>

363
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.063
<v Speaker 2>Sunderland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is our current of say scratch and </v>

364
00:17:34.671 --> 00:17:35.504
<v Speaker 2>Wilkes Barre.</v>

365
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.660
<v Speaker 2>That was a 69 percent vote for leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an absolute landslide.</v>

366
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.050
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was that block of what you might call</v>

367
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.200
<v Speaker 2>a populist voters working class that put</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave over.</v>

368
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 2>The third very small group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I belong to,</v>

369
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.790
<v Speaker 2>is what you might call radical classical</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals who are very small group.</v>

370
00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:57.624
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say we made the difference in </v>

371
00:17:58.561 --> 00:17:59.394
<v Speaker 2>some ways because what we wanted to us </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to have a greater range of </v>

372
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:05.960
<v Speaker 2>options for the British government by </v>
<v Speaker 2>being outside of the year,</v>

373
00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:06.794
<v Speaker 2>use controls and constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's those three blocks of people </v>

374
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 2>that voted for leave basically.</v>

375
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like radical classical liberals </v>

376
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:14.910
<v Speaker 1>because I've been saying classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals.</v>

377
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:15.744
<v Speaker 1>It sounds too to benign or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radical has a little something extra </v>

378
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:19.890
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

379
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it was happening and you,</v>

380
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 1>you say you were part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

381
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.200
<v Speaker 1>did you expect the vote to go that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as you're saying,</v>

382
00:18:28.201 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Speaker 1>the entire establishment was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

383
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:31.434
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The polls were showing it wasn't going </v>

384
00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:33.000
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

385
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.833
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought it was going to be </v>

386
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.214
<v Speaker 2>tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my own expectation was that it was </v>

387
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:37.344
<v Speaker 2>going to be about 51 percent remained to</v>
<v Speaker 2>49 percent leave because normally in </v>

388
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:44.154
<v Speaker 2>referenda like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the undecided voters who make up their </v>

389
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:48.630
<v Speaker 2>mind at the last minute split to two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one for the status quo.</v>

390
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think they did here.</v>

391
00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:51.804
<v Speaker 2>But what happened was that the polls d </v>
<v Speaker 2>underestimated the leaves share of the </v>

392
00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:59.460
<v Speaker 2>vote by about five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason being a lot of the people who</v>

393
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:02.040
<v Speaker 2>voted leave are people who did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>normally vote,</v>

394
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.360
<v Speaker 2>and pollsters always discount people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>say that they don't vote,</v>

395
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.660
<v Speaker 2>so they got their sampling wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they underestimated the,</v>

396
00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:10.494
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the share of the vote that leaves going </v>

397
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:11.980
<v Speaker 2>to get.</v>

398
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.610
<v Speaker 1>So looping this back to trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I see such parallels here,</v>

399
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I suspect the exact same thing is gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

400
00:19:18.431 --> 00:19:19.264
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying trump's going gonna win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do suspect there a depression in </v>

401
00:19:21.971 --> 00:19:22.804
<v Speaker 1>the polls because a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his supporters now either aren't being </v>

402
00:19:26.261 --> 00:19:27.094
<v Speaker 1>pulled for whatever they're in places </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not polling or they don't </v>

403
00:19:29.291 --> 00:19:30.970
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be publicly shamed or</v>

404
00:19:30.971 --> 00:19:33.610
<v Speaker 1>admitted or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sent that.</v>

405
00:19:33.611 --> 00:19:37.240
<v Speaker 1>What you're talking about here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this groundswell of support that was not</v>

406
00:19:37.241 --> 00:19:38.580
<v Speaker 1>spoken of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

407
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's fair?</v>

408
00:19:40.601 --> 00:19:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

409
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.573
<v Speaker 2>Do think so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's two things going on </v>

410
00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:43.914
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is what century here in Los Angeles </v>

411
00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:46.254
<v Speaker 2>needs is known as the Tom Bradley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people are not honest in the answers </v>

412
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:50.680
<v Speaker 2>that gives the pollsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

413
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.533
<v Speaker 2>but also I think that actually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pollsters samples are probably slightly </v>

414
00:19:53.641 --> 00:19:55.110
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably a,</v>

415
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.033
<v Speaker 2>not counting the correct number of trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>voters because one of the things he did </v>

416
00:19:58.651 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 2>during the primaries was to bring a </v>
<v Speaker 2>record number of people into the primary</v>

417
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.370
<v Speaker 2>process who had never voted before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

418
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:06.204
<v Speaker 2>what I suspect that means is he's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be much more competitive than it </v>

419
00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 2>currently appears to be in states like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ohio,</v>

420
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

421
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.793
<v Speaker 2>maybe even Michigan and Arizona where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think there's a significant number of </v>

422
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:20.160
<v Speaker 2>people who have not voted before who </v>
<v Speaker 2>will vote.</v>

423
00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of when you see Nigel </v>

424
00:20:22.121 --> 00:20:24.700
<v Speaker 1>farrage come here and speak at trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>rallies?</v>

425
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:25.803
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of the connection </v>

426
00:20:26.501 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Speaker 1>between the two of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

427
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.040
<v Speaker 1>and is this really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

428
00:20:30.041 --> 00:20:34.070
<v Speaker 1>if when I click on info wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a link or some of the other things,</v>

429
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.260
<v Speaker 1>the more right things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breitbart,</v>

430
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.900
<v Speaker 1>that really they're fighting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>globalists,</v>

431
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:38.763
<v Speaker 1>the globalists are coming here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some degree to a one </v>

432
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.950
<v Speaker 1>world government thing that's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate,</v>

433
00:20:44.951 --> 00:20:47.410
<v Speaker 1>but like how much it feels so </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiratorial.</v>

434
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

435
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.190
<v Speaker 2>I that that's exactly the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>alignment that I was talking about these</v>

436
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Nigel farage and Ukip in the UK,</v>

437
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.513
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that part of the nationalist reaction </v>

438
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.273
<v Speaker 2>against the increased cosmopolitanism </v>
<v Speaker 2>globalization that we've seen in the </v>

439
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:02.470
<v Speaker 2>last 20 to 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

440
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.343
<v Speaker 2>there's a feeling that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>transnational organizations that are </v>

441
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:05.794
<v Speaker 2>pushing an agenda they don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically it's more a kind of </v>

442
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 2>localism or hostility to cosmopolitanism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to globalism.</v>

443
00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:13.300
<v Speaker 2>And you see that on both sides of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlantic.</v>

444
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a politics I strongly reject.</v>

445
00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:17.800
<v Speaker 2>But you can't deny the reality of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence of it.</v>

446
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what makes it so hard to talk</v>

447
00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:22.000
<v Speaker 2>about because it's not fun to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something you reject,</v>

448
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:23.440
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>

449
00:21:23.441 --> 00:21:26.500
<v Speaker 2>to be a classical liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to acknowledge that something's</v>

450
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.040
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is it's no point in ignoring this.</v>

451
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if you disagree with something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a belief that a lot of people have,</v>

452
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.293
<v Speaker 2>the thing to do is to engage with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have to do is to actually talk </v>

453
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:37.660
<v Speaker 2>to these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect their views,</v>

454
00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:41.110
<v Speaker 2>but show them that you think they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistaken and here's why that mistake.</v>

455
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

456
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:43.890
<v Speaker 2>so now brexit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

457
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Everyone said the next day the markets </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to crash,</v>

458
00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:48.470
<v Speaker 2>the economy is going to crash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything will be over.</v>

459
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.970
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be fighting for bread or </v>
<v Speaker 2>have you had red light?</v>

460
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:51.923
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

461
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.420
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>

462
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I think we're still the funding goal </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage right now.</v>

463
00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:57.993
<v Speaker 2>I think this going to be an enormous and</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite serious political route with the </v>

464
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.560
<v Speaker 2>United Kingdom the next few months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big question that was,</v>

465
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:03.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>

466
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 2>And there are really two routes that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>British government can take quite simply</v>

467
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.133
<v Speaker 2>to simplify it.</v>

468
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.410
<v Speaker 2>One is they can go for what's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>membership of what's called the European</v>

469
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.273
<v Speaker 2>economic area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that we would be a bit like </v>

470
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

471
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 2>That means we would have access to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>European single market regime,</v>

472
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.253
<v Speaker 2>but we will still be bound by lots of EU</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations while no longer having any </v>

473
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:25.450
<v Speaker 2>say in how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were or how they were formed.</v>

474
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:26.284
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorta like,</v>

475
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of like staying in the EU </v>
<v Speaker 2>but light.</v>

476
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

477
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.150
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

478
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>

479
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 2>the other alternative is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

480
00:22:34.601 --> 00:22:35.434
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We basically wanted negotiate a free </v>

481
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:38.644
<v Speaker 2>trade deal with the Aau.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trouble is that wants to resume my </v>

482
00:22:40.701 --> 00:22:41.534
<v Speaker 2>triggers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called article 50 of the Lisbon </v>

483
00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Treaty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the withdrawal process.</v>

484
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:45.663
<v Speaker 2>It's got a strict two year limit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear that you can negotiate a </v>

485
00:22:47.891 --> 00:22:50.410
<v Speaker 2>two year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a free trade deal in just two years.</v>

486
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.573
<v Speaker 2>So that would throw us back a pot just </v>
<v Speaker 2>membership of the World Trade </v>

487
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.343
<v Speaker 2>Organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that will then be a six and </v>

488
00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:59.110
<v Speaker 2>a half percent tarriff between Britain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Europe.</v>

489
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.183
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably more than compensated </v>

490
00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:04.690
<v Speaker 2>for by the decline in the value of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pound that's taken place,</v>

491
00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's still not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not very welcome.</v>

492
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Now the the critical political thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the city of London,</v>

493
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.100
<v Speaker 2>a seven percent of British GDP would </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose its passporting rights.</v>

494
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.180
<v Speaker 2>It would not be able to do euro </v>
<v Speaker 2>denominated business unless we're in the</v>

495
00:23:19.181 --> 00:23:20.014
<v Speaker 2>European economic area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem politically for Theresa May </v>

496
00:23:23.441 --> 00:23:27.430
<v Speaker 2>and the government is that the Europeans</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been very reasonably in what you're</v>

497
00:23:27.431 --> 00:23:28.264
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

498
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.193
<v Speaker 2>if you become member of the EA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to accept free movement of </v>

499
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the deal.</v>

500
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 2>You don't cherry pick your conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems perfectly reasonable to me,</v>

501
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.710
<v Speaker 2>and the problem is that for political </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>

502
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:39.544
<v Speaker 2>because so many of the people who voted </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave did so on anti immigration </v>

503
00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:43.870
<v Speaker 2>grounds.</v>

504
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.450
<v Speaker 2>She is not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a significant portion of them.</v>

505
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Sure she's not prepared to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the result is that they have,</v>

506
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:50.543
<v Speaker 2>it looks like we're going to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>not applied to join the eea effectively </v>

507
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 2>and that's going to cause enormous </v>
<v Speaker 2>political ructions.</v>

508
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.343
<v Speaker 2>Now in the longer term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the British economy will do </v>

509
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:01.070
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There may be some,</v>

510
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.470
<v Speaker 2>some will be some losers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the city of London.</v>

511
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.410
<v Speaker 2>There'll be some gangers though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a manufacturers in particular,</v>

512
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.330
<v Speaker 2>an export as consumers because the price</v>
<v Speaker 2>of goods like food will go down,</v>

513
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 2>it'll even out it's a bit of a wash </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready,</v>

514
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:15.800
<v Speaker 2>but in the short term is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a lot of political fireworks,</v>

515
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.963
<v Speaker 2>so all that being said aren't those </v>
<v Speaker 2>subtle reasons that brexit was actually </v>

516
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:21.494
<v Speaker 2>the right decision because you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>still have to sort of negotiate things </v>

517
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:31.150
<v Speaker 2>with the EU in a weird way that allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to have power over you and that was</v>

518
00:24:31.461 --> 00:24:32.820
<v Speaker 2>what the whole purpose of leading way.</v>

519
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:33.913
<v Speaker 2>So in a way it's like better to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>now than 10 years when a lot of this </v>

520
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:39.360
<v Speaker 2>stuff has even been tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

521
00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the point is what brexit does,</v>

522
00:24:41.451 --> 00:24:43.400
<v Speaker 2>and this was my main reason for voting </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

523
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't passionate lever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did vote leave the end.</v>

524
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.903
<v Speaker 2>The main reasons for doing it is that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>increases the range of political </v>

525
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:49.754
<v Speaker 2>possibilities open to the British </v>
<v Speaker 2>electorate and the British government </v>

526
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.243
<v Speaker 2>for both good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now they're highly constrained </v>

527
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.753
<v Speaker 2>because a whole lot of radical policies </v>
<v Speaker 2>on both left and right would fall foul </v>

528
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.043
<v Speaker 2>of the EU zone rules and regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's actually a very narrow range </v>

529
00:25:02.871 --> 00:25:03.704
<v Speaker 2>of what is allowable politically now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have left the a year or once </v>

530
00:25:07.671 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 2>we've left a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes much wider.</v>

531
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Whole range of options are opened up </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

532
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.790
<v Speaker 2>The job for me then is to argue for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right wants to be really bad ones.</v>

533
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

534
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.760
<v Speaker 2>your job just started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

535
00:25:19.761 --> 00:25:20.594
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

536
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:21.463
<v Speaker 2>so that's my main reason for doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there are much greater </v>

537
00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:25.120
<v Speaker 2>options open to us now in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

538
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you sense that the EU as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a entity is really in trouble?</v>

539
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:30.314
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything beyond what just happened </v>

540
00:25:31.431 --> 00:25:32.840
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you guys.</v>

541
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've got grease basically in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hostage situation,</v>

542
00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:37.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean is that,</v>

543
00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:39.120
<v Speaker 2>am I being too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

544
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Greeks would agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

545
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:42.283
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you think the future here is </v>

546
00:25:43.671 --> 00:25:44.504
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

547
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain leaving,</v>

548
00:25:46.371 --> 00:25:48.500
<v Speaker 2>you've got grease in a hostage </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

549
00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:49.334
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately the borders that are </v>

550
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 2>crumbling people aren't happy with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

551
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:56.690
<v Speaker 2>the real problem that the EU faces is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the incredible act of Hubris they did at</v>

552
00:25:56.691 --> 00:25:57.524
<v Speaker 2>the master treaty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to create a single currency </v>

553
00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.650
<v Speaker 2>when they don't have a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

554
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>

555
00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.210
<v Speaker 2>pretty much every economist on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet at the time,</v>

556
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.240
<v Speaker 2>regardless of their politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that this was a really bad idea and</v>

557
00:26:10.431 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 2>they all thought it was a bad idea for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same reason,</v>

558
00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.453
<v Speaker 2>which is that there's no historical case</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever have a single currency area that </v>

559
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a single government </v>
<v Speaker 2>surviving,</v>

560
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.293
<v Speaker 2>and if you do have a single currency </v>
<v Speaker 2>area in countries that are not </v>

561
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 2>economically aligned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

562
00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:29.750
<v Speaker 2>and you don't have a single government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of really bad stuff happens.</v>

563
00:26:29.751 --> 00:26:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Paul trible and Milton Friedman in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same way,</v>

564
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.043
<v Speaker 2>made almost exactly the same point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they ignore the advice from all the </v>

565
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:40.100
<v Speaker 2>economists as portraying when rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>which Lee put it.</v>

566
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.680
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The good news is we know now the optimal</v>

567
00:26:42.681 --> 00:26:44.760
<v Speaker 2>currency area theory is completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

568
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.773
<v Speaker 2>The bad news is we've had to bugger up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy of a continent to figure it </v>

569
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:49.870
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure it out,</v>

570
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.470
<v Speaker 2>approve it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the point is they.</v>

571
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.830
<v Speaker 2>They still haven't resolved that </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

572
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greece is a small country.</v>

573
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.970
<v Speaker 2>They can handle Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if Italy goes under,</v>

574
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 2>which is quite likely the Italian </v>
<v Speaker 2>banking system is in really,</v>

575
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:01.224
<v Speaker 2>really bad shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's a major crisis in Italy or </v>

576
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:06.330
<v Speaker 2>maybe in France or some other larger </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

577
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.373
<v Speaker 2>they won't be able to resolve it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to have to either </v>

578
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:09.774
<v Speaker 2>create something like a government for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the euro zone or they're going to have </v>

579
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 2>to allow the euro to be dismantled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>either of those as a huge event.</v>

580
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:16.763
<v Speaker 2>Plus there's an election next spring in </v>
<v Speaker 2>France and there's a pretty reasonable </v>

581
00:27:21.361 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Speaker 2>chance that marine Le Pen will win the </v>
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>

582
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.570
<v Speaker 2>If she's up against one candidate from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>center,</v>

583
00:27:27.571 --> 00:27:28.404
<v Speaker 2>right Alan page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she will lose if she's up against the </v>

584
00:27:30.571 --> 00:27:32.060
<v Speaker 2>former president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarkozy,</v>

585
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.390
<v Speaker 2>the polls show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

586
00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:36.150
<v Speaker 2>very close and I would actually take her</v>
<v Speaker 2>to beat him,</v>

587
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:36.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

588
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:37.403
<v Speaker 2>Because that could be one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations where the Poles are going to </v>

589
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.233
<v Speaker 2>hate her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus also these polls now before </v>

590
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.940
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a very effective campaigner and so</v>

591
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.900
<v Speaker 2>I think she could beat their rival </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate if it's Sarkozy.</v>

592
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.033
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she became president mean the odds </v>

593
00:27:51.271 --> 00:27:52.980
<v Speaker 2>are still against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if she did,</v>

594
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.670
<v Speaker 2>she said she'd immediately call a </v>
<v Speaker 2>referendum on France leaving the EU.</v>

595
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.893
<v Speaker 2>Now all the Poles there indicates 65 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the French public would vote </v>

596
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:03.030
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if that happens,</v>

597
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.780
<v Speaker 2>the Aau is finished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

598
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 2>It's done full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's in really bad.</v>

599
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 2>It's an a very tricky situation right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

600
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 2>The EU.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for someone like yourself,</v>

601
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberal,</v>

602
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.700
<v Speaker 2>and you want this to be about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

603
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.630
<v Speaker 2>So I can understand the separation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you think ultimately this is good.</v>

604
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:23.010
<v Speaker 2>It seems like in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you then have to align yourself with the</v>

605
00:28:23.011 --> 00:28:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Marie Le Pen's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

606
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

607
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.633
<v Speaker 2>you end up by default falling into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>category with the people that want to </v>

608
00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Speaker 2>leave the event with the nationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

609
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.840
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't sense that you have.</v>

610
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.300
<v Speaker 2>So how does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you negotiate that with yourself,</v>

611
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.640
<v Speaker 2>with great difficulty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the big problem.</v>

612
00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:42.990
<v Speaker 2>The problem for many classical liberals </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UK was if we vote leave,</v>

613
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:43.853
<v Speaker 2>will this not give a big boost to </v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely the kind of politics that you </v>

614
00:28:45.931 --> 00:28:48.270
<v Speaker 2>most dislike?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the argument desert.</v>

615
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.020
<v Speaker 2>My colleagues for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

616
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

617
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 2>basically you have to realize if things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this happen,</v>

618
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.513
<v Speaker 2>you are going to be alongside a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that otherwise you totally </v>

619
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:01.950
<v Speaker 2>detest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you then have to do is to argue</v>

620
00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:03.630
<v Speaker 2>the case very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strongly against them.</v>

621
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Now the crucial thing here I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>for liberals both left and right of you,</v>

622
00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:11.940
<v Speaker 2>well classical liberals and social </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals to come together and to realize</v>

623
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.030
<v Speaker 2>that they have a common photos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

624
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.800
<v Speaker 2>in the shape of the national </v>
<v Speaker 2>collectivists.</v>

625
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.980
<v Speaker 2>And on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the radical radical left.</v>

626
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.500
<v Speaker 2>And so here in the United States for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

627
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I think it's quite likely that there may</v>
<v Speaker 2>well be a kind of a proximal in the next</v>

628
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.070
<v Speaker 2>few years between the kind of moderate </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the Republican Party.</v>

629
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:29.904
<v Speaker 2>So called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually many ways the more </v>

630
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:32.790
<v Speaker 2>libertarian part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiscally conservative,</v>

631
00:29:32.791 --> 00:29:35.130
<v Speaker 2>but socially liberal you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on the other hand,</v>

632
00:29:35.131 --> 00:29:37.090
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream of the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

633
00:29:37.091 --> 00:29:37.924
<v Speaker 2>and this will be aimed at both the kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who are now voting for trump </v>

634
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.040
<v Speaker 2>and also the kind of people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting Bernie Sanders earlier on.</v>

635
00:29:44.041 --> 00:29:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

636
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.023
<v Speaker 1>The primary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know this is this political </v>

637
00:29:46.291 --> 00:29:48.450
<v Speaker 1>realignment is one of the things you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about lately.</v>

638
00:29:48.451 --> 00:29:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And I love that because that's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've been trying to talk about,</v>

639
00:29:51.631 --> 00:29:54.210
<v Speaker 1>that I no longer as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a classical liberal,</v>

640
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.283
<v Speaker 1>I don't really see conservatives as my </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy as maybe five years ago I might </v>

641
00:29:58.681 --> 00:30:00.690
<v Speaker 1>have thought that they would be where </v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's like,</v>

642
00:30:00.691 --> 00:30:01.524
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can have some disagreements about </v>

643
00:30:02.641 --> 00:30:07.340
<v Speaker 1>taxes and maybe we're not in the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>place related to abortion or a series of</v>

644
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:08.223
<v Speaker 1>states rights or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there has to be a new center </v>

645
00:30:11.401 --> 00:30:12.234
<v Speaker 1>developing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise a lot of classical liberals </v>

646
00:30:14.461 --> 00:30:16.510
<v Speaker 1>will end up going this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

647
00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:18.840
<v Speaker 1>the Libertarians will end up going </v>
<v Speaker 1>further to the right.</v>

648
00:30:18.841 --> 00:30:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Classical liberals may go further left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that's not good for.</v>

649
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

650
00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.750
<v Speaker 2>well indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way to think of is this,</v>

651
00:30:23.751 --> 00:30:24.584
<v Speaker 2>I think since about the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big argument in politics on both </v>

652
00:30:27.741 --> 00:30:29.870
<v Speaker 2>sides of the Atlantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but particularly here in the US has been</v>

653
00:30:29.871 --> 00:30:30.704
<v Speaker 2>between one group of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>economically interventionists in the </v>

654
00:30:33.281 --> 00:30:34.114
<v Speaker 2>gala Cesarean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but socially liberal versus another </v>

655
00:30:36.321 --> 00:30:37.154
<v Speaker 2>group who appropriate market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but socially and culturally </v>

656
00:30:38.781 --> 00:30:40.670
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's been the big division.</v>

657
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.510
<v Speaker 2>What I think we're now moving towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a situation where they divide is</v>

658
00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:47.960
<v Speaker 2>between one group of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadly free market,</v>

659
00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.510
<v Speaker 2>broadly individualists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>globalist,</v>

660
00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.850
<v Speaker 2>perhaps a bit more egalitarian than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberals would like,</v>

661
00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:56.790
<v Speaker 2>but broadly liberal versus another group</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the national collective.</v>

662
00:30:56.791 --> 00:30:59.690
<v Speaker 2>It's I mentioned earlier who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually economically interventionists,</v>

663
00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:03.200
<v Speaker 2>pro welfare state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but very culturally conservative,</v>

664
00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.480
<v Speaker 2>quite authoritarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti globalist,</v>

665
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:06.573
<v Speaker 2>a anti cosmopolitan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the new division I think </v>

666
00:31:09.351 --> 00:31:12.560
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing in politics everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that all a lot of the</v>

667
00:31:12.561 --> 00:31:14.420
<v Speaker 2>existing subgroups are going to split </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

668
00:31:14.421 --> 00:31:16.370
<v Speaker 2>so conservatives are going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide,</v>

669
00:31:16.371 --> 00:31:17.060
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

670
00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:17.960
<v Speaker 2>what is more important to you?</v>

671
00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.793
<v Speaker 2>The cultural conservatism and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalism or the free markets and the </v>

672
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.730
<v Speaker 2>individualism and if you're on the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to decide,</v>

673
00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.191
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

674
00:31:25.191 --> 00:31:26.024
<v Speaker 2>what am I really more interested in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're one of the kind of </v>

675
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.760
<v Speaker 2>identity Marion anti globalist left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually may find yourself thinking,</v>

676
00:31:31.761 --> 00:31:34.850
<v Speaker 2>well actually right now I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've probably got more in common in some</v>

677
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:38.660
<v Speaker 2>ways with this kind of new emerging </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamiltonian nationalist politics.</v>

678
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:43.790
<v Speaker 2>If on the other hand you really value </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual liberty and globalism,</v>

679
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:44.683
<v Speaker 2>openness to the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to find yourself </v>

680
00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.780
<v Speaker 2>making alliances with these other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were forming your opponent.</v>

681
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:49.614
<v Speaker 2>So I think this is kind of big shuffling</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the deck going on in most Western </v>

682
00:31:51.621 --> 00:31:52.290
<v Speaker 2>democracies.</v>

683
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.230
<v Speaker 1>So as a historian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can you think of another time where</v>

684
00:31:55.231 --> 00:31:56.064
<v Speaker 1>we had such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not on a global scale because </v>

685
00:31:58.021 --> 00:31:58.854
<v Speaker 1>we're so connected now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where you saw just these real </v>

686
00:32:02.371 --> 00:32:03.204
<v Speaker 1>fractures happening in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when's the last time you saw </v>

687
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.380
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

688
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time it happened in the UK,</v>

689
00:32:08.091 --> 00:32:08.924
<v Speaker 2>certainly it was in the 19 sixties in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1970 and I think something like that </v>

690
00:32:11.421 --> 00:32:13.160
<v Speaker 2>happened over here in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>

691
00:32:13.161 --> 00:32:13.994
<v Speaker 2>where you had this sudden reversal where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the south went from being solidly </v>

692
00:32:18.021 --> 00:32:18.854
<v Speaker 2>democratic where you know if you found </v>
<v Speaker 2>two Republican votes that countered it </v>

693
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.143
<v Speaker 2>must have voted twice to the situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have now where the south is solidly </v>

694
00:32:26.541 --> 00:32:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Republican and Democrats will become the</v>
<v Speaker 2>party of the north entirely.</v>

695
00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.990
<v Speaker 2>That kind of switched took place then in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sixties and seventies.</v>

696
00:32:32.991 --> 00:32:33.824
<v Speaker 2>Similarly in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the eighties and nineties here </v>

697
00:32:36.261 --> 00:32:38.540
<v Speaker 2>in the United States with William </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jennings Bryan,</v>

698
00:32:38.541 --> 00:32:39.374
<v Speaker 2>the cross of and the famous Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>convention in Nineteen Ninety six when </v>

699
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:44.870
<v Speaker 2>the populous basically took over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democratic Party,</v>

700
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 2>major change in the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democratic Party landslide victory.</v>

701
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Republicans again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big realignment of votes and interest in</v>

702
00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:51.854
<v Speaker 2>the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then so this kind of thing has happened </v>

703
00:32:53.091 --> 00:32:53.450
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

704
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:54.283
<v Speaker 2>It's not unprecedented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you add about the global </v>

705
00:32:56.811 --> 00:32:58.660
<v Speaker 2>element where now it's like we're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected.</v>

706
00:32:58.670 --> 00:32:59.503
<v Speaker 2>We're all on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all watching TV and on the </v>

707
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:01.634
<v Speaker 2>Internet and that these things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening at once and that were 100 </v>

708
00:33:04.371 --> 00:33:06.830
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something happened across the pond,</v>

709
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.693
<v Speaker 2>it mattered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't know about it for awhile </v>

710
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.090
<v Speaker 2>versus now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all happening in real time.</v>

711
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.953
<v Speaker 2>This is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were more connections in </v>

712
00:33:13.321 --> 00:33:16.370
<v Speaker 2>you might imagine in the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as you rightly say,</v>

713
00:33:16.371 --> 00:33:17.204
<v Speaker 2>the much slower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now there is much more global </v>

714
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:19.700
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

715
00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.490
<v Speaker 2>what is interesting is that very few </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries where this kind of realignment</v>

716
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.630
<v Speaker 2>isn't happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada is one not happen.</v>

717
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.493
<v Speaker 2>That sofa a Spain is another Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking you can see the </v>

718
00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:30.374
<v Speaker 2>same thing happening everywhere and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think what happens is that what now </v>

719
00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:33.254
<v Speaker 2>because we're so interconnected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens in one part of the world </v>

720
00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:38.070
<v Speaker 2>tends to feed into what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere.</v>

721
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.103
<v Speaker 2>Hence the great interest that Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump and his supporters have shown in </v>

722
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Brexit and Nigel farage coming over here</v>
<v Speaker 2>and making all these talks.</v>

723
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.090
<v Speaker 2>That would not have happened 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago because I don't think that would've.</v>

724
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.263
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that would have happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago when I saw Nigel farrage </v>

725
00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:55.820
<v Speaker 2>out there at this rally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought this is really unprecedented.</v>

726
00:33:55.821 --> 00:33:59.930
<v Speaker 2>When is the last time that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a leader from another country,</v>

727
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.600
<v Speaker 2>even in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

728
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:02.390
<v Speaker 2>an ally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

729
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.223
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Came and with supporting the opposition </v>

730
00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:07.460
<v Speaker 2>and presidential candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought this is.</v>

731
00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.013
<v Speaker 2>They probably is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a function of note cheaper and </v>

732
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 2>travel and things like twitter and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

733
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>

734
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.253
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's shift a little bit from the </v>

735
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:20.360
<v Speaker 2>politics of the data is sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>broader stuff you describe yourself as a</v>

736
00:34:20.361 --> 00:34:20.780
<v Speaker 2>classical.</v>

737
00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

738
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:21.943
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now what is the difference so that I </v>

739
00:34:23.481 --> 00:34:25.730
<v Speaker 2>can explain it to my people properly </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they say,</v>

740
00:34:25.731 --> 00:34:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've become a libertarian.</v>

741
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.350
<v Speaker 2>How would you describe the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between a classical liberal,</v>

742
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:31.303
<v Speaker 2>liberal and a libertarian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there is really such a </v>

743
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.210
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The word Libertarian,</v>

744
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.073
<v Speaker 2>strictly speaking means an analyst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was originally used to describe </v>

745
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.850
<v Speaker 2>communist standard kits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

746
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.210
<v Speaker 2>he took her Pumpkin Bronte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem here in the United States is</v>

747
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.073
<v Speaker 2>the good word liberal has been hijacked </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Social Democrats and so unlike the </v>

748
00:34:50.391 --> 00:34:54.440
<v Speaker 2>European continent where liberal still </v>
<v Speaker 2>means a believer in private property,</v>

749
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:57.320
<v Speaker 2>limited government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little government intervention,</v>

750
00:34:57.321 --> 00:34:59.180
<v Speaker 2>individual liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pluralism,</v>

751
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.293
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now in the United States come to </v>

752
00:35:01.251 --> 00:35:02.084
<v Speaker 2>mean something slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the word libertarian came to be used </v>

753
00:35:05.181 --> 00:35:06.014
<v Speaker 2>here in the United States to mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically what everyone else would be </v>

754
00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:11.400
<v Speaker 2>called a classical liberal or a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>full stop.</v>

755
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.370
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think there is that much </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>

756
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.383
<v Speaker 2>There is perhaps a slight difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerging now in as much as increasingly </v>

757
00:35:17.601 --> 00:35:20.090
<v Speaker 2>the word libertarian does mean something</v>
<v Speaker 2>more radical,</v>

758
00:35:20.091 --> 00:35:24.200
<v Speaker 2>a bit more extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you say you're a libertarian,</v>

759
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.590
<v Speaker 2>you probably imply that you're either an</v>
<v Speaker 2>anarchist already close to it.</v>

760
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.360
<v Speaker 2>If you say you're a classical liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you imply that well you'll,</v>

761
00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll not advocates.</v>

762
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.130
<v Speaker 2>You do think there was a necessity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

763
00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:36.350
<v Speaker 2>So you're slightly more moderate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's what it's like.</v>

764
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.603
<v Speaker 2>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I like that distinction because </v>

765
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:39.864
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely where I fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is some use of the state </v>

766
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.170
<v Speaker 2>and then as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched the Libertarian party,</v>

767
00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:48.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their convention and it was like they're</v>

768
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:49.810
<v Speaker 2>screaming about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

769
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.590
<v Speaker 2>a driver's licenses and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

770
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:54.420
<v Speaker 2>you're really missing the ball here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:58.010
<v Speaker 2>like if we can't just let that go </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there were not going to.</v>

772
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.853
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're 100 percent right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to really deep construct </v>

773
00:36:03.031 --> 00:36:04.680
<v Speaker 2>an entire system like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there.</v>

774
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Like even if even if the libertarians </v>
<v Speaker 2>were purely purely right,</v>

775
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:11.580
<v Speaker 2>is there a way to actually take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning somewhat functioning society</v>

776
00:36:11.581 --> 00:36:15.070
<v Speaker 2>and really well the whole thing through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the political process.</v>

777
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.360
<v Speaker 2>No burning down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes.</v>

778
00:36:18.361 --> 00:36:19.051
<v Speaker 2>But no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>

779
00:36:19.051 --> 00:36:21.000
<v Speaker 2>the wage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you won't do on change science in the</v>

780
00:36:21.001 --> 00:36:21.834
<v Speaker 2>longer run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing to do is to do with the </v>

781
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:26.070
<v Speaker 2>grassroots level to create alternatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>to governments,</v>

782
00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:27.510
<v Speaker 2>which I think is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you shouldn't be doing.</v>

783
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.533
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think with the kind of policy </v>

784
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you're describing is rampantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>self-indulgent.</v>

785
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:33.443
<v Speaker 2>I would say this is the kind of politics</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a certain kind of person who is </v>

786
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.320
<v Speaker 2>interested in being more pure than </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>

787
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having an identity that is not </v>

788
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:44.094
<v Speaker 2>compromising completely pure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same kind of mentality that </v>

789
00:36:46.351 --> 00:36:47.184
<v Speaker 2>leads people to become religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalists of one variety or </v>

790
00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:50.010
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

791
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:50.843
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a desire to be the person in the </v>

792
00:36:52.261 --> 00:36:54.180
<v Speaker 2>group who is right when everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 2>is wrong,</v>

793
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:56.600
<v Speaker 2>and so the more of the people moved to </v>
<v Speaker 2>yours,</v>

794
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.473
<v Speaker 2>your position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you're going to insist upon </v>

795
00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:02.100
<v Speaker 2>these really extreme peculiar things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that still make you distinct.</v>

796
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.840
<v Speaker 2>So I'm afraid I'm not at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathetic.</v>

797
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.423
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just seems like a nonstarter </v>

798
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.610
<v Speaker 2>when they're screaming about legalizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>

799
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.560
<v Speaker 2>which we could talk about the war on </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

800
00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:12.180
<v Speaker 2>which you talked about a lot and I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to do that,</v>

801
00:37:12.181 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 2>but when they're going there to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>and drivers licenses to start,</v>

802
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:16.524
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

803
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:17.703
<v Speaker 2>this is not where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go for issues where you can persuade a </v>

804
00:37:20.191 --> 00:37:22.620
<v Speaker 2>significant part of the public to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your position.</v>

805
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.460
<v Speaker 2>That's what politics is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics.</v>

806
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.460
<v Speaker 2>It's all about striking a pose and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to show how morally pure you all.</v>

807
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.410
<v Speaker 2>That's just pure virtue signaling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say self indulgent nonsense.</v>

808
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.990
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to do is make clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>what your ultimate position is,</v>

809
00:37:33.991 --> 00:37:34.681
<v Speaker 2>but then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

810
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:35.514
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on you go for issues where you can </v>

811
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:38.214
<v Speaker 2>persuade the significant part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>broad public that you are right on that </v>

812
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.383
<v Speaker 2>yours is the way to go for and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you go from mainstream issue is </v>

813
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.320
<v Speaker 2>not a fringe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Issues like that,</v>

814
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.630
<v Speaker 2>which may be interesting for small </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people,</v>

815
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:53.631
<v Speaker 2>but then there's a fun discussion to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>had I suppose about that stuff,</v>

816
00:37:54.031 --> 00:37:56.150
<v Speaker 2>but not really a broader comes limiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

817
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:57.043
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do you decide how much state </v>

818
00:37:58.561 --> 00:38:01.230
<v Speaker 2>power is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

819
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.333
<v Speaker 2>How do you make that distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 2>pure anarchy and I want something to </v>

820
00:38:06.211 --> 00:38:09.660
<v Speaker 2>keep the wheels on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think state powers,</v>

821
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.270
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really just that.</v>

822
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.133
<v Speaker 2>The real distinction is between what </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of your life do you want to be </v>

823
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:17.154
<v Speaker 2>driven by individual choice or choices </v>
<v Speaker 2>made my voluntary collectives versus </v>

824
00:38:22.081 --> 00:38:22.914
<v Speaker 2>what parts of your life do you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be determined through some kind of </v>

825
00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 2>collective decision making process </v>
<v Speaker 2>through politics.</v>

826
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.353
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like your governance and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer that if you're a classical </v>

827
00:38:30.991 --> 00:38:31.824
<v Speaker 2>liberal you would give is that you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to maximize the scope of individual </v>

828
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:34.914
<v Speaker 2>decision making because that means </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater scope for individual discovery </v>

829
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 2>and the also means that most people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would argue the best judges of their</v>

830
00:38:42.491 --> 00:38:43.324
<v Speaker 2>own interests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you allow people to follow their </v>

831
00:38:45.131 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 2>own judgment is what their interests are</v>
<v Speaker 2>collectively,</v>

832
00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:48.304
<v Speaker 2>you'll end up with the best outcome that</v>
<v Speaker 2>maximizes human welfare so that that </v>

833
00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:54.910
<v Speaker 2>leaves though certain number of areas </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there may be structural problems.</v>

834
00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:56.980
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to act collectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>in these areas.</v>

835
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.140
<v Speaker 2>If you want to use a technical economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms,</v>

836
00:38:59.141 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's a public good aspect to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about.</v>

837
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:02.883
<v Speaker 2>National Defense and in these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably does pay to do things </v>

838
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:08.170
<v Speaker 2>through a collective decision making </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

839
00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:09.004
<v Speaker 2>There's something about these core areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means that they are so important </v>

840
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:13.623
<v Speaker 2>that they have to be on universally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't have a situation where say 90 </v>

841
00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:17.824
<v Speaker 2>percent are covered by the law </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcement system and 10 percent or </v>

842
00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:20.740
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

843
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:21.574
<v Speaker 2>that would have all kinds of major </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative effects for the 90 percent who </v>

844
00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:26.160
<v Speaker 2>were covered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nevermind the 10 percent who,</v>

845
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:27.023
<v Speaker 2>who weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a kind of limited range </v>

846
00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:29.171
<v Speaker 2>of areas where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

847
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:30.004
<v Speaker 2>you do definitely need the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know there are people who will </v>

848
00:39:31.901 --> 00:39:32.401
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

849
00:39:32.401 --> 00:39:32.711
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

850
00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in theory,</v>

851
00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:36.580
<v Speaker 2>yes you can do with that government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my own view is that,</v>

852
00:39:36.581 --> 00:39:37.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>

853
00:39:37.631 --> 00:39:38.464
<v Speaker 2>why isn't everyone going to Somalia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people say Somalia is better off </v>

854
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:43.384
<v Speaker 2>than some of its neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's true that if the choice is </v>

855
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.580
<v Speaker 2>anarchy or Pol Pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will go for anarchy.</v>

856
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.720
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that necessarily a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stateless state of affairs is your first</v>

857
00:39:52.721 --> 00:39:53.120
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

858
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for all the people that would say,</v>

859
00:39:54.981 --> 00:39:55.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

860
00:39:55.911 --> 00:39:58.210
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the pure libertarian or whatever you</v>

861
00:39:58.211 --> 00:39:59.960
<v Speaker 1>want to call them at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would say no,</v>

862
00:39:59.961 --> 00:40:02.660
<v Speaker 1>remove the social safety net altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

863
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:03.523
<v Speaker 1>don't help the poorest under any </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances because if the government </v>

864
00:40:06.261 --> 00:40:09.200
<v Speaker 1>gets out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then private entities and private people</v>

865
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.870
<v Speaker 1>will fully fill that void.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that's not.</v>

866
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:12.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe that that.</v>

867
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:13.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

868
00:40:13.831 --> 00:40:14.664
<v Speaker 2>the thing is I would ideally like to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>a situation where you don't have the </v>

869
00:40:17.521 --> 00:40:18.354
<v Speaker 2>government providing that function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the trouble is how'd you get from </v>

870
00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.160
<v Speaker 2>here to there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

871
00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:22.163
<v Speaker 2>And the difficulty is that if you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>simply withdraw government safety net </v>

872
00:40:24.811 --> 00:40:25.644
<v Speaker 2>provision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fundamental social welfare </v>

873
00:40:26.821 --> 00:40:27.654
<v Speaker 2>transfers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take a long time probably </v>

874
00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:33.540
<v Speaker 2>before you get something that takes its </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

875
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.153
<v Speaker 2>And in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are going to suffer </v>

876
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.433
<v Speaker 2>quite severely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that's acceptable </v>

877
00:40:38.611 --> 00:40:41.370
<v Speaker 2>quite honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the argument should be that,</v>

878
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.513
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should a through private action </v>

879
00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:49.110
<v Speaker 2>develop nonstate forms of welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should revive mutualism,</v>

880
00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.000
<v Speaker 2>friendly societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fraternal orders,</v>

881
00:40:51.001 --> 00:40:53.100
<v Speaker 2>all the great institutions that we used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have,</v>

882
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.130
<v Speaker 2>which delivered a huge range of welfare </v>
<v Speaker 2>functions very,</v>

883
00:40:56.131 --> 00:40:58.620
<v Speaker 2>very effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly here in the United States,</v>

884
00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:01.440
<v Speaker 2>so we should be looking to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>privately revived flat,</v>

885
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.980
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we got rid of those as the state.</v>

886
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens as the state groups,</v>

887
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.410
<v Speaker 2>the plus also though it was due to quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>concrete legislative measures,</v>

888
00:41:10.411 --> 00:41:14.460
<v Speaker 2>particularly ones urged by the medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>profession which were designed to drive,</v>

889
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.533
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendly societies out of healthcare </v>

890
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.710
<v Speaker 2>provision to what was called lodge </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

891
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:23.940
<v Speaker 2>That that was a purely legislative </v>
<v Speaker 2>function also crowding out by the state.</v>

892
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:24.923
<v Speaker 2>It was just a lobby group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The doctors got legislatures to pass </v>

893
00:41:29.101 --> 00:41:29.934
<v Speaker 2>laws which made it very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult for a private volunteer </v>

894
00:41:32.761 --> 00:41:34.460
<v Speaker 2>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing you need to do,</v>

895
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm done by two original point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to say that,</v>

896
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.821
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

897
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:41.090
<v Speaker 2>there is probably going to be a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom level,</v>

898
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.013
<v Speaker 2>a provision provided by government </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the political process to ensure </v>

899
00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 2>that nobody falls below a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum level.</v>

900
00:41:47.481 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 2>That nobody's starving the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do have a minimal amount of,</v>

901
00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>

902
00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that they can actually survive.</v>

903
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.673
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you can then do is get into </v>

904
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:56.743
<v Speaker 2>hydrostatic log about what the best way </v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing this is and certainly the way </v>

905
00:41:58.971 --> 00:41:59.804
<v Speaker 2>we're doing it now in many western </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries is not the best way of doing </v>

906
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:04.210
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a minor argument.</v>

907
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:06.590
<v Speaker 2>The major principle I think is you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>concede if,</v>

908
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.453
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in my position that there </v>

909
00:42:08.601 --> 00:42:11.090
<v Speaker 2>should be some kind of residual state </v>
<v Speaker 2>function of that salt.</v>

910
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Singapore probably has the best way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>

911
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:14.234
<v Speaker 2>I would say amongst which is why well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a system of forced savings </v>

912
00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:22.301
<v Speaker 2>where essentially you are obliged to pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>money into a series of accounts,</v>

913
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:26.450
<v Speaker 2>one of which covers your healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs mainly in old age,</v>

914
00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 2>one of which gives you a pension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another one gives you protection against</v>

915
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:31.483
<v Speaker 2>sickness or unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the crucial difference between that </v>

916
00:42:33.861 --> 00:42:36.380
<v Speaker 2>and the system we have is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts have your name on it,</v>

917
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:41.260
<v Speaker 2>so it's your money and you make these </v>
<v Speaker 2>for savings into these accounts,</v>

918
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

919
00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Your working life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've drawn them when you need them and</v>

920
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:45.800
<v Speaker 2>if you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

921
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fall under the proverbial bus,</v>

922
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:48.913
<v Speaker 2>all the money you paid in it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of your estate and goes to your </v>

923
00:42:52.251 --> 00:42:53.720
<v Speaker 2>heirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

924
00:42:53.721 --> 00:42:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a much better system than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>one we have here.</v>

925
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.043
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't just get pulled into </v>

926
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:01.700
<v Speaker 2>something else and it's your property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you die,</v>

927
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:04.940
<v Speaker 2>let's say you have a large mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be happy with this.</v>

928
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very effective.</v>

929
00:43:06.561 --> 00:43:07.394
<v Speaker 2>You've got a large amount in your health</v>
<v Speaker 2>savings account to cover the really </v>

930
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:12.650
<v Speaker 2>expensive part of healthcare which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking after you in the last six months</v>

931
00:43:12.651 --> 00:43:14.380
<v Speaker 2>of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let's say you,</v>

932
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 2>you die suddenly from a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like that,</v>

933
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.170
<v Speaker 2>that you weren't drawn in that fund and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there for your heirs.</v>

934
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.410
<v Speaker 2>It's part of your estate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

935
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm completely for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

936
00:43:23.831 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

937
00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:26.330
<v Speaker 2>they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

938
00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:28.750
<v Speaker 2>the state should be able to take that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're gone and,</v>

939
00:43:28.751 --> 00:43:30.350
<v Speaker 2>and give it to somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

940
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:32.390
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean the point is I think that's.</v>

941
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 2>I would argue against that for a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of reasons,</v>

942
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.100
<v Speaker 2>but I think that that's a much better </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and saying that's the system they</v>

943
00:43:37.101 --> 00:43:37.934
<v Speaker 2>have in Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what do they do for the people </v>

944
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:41.200
<v Speaker 2>that are outside of the system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

945
00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:44.030
<v Speaker 2>really poor the government actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes contributions on your behalf.</v>

946
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.260
<v Speaker 2>But Singapore is such a successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy and society that very,</v>

947
00:43:48.261 --> 00:43:49.094
<v Speaker 2>very few people are on such low incomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can't make some contribution </v>

948
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:53.503
<v Speaker 2>and the ones who have very low incomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say either the state's contribution </v>

949
00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:58.070
<v Speaker 2>is entirely the minimal level or at tops</v>
<v Speaker 2>them up.</v>

950
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 2>But that's actually a very marginal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small number of people.</v>

951
00:44:01.191 --> 00:44:04.580
<v Speaker 2>And so if we wanted to change to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that was a little more like that,</v>

952
00:44:04.581 --> 00:44:05.414
<v Speaker 2>and we've already hit on this a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>times about how incremental change is </v>

953
00:44:07.521 --> 00:44:08.354
<v Speaker 2>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to burn it down at </v>

954
00:44:08.961 --> 00:44:10.190
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

955
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.083
<v Speaker 2>how beyond just making the case for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hadn't even heard of that </v>

956
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Singapore thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now some new people are going to hear</v>

957
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:16.484
<v Speaker 2>about that concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you actually start making that </v>

958
00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:20.841
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

959
00:44:20.841 --> 00:44:22.610
<v Speaker 2>is that you have to start doing it at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the local level.</v>

960
00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get,</v>

961
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.163
<v Speaker 2>he knows probably that probably would </v>
<v Speaker 2>require a change at the national level </v>

962
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:27.584
<v Speaker 2>because you're talking about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>which would replace the way social </v>

963
00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:29.714
<v Speaker 2>security is currently run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will switch social from a pay as </v>

964
00:44:32.071 --> 00:44:34.500
<v Speaker 2>you go system to a fully funded system </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>

965
00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:35.334
<v Speaker 2>this kind that would require action by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress or at the very least maybe by </v>

966
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:40.200
<v Speaker 2>state legislatures for some of the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>forms.</v>

967
00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we just need to make the </v>

968
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:43.314
<v Speaker 2>political case written.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difficulty of course is that you </v>

969
00:44:45.001 --> 00:44:45.834
<v Speaker 2>have a whole bunch of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existing system who can't simply be </v>

970
00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:49.884
<v Speaker 2>switched over to the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to have a period of </v>

971
00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:52.674
<v Speaker 2>about 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly 20 years where there's an </v>

972
00:44:55.321 --> 00:44:58.410
<v Speaker 2>overlap where you have the new system in</v>
<v Speaker 2>place and you have people who are,</v>

973
00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:00.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under the old system.</v>

974
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.070
<v Speaker 2>That's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me.</v>

975
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:04.410
<v Speaker 2>And that means in the short run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this could be quite possibly,</v>

976
00:45:04.411 --> 00:45:05.970
<v Speaker 2>but I think in the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well worth doing.</v>

977
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

978
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:09.270
<v Speaker 2>So I heard you in a video that I saw you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do yesterday.</v>

979
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.433
<v Speaker 2>Talk about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how Libertarians are generally thought </v>

980
00:45:12.421 --> 00:45:14.120
<v Speaker 2>of as not interventionists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

981
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.830
<v Speaker 2>You think there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I don't think you prescribed to</v>

982
00:45:16.831 --> 00:45:17.664
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think there is a situation where a </v>

983
00:45:18.721 --> 00:45:22.830
<v Speaker 2>libertarian could be for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention.</v>

984
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the for any kind of libertarian,</v>

985
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 2>classical liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question with foreign policy is,</v>

986
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:30.504
<v Speaker 2>which course of action is going to most </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximize liberty both in the country </v>

987
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:36.054
<v Speaker 2>that is potentially doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervening in this case the US for </v>

988
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:38.964
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the part of the world where the </v>

989
00:45:40.231 --> 00:45:42.240
<v Speaker 2>intervention might take place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

990
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 2>That should be the guiding principle </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind what your foreign policy is.</v>

991
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would say,</v>

992
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.460
<v Speaker 2>and I agree with friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Randy Barnett on this,</v>

993
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.353
<v Speaker 2>is he's been on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing inherent or necessary </v>

994
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.740
<v Speaker 2>about libertarian principles that means </v>
<v Speaker 2>you must be a non interventionist.</v>

995
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.790
<v Speaker 2>What I would argue on they're here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps I disagree slightly with Randy,</v>

996
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.070
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

997
00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:05.423
<v Speaker 2>the number of cases where the benefits </v>
<v Speaker 2>of liberty will be so great that you </v>

998
00:46:08.401 --> 00:46:09.870
<v Speaker 2>would support intervention is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

999
00:46:09.871 --> 00:46:10.704
<v Speaker 2>very slight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would apply something like a just war </v>

1000
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:14.160
<v Speaker 2>principle.</v>

1001
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.610
<v Speaker 2>You have to show that really the benefit</v>
<v Speaker 2>is bound to exceed the cost,</v>

1002
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the,</v>

1003
00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.260
<v Speaker 2>this is knowable and that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention could be done in a way that</v>

1004
00:46:22.261 --> 00:46:24.780
<v Speaker 2>doesn't systematically violate human </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

1005
00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:26.490
<v Speaker 2>So that's quite a high bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's pause there for a sec.</v>

1007
00:46:27.461 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 2>How much does the benefit have to be for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and your society,</v>

1008
00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:33.390
<v Speaker 2>not just the people that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially doing?</v>

1009
00:46:33.391 --> 00:46:34.224
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more a matter of the cost </v>

1010
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:38.670
<v Speaker 2>because if you think about intervention </v>
<v Speaker 2>in foreign parts of the world,</v>

1011
00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.553
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the main arguments against that </v>

1012
00:46:40.471 --> 00:46:41.304
<v Speaker 2>from a libertarian or classical liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>position is that it actually is bad for </v>

1013
00:46:44.461 --> 00:46:45.294
<v Speaker 2>liberty back home in the country doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the intervening to the extent that the </v>

1014
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:52.620
<v Speaker 2>United States becomes an empire and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is an empire that's not pussy foot about</v>

1015
00:46:52.621 --> 00:46:55.890
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That undermines republican institutions.</v>

1016
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 2>And Liberty back home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not a new phenomenon.</v>

1017
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.013
<v Speaker 2>Many of the things that led to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth of the state in Great Britain </v>

1018
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:06.750
<v Speaker 2>were because of British intervention </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside the rest of the world.</v>

1019
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.630
<v Speaker 2>The India office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which ran the Indian empire,</v>

1020
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.613
<v Speaker 2>was our first big modern department of </v>
<v Speaker 2>States and then transformed the rest of </v>

1021
00:47:13.711 --> 00:47:15.670
<v Speaker 2>government by its example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same things.</v>

1022
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.500
<v Speaker 2>You do these things over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever there is,</v>

1023
00:47:19.501 --> 00:47:20.334
<v Speaker 2>and then you actually need more state </v>
<v Speaker 2>power at well under that is provides an </v>

1024
00:47:22.921 --> 00:47:25.650
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in order to have,</v>

1025
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.513
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to read large military if </v>

1026
00:47:27.421 --> 00:47:28.254
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a kind of global </v>
<v Speaker 2>interventionist role that inevitably </v>

1027
00:47:31.031 --> 00:47:33.730
<v Speaker 2>does things like increase the role of </v>
<v Speaker 2>military domestically,</v>

1028
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:36.760
<v Speaker 2>increases its purchasing power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its clout,</v>

1029
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 2>builds up the military industrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex that Eisenhower warned against,</v>

1030
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.273
<v Speaker 2>has all kinds of bad effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also leads to growth of a </v>

1031
00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:44.584
<v Speaker 2>surveillance state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It leads to the growth of the police </v>

1032
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 2>power of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we spoke about earlier,</v>

1033
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 2>which you might say is necessary in </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain cases,</v>

1034
00:47:51.341 --> 00:47:53.180
<v Speaker 2>but certainly not to the degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he now.</v>

1035
00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:58.090
<v Speaker 2>And it just also generally gives our </v>
<v Speaker 2>rulers ideas above their station because</v>

1036
00:47:58.091 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 2>if you have the mindset that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1037
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:00.544
<v Speaker 2>we can go over and be this benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>despot and transform the lives of these </v>

1038
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:04.414
<v Speaker 2>people in other parts of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tends to naturally create a </v>

1039
00:48:06.701 --> 00:48:07.331
<v Speaker 2>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think,</v>

1040
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:08.164
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's these people here in our own </v>

1041
00:48:08.771 --> 00:48:12.400
<v Speaker 2>society they could do with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>benevolent interference as well.</v>

1042
00:48:12.401 --> 00:48:13.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very dangerous mindset.</v>

1043
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:14.543
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somehow we always have money to do </v>

1044
00:48:15.931 --> 00:48:16.764
<v Speaker 1>those adventures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we never had money to help what's </v>

1045
00:48:18.961 --> 00:48:19.471
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1046
00:48:19.471 --> 00:48:20.360
<v Speaker 1>what a surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:21.450
<v Speaker 1>What could be happening there,</v>

1048
00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it benefits all kinds of people that </v>

1049
00:48:23.541 --> 00:48:24.374
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other quite shameful thing is that </v>

1050
00:48:25.251 --> 00:48:26.084
<v Speaker 2>this typically involves sending young </v>
<v Speaker 2>men from often poor backgrounds into </v>

1051
00:48:28.911 --> 00:48:29.744
<v Speaker 2>harms way when the children of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people making these decisions are </v>

1052
00:48:33.471 --> 00:48:36.350
<v Speaker 2>certainly not joining the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they are,</v>

1053
00:48:36.351 --> 00:48:38.270
<v Speaker 2>they're probably not going to be sent </v>
<v Speaker 2>into harms way in that way,</v>

1054
00:48:38.271 --> 00:48:39.104
<v Speaker 2>which I think is seriously disreputable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think I wouldn't rule out that </v>

1055
00:48:42.021 --> 00:48:46.340
<v Speaker 2>there are certain cases where an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention could be on balance,</v>

1056
00:48:46.341 --> 00:48:47.174
<v Speaker 2>beneficial for liberty both at home and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the place where the intervention </v>

1057
00:48:50.361 --> 00:48:51.194
<v Speaker 2>takes place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's vanishingly very low </v>

1058
00:48:53.721 --> 00:48:55.790
<v Speaker 2>probability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are very few cases like that in my</v>

1059
00:48:55.791 --> 00:48:56.150
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

1060
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

1061
00:48:57.171 --> 00:48:58.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just take Syria for example,</v>

1062
00:48:58.911 --> 00:49:02.360
<v Speaker 1>because that's obviously the big one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we know over 400,000</v>

1063
00:49:02.361 --> 00:49:06.620
<v Speaker 1>people are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing is not ending anytime soon.</v>

1064
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:10.580
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to know whose side we're on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with Iran and Russia,</v>

1065
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.890
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1066
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:14.023
<v Speaker 1>I think the main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mainstream libertarian think would </v>

1067
00:49:17.061 --> 00:49:22.061
<v Speaker 1>be even if we partly created this mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just got to cut our losses and let it</v>

1068
00:49:22.311 --> 00:49:23.630
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

1069
00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.553
<v Speaker 1>how does ethics and morality get </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved as a classical liberal where </v>

1070
00:49:27.051 --> 00:49:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1071
00:49:28.491 --> 00:49:29.324
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to be killing more people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe we could create humanitarian </v>

1072
00:49:32.121 --> 00:49:36.830
<v Speaker 1>corridors or maybe there's a way to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>some good there,</v>

1073
00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.290
<v Speaker 1>but it may not be cost effective for us.</v>

1074
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:42.510
<v Speaker 2>The question is who are the actors in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing?</v>

1075
00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Because people always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1076
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.140
<v Speaker 2>we got to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what should we do?</v>

1077
00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Who is the we in this sentence now I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think people get two things confused and</v>

1078
00:49:51.481 --> 00:49:54.150
<v Speaker 2>conflated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is what should civil society do?</v>

1079
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.013
<v Speaker 2>What should or can we do as individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're all kinds of things we can </v>

1080
00:49:57.931 --> 00:50:00.390
<v Speaker 2>do depending on what you think is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right course of action,</v>

1081
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.630
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing of course it means </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what should our government,</v>

1082
00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.600
<v Speaker 2>the government of United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United Kingdom,</v>

1083
00:50:06.601 --> 00:50:09.540
<v Speaker 2>wherever do now in terms of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments should do.</v>

1084
00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Governments in this context are </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically the purveyors of deadly force,</v>

1085
00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.713
<v Speaker 2>which is that core function and so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question therefore I think is slightly </v>

1086
00:50:17.671 --> 00:50:20.730
<v Speaker 2>different and really you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimize harm.</v>

1087
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:21.653
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me now I would argue that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the course of action that will </v>

1088
00:50:23.701 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 2>minimize harm in most cases is classic </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy realism.</v>

1089
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.863
<v Speaker 2>Because what you want to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimize the chances of war in large </v>

1090
00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:33.584
<v Speaker 2>scale conflict and I think actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>channeling bismarck is probably the way </v>

1091
00:50:36.591 --> 00:50:38.360
<v Speaker 2>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strange thing for liberals say,</v>

1092
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:42.410
<v Speaker 2>but I do think in foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking yourself the question,</v>

1093
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.273
<v Speaker 2>what would bismarck do is probably a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good way to go because foreign policy </v>

1094
00:50:47.031 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 2>rail is slight bismal do not generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>calls large scale walls.</v>

1095
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what you want to do.</v>

1096
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:55.370
<v Speaker 2>We'd be looking at what the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do.</v>

1097
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 2>You're looking to try and minimize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of armed conflict that happened.</v>

1098
00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you,</v>

1099
00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:02.410
<v Speaker 1>what would bismarck do in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's already begun?</v>

1100
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too late for us now,</v>

1101
00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.270
<v Speaker 1>but is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a moral cost,</v>

1102
00:51:07.271 --> 00:51:08.104
<v Speaker 1>I guess is what my question is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a moral cost of knowing that </v>

1103
00:51:10.391 --> 00:51:11.470
<v Speaker 1>something horrible has happened</v>

1104
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:15.050
<v Speaker 2>happening and that perhaps you could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something again?</v>

1105
00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:17.380
<v Speaker 2>It's who's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it's this?</v>

1106
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

1107
00:51:18.371 --> 00:51:20.980
<v Speaker 2>is if you're saying there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible going on there,</v>

1108
00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:22.203
<v Speaker 2>I feel a kind of moral responsibility as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human being for the suffering of my </v>

1109
00:51:24.401 --> 00:51:25.780
<v Speaker 2>fellow human beings in that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1110
00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:26.883
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of things you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can give money to a non government </v>

1111
00:51:29.171 --> 00:51:31.000
<v Speaker 2>organization or a charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of that medicine.</v>

1112
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.843
<v Speaker 2>So I'll prompt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1113
00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:36.090
<v Speaker 2>you might even volunteer to work with </v>
<v Speaker 2>MSF as adoptive you're a doctor,</v>

1114
00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:36.933
<v Speaker 2>a paramedic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might support things like the </v>

1115
00:51:38.621 --> 00:51:42.100
<v Speaker 2>creation of a lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government in Syria,</v>

1116
00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:46.330
<v Speaker 2>the competent is to allow people to lead</v>
<v Speaker 2>noncoms civilian sullied the combat.</v>

1117
00:51:46.331 --> 00:51:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Don't cease fires you might argue for if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1118
00:51:49.661 --> 00:51:51.430
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1119
00:51:51.431 --> 00:51:52.264
<v Speaker 2>I think that this is the right side in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this conflict and if you feel strongly </v>

1120
00:51:54.641 --> 00:51:56.740
<v Speaker 2>about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up a gun and go and fight that.</v>

1121
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.613
<v Speaker 2>That's the honest and vulnerable thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do or give money to help people </v>

1122
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.910
<v Speaker 2>acquire mysteries and things of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the other hand,</v>

1123
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.650
<v Speaker 2>the government is what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1124
00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:08.850
<v Speaker 2>My argument is that typically government</v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention,</v>

1125
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.713
<v Speaker 2>military intervention by states in </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicts of this kind is almost always </v>

1126
00:52:13.481 --> 00:52:15.400
<v Speaker 2>going to make the conflict more </v>
<v Speaker 2>intractable war,</v>

1127
00:52:15.401 --> 00:52:16.780
<v Speaker 2>bloody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more extensive,</v>

1128
00:52:16.781 --> 00:52:17.614
<v Speaker 2>more long lasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not going to be ultimately use </v>

1129
00:52:19.391 --> 00:52:21.790
<v Speaker 2>the interest even of the outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>parameters.</v>

1130
00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:25.840
<v Speaker 2>So much of this is driven by the desire </v>
<v Speaker 2>to avoid the other side getting on top.</v>

1131
00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:28.480
<v Speaker 2>And so you know the realist view there </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1132
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:29.703
<v Speaker 2>Usually steer clear of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless a vital national interest is at </v>

1133
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:32.523
<v Speaker 2>stake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not get involved because both on </v>

1134
00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:40.210
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic machiavellian grounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also on moral grounds because if you</v>

1135
00:52:40.211 --> 00:52:41.044
<v Speaker 2>intervene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is very likely to make the whole </v>

1136
00:52:41.831 --> 00:52:43.690
<v Speaker 2>conflict worse than the otherwise would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

1137
00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:45.311
<v Speaker 2>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1138
00:52:45.311 --> 00:52:48.490
<v Speaker 2>let me show this work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the case of Syria only predicted when</v>

1139
00:52:48.491 --> 00:52:50.320
<v Speaker 2>the Arab spring was going on that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>became serious.</v>

1140
00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:52.060
<v Speaker 2>It would be a bloodbath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1141
00:52:52.061 --> 00:52:53.640
<v Speaker 2>this didn't require great prescience </v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

1142
00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:54.903
<v Speaker 2>My part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the whole point about Syria is </v>

1143
00:52:56.651 --> 00:53:00.180
<v Speaker 2>that the government is dominated by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleanse,</v>

1144
00:53:00.181 --> 00:53:01.450
<v Speaker 2>stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious sect.</v>

1145
00:53:01.451 --> 00:53:02.284
<v Speaker 2>The News Irys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Alawites is what asset comes from </v>

1146
00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:05.523
<v Speaker 2>who come from the mountain regional </v>
<v Speaker 2>Latakia virtually all of the other </v>

1147
00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:12.260
<v Speaker 2>people in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly the Sunni Orthodox,</v>

1148
00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Sunni Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regard them as rank heretics.</v>

1149
00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.053
<v Speaker 2>That means that a democratic regime in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Syria is probably not feasible at the </v>

1150
00:53:19.541 --> 00:53:22.960
<v Speaker 2>moment because if I sat on the alibis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give up power.</v>

1151
00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.253
<v Speaker 2>You're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1152
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.133
<v Speaker 2>and they're not so not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I knew there would be armed </v>

1153
00:53:27.211 --> 00:53:29.160
<v Speaker 2>resistance to any movement to have for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state.</v>

1154
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Now wants the civil ward started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is what do you do?</v>

1155
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.370
<v Speaker 2>The problem I think as far as western </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy goes,</v>

1156
00:53:35.371 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 2>is that a large part of western policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been to try and overthrow Asad,</v>

1157
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:44.310
<v Speaker 2>but they have willed the end without </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing the means they've intervened,</v>

1158
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.293
<v Speaker 2>but the intervention has actually been </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a kind that has simply made the </v>

1159
00:53:48.331 --> 00:53:49.164
<v Speaker 2>conflict more intractable and gone on </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer and it's provoked countervailing </v>

1160
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:53.423
<v Speaker 2>intervention by the Iranians and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians who for their own strategic </v>

1161
00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:58.110
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to see ever overthrown,</v>

1162
00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.193
<v Speaker 2>so that shows how government </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention can actually make a </v>

1163
00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:03.570
<v Speaker 2>conflict that probably would have ended </v>
<v Speaker 2>one way or another.</v>

1164
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more intractable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My own view,</v>

1165
00:54:06.811 --> 00:54:07.644
<v Speaker 2>actually 40 it's worth is that the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>really effective way of resolving that </v>

1166
00:54:11.131 --> 00:54:13.710
<v Speaker 2>conflict is to partition Syria into </v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four states.</v>

1167
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the only way to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1168
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean incredibly.</v>

1169
00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Joe Biden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was running for president,</v>

1170
00:54:18.501 --> 00:54:22.490
<v Speaker 1>when he ended up being a Obama's bp at </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years ago,</v>

1171
00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:24.830
<v Speaker 1>there was a moment in the debates where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1172
00:54:24.831 --> 00:54:25.664
<v Speaker 1>we have to partition Syria and partition</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq and there should be an actual </v>

1173
00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:30.644
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish nation and this is the sooner </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have an agent in the sheet </v>

1174
00:54:32.391 --> 00:54:33.224
<v Speaker 1>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people laughed at him because it </v>

1175
00:54:34.161 --> 00:54:34.994
<v Speaker 1>sounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounded very academic and we're not </v>

1176
00:54:36.021 --> 00:54:38.150
<v Speaker 1>going to split these countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at this point,</v>

1177
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Syria is not really a nation state by </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

1178
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfectly rational solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was completed much about that.</v>

1179
00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Who looks at that part of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a political realist is going to say</v>

1180
00:54:47.391 --> 00:54:48.224
<v Speaker 2>that partitioning several of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>states that were created totally </v>

1181
00:54:50.691 --> 00:54:51.210
<v Speaker 2>artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1182
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:53.890
<v Speaker 1>By the British and the French during </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War II,</v>

1183
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:54.773
<v Speaker 1>even on geographic lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really unreduced just lines in the sand </v>

1184
00:54:57.811 --> 00:54:59.010
<v Speaker 1>as the famous book calls it,</v>

1185
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those states not viable.</v>

1186
00:55:01.261 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Speaker 2>They should really be broken up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1187
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.490
<v Speaker 2>that would be a rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humane response to the situation</v>

1188
00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.990
<v Speaker 1>you now have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1189
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.863
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to spend a ton of time with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this because we don't have that much </v>

1190
00:55:09.011 --> 00:55:09.790
<v Speaker 1>more time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how much,</v>

1191
00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:10.623
<v Speaker 1>how much of what's going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle East is just because of the guys </v>

1192
00:55:13.061 --> 00:55:13.894
<v Speaker 1>that were drawing the map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at a country like </v>

1193
00:55:14.771 --> 00:55:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks ridiculous.</v>

1194
00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.793
<v Speaker 1>The shape of Jordan is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a puzzle piece that got </v>

1195
00:55:20.201 --> 00:55:21.160
<v Speaker 1>mangled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1196
00:55:21.161 --> 00:55:21.994
<v Speaker 1>how much is just that the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually drawing the map had nothing to </v>

1197
00:55:25.001 --> 00:55:27.610
<v Speaker 1>do with what was happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

1198
00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.133
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame you guys solely for that </v>

1199
00:55:30.011 --> 00:55:31.920
<v Speaker 1>because the Ottoman empire ran a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for a long time.</v>

1200
00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

1201
00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.310
<v Speaker 2>What mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously,</v>

1202
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.163
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't most terms what they will say </v>

1203
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.350
<v Speaker 2>a pretty quickly is that things were </v>
<v Speaker 2>working a lot better.</v>

1204
00:55:38.351 --> 00:55:40.750
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they run it for you,</v>

1205
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:42.063
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1206
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.983
<v Speaker 2>if France Britain had followed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate anz and use the ultimate local </v>

1207
00:55:46.001 --> 00:55:49.720
<v Speaker 2>government units,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things might well have worked out better</v>

1208
00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:52.840
<v Speaker 2>because those units actually reflected </v>
<v Speaker 2>under underlying realities.</v>

1209
00:55:52.841 --> 00:55:53.674
<v Speaker 2>Many guises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but know that that's part of the </v>

1210
00:55:55.121 --> 00:55:57.010
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the problem in there as in large</v>

1211
00:55:57.011 --> 00:55:59.410
<v Speaker 2>areas of Africa is that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>political units,</v>

1212
00:55:59.411 --> 00:56:03.190
<v Speaker 2>which do not make demographic sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just that I think there are</v>

1213
00:56:03.191 --> 00:56:06.030
<v Speaker 2>other factors as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been a collapse in the,</v>

1214
00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:09.100
<v Speaker 2>in the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that huge area of the world,</v>

1215
00:56:09.101 --> 00:56:11.080
<v Speaker 2>central Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up through the Middle East,</v>

1216
00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:14.170
<v Speaker 2>places like Libya for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What has happened is that the state,</v>

1217
00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:15.004
<v Speaker 2>the political order has collapsed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're seeing is lots of violence </v>

1218
00:56:18.521 --> 00:56:22.930
<v Speaker 2>caused by nonstate actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically clans,</v>

1219
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 2>gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribes,</v>

1220
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 2>terrorists groups.</v>

1221
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.193
<v Speaker 2>We call them church people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we might as well call them criminal </v>

1222
00:56:27.311 --> 00:56:28.930
<v Speaker 2>gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they are basically,</v>

1223
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:30.183
<v Speaker 2>and until some kind of stable political </v>
<v Speaker 2>order is recreated in that part of the </v>

1224
00:56:33.191 --> 00:56:34.024
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that state of chaos ending </v>

1225
00:56:36.011 --> 00:56:36.844
<v Speaker 2>anytime soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that the existing </v>

1226
00:56:38.651 --> 00:56:39.484
<v Speaker 2>political order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where those guys sykes and </v>

1227
00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:42.293
<v Speaker 2>Pico come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is simply not sustainable because it's </v>

1228
00:56:45.251 --> 00:56:48.010
<v Speaker 2>based on an irrational thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that's going on there is</v>

1229
00:56:48.011 --> 00:56:48.844
<v Speaker 2>that basically you've had very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapid population growth in that </v>

1230
00:56:51.101 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 2>part of the world in the last 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 years.</v>

1231
00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:53.873
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably more than that region can </v>

1232
00:56:55.991 --> 00:56:59.620
<v Speaker 2>sustain ecologically and you have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy in large parts of that region,</v>

1233
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:03.400
<v Speaker 2>which is a very badly run because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupting of incompetent government and</v>

1234
00:57:03.401 --> 00:57:04.234
<v Speaker 2>be as very dependent upon oil and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have now is lots and lots of </v>

1235
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:12.450
<v Speaker 2>unemployed but overeducated young men </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is always and everywhere.</v>

1236
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.710
<v Speaker 2>A recipe for trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1237
00:57:14.711 --> 00:57:16.050
<v Speaker 2>It's fertile ground for terrorists.</v>

1238
00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a little saving grace in that </v>

1239
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.213
<v Speaker 2>because of the Internet now and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>information can spread so fast that </v>

1240
00:57:24.521 --> 00:57:25.354
<v Speaker 2>these people are learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's other ways of life and that may </v>

1241
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:30.640
<v Speaker 2>be that ultimately will be what allows </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to,</v>

1242
00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:31.653
<v Speaker 2>as they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to create societies that'll be a little </v>

1243
00:57:33.401 --> 00:57:34.300
<v Speaker 2>more egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1244
00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:35.213
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I am optimistic in the longer </v>

1245
00:57:36.551 --> 00:57:38.140
<v Speaker 2>term and the short term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pessimist.</v>

1246
00:57:38.141 --> 00:57:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid in the long run medium term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an optimist for that possible design</v>

1247
00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:41.953
<v Speaker 2>for most of the world because I do think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that things like that mean that the </v>

1248
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 2>world is going to become more </v>
<v Speaker 2>interconnected.</v>

1249
00:57:45.821 --> 00:57:48.990
<v Speaker 2>People are going to be more aware of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways of doing things too.</v>

1250
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:50.410
<v Speaker 2>We're back to what we spoke about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>

1251
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:51.543
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll realize that their identity is </v>

1252
00:57:52.451 --> 00:57:53.284
<v Speaker 2>not something that they're stuck with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can actually shape their own </v>

1253
00:57:54.941 --> 00:57:55.774
<v Speaker 2>life more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's going to be awhile </v>

1254
00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:57.780
<v Speaker 2>before we get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>

1255
00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:58.913
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole slew of other things I </v>

1256
00:57:59.591 --> 00:58:01.840
<v Speaker 2>want to talk to you about to finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

1257
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:02.703
<v Speaker 2>but we only have time for one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should we talk about drugs or is there </v>

1258
00:58:04.751 --> 00:58:07.870
<v Speaker 2>something that you want to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss that you feel like we hit?</v>

1259
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you.</v>

1260
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1261
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.153
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say a good interview is when I </v>

1262
00:58:12.041 --> 00:58:13.750
<v Speaker 2>don't look at the cards as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we did it here.</v>

1263
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:14.584
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about drugs a little bit </v>

1264
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:16.743
<v Speaker 2>because I think this is an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>place for the libertarian or classical </v>

1265
00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:19.954
<v Speaker 2>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You basically think that our war on </v>

1266
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:23.860
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was completely ridiculous.</v>

1267
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.430
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the worst policies ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1268
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be a better policy related to</v>

1269
00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.140
<v Speaker 2>drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are two things to do.</v>

1270
00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:34.810
<v Speaker 2>The first thing is quite simply to </v>
<v Speaker 2>legalize drugs,</v>

1271
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:36.610
<v Speaker 2>period across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the board.</v>

1272
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:41.170
<v Speaker 2>What people do not realize is until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>18 nineties,</v>

1273
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:42.183
<v Speaker 2>any drug was freely available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were in a chemist in Great </v>

1274
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:46.833
<v Speaker 2>Britain until 1922,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States until the age of 90 </v>

1275
00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.150
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could go in,</v>

1276
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:51.220
<v Speaker 2>you could order opm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could order morphine.</v>

1277
00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:52.383
<v Speaker 2>Arthur Conan doyle could go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemist in London and get his weekly </v>

1278
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:55.834
<v Speaker 2>supply of cocaine serious coke habit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why Sherlock Holmes has a coke </v>

1279
00:58:59.711 --> 00:59:00.544
<v Speaker 2>habits in the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this regime we now have as being </v>

1280
00:59:05.381 --> 00:59:08.350
<v Speaker 2>created peace mail since the 19 twenties</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

1281
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.213
<v Speaker 2>so it's not inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a specific policy response and the </v>

1282
00:59:12.551 --> 00:59:13.384
<v Speaker 2>results would have been catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has led to incredibly high rates of </v>

1283
00:59:16.811 --> 00:59:17.644
<v Speaker 2>incarceration here in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means countless lives ruined and </v>

1284
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:21.643
<v Speaker 2>severely damaged if not destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means it's given enormous amounts of </v>

1285
00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:26.564
<v Speaker 2>money to some seriously evil and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant people and led to the growth </v>

1286
00:59:29.571 --> 00:59:32.630
<v Speaker 2>of an enormous network of international </v>
<v Speaker 2>organized crime,</v>

1287
00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:34.220
<v Speaker 2>which would not otherwise exist.</v>

1288
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:35.383
<v Speaker 2>In terms of geopolitics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the major ways terrorist </v>

1289
00:59:37.461 --> 00:59:41.180
<v Speaker 2>organizations get money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a catastrophe in terms of that.</v>

1290
00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:43.550
<v Speaker 2>It's undermine the stability of large </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world.</v>

1291
00:59:43.551 --> 00:59:44.384
<v Speaker 2>Like Columbia for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Increasingly that's one of the reasons </v>

1292
00:59:46.911 --> 00:59:47.744
<v Speaker 2>why Venezuela was in bad shape quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from the incompetence of the </v>

1293
00:59:49.971 --> 00:59:50.804
<v Speaker 2>government of Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know there's like a war going on </v>

1294
00:59:53.001 --> 00:59:54.320
<v Speaker 2>in some parts of Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Them,</v>

1295
00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:55.173
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is an altar and it hasn't even </v>

1296
00:59:56.871 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 2>done the thing is meant to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is reduce the use of drugs.</v>

1297
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually this has gone up.</v>

1298
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:03.343
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an inevitable result of this policy </v>

1299
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.193
<v Speaker 2>is that the suppliers and the users both</v>
<v Speaker 2>go for harder drugs because he wants to </v>

1300
01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:10.454
<v Speaker 2>get more bang for the buck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want also to sell and to use </v>

1301
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.380
<v Speaker 2>products that are less bulky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to conceal.</v>

1302
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:16.363
<v Speaker 2>Same thing has happened with prohibition</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the 19 twenties were the </v>

1303
01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:19.514
<v Speaker 2>Americans went from being a beer </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking nation to being a hard liquor </v>

1304
01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:22.274
<v Speaker 2>drinking nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not what you want and what you </v>

1305
01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:27.110
<v Speaker 2>want to do is control alcohol trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say that this,</v>

1306
01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 2>in terms of its own goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a catastrophic policy failure.</v>

1307
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having said that,</v>

1308
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.153
<v Speaker 2>I'm not one of these people who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>channeling Timothy O'leary and thinks </v>

1309
01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:40.910
<v Speaker 2>that drugs are good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt there is a problem with</v>

1310
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.560
<v Speaker 2>widespread use of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worth saying,</v>

1311
01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:44.930
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the real problem anyway,</v>

1312
01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:45.893
<v Speaker 2>not least here in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the massive increase in the use of </v>

1313
01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:49.034
<v Speaker 2>prescription drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number of people who are psycho </v>

1314
01:00:52.001 --> 01:00:52.834
<v Speaker 2>truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big mood altering drugs is staggering </v>

1315
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.100
<v Speaker 2>and it has grown dramatically since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>1966.</v>

1316
01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:02.390
<v Speaker 2>So there's a more general problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug use in advanced countries,</v>

1317
01:01:02.391 --> 01:01:06.400
<v Speaker 2>particularly North America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of which illegal drug use is a subset.</v>

1318
01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Now that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I mistaken?</v>

1319
01:01:07.321 --> 01:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Are you guys in Britain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the commercials we have,</v>

1320
01:01:09.631 --> 01:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are They not legal there?</v>

1321
01:01:10.831 --> 01:01:11.664
<v Speaker 1>We get every commercial on every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on cable news for all of the </v>

1322
01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.333
<v Speaker 1>prescriptions.</v>

1323
01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:16.740
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all out now.</v>

1324
01:01:16.741 --> 01:01:18.900
<v Speaker 2>That's best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not allowed under the,</v>

1325
01:01:18.901 --> 01:01:19.734
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1326
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:21.870
<v Speaker 2>advertising regulations in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kingdom.</v>

1327
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:22.853
<v Speaker 2>That might be a regulation I'd before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is strange when you're watching </v>

1328
01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:27.143
<v Speaker 2>television in the United States to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>just everyone this country suffer from </v>

1329
01:01:29.251 --> 01:01:30.084
<v Speaker 2>in large.</v>

1330
01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got that on a cartoon,</v>

1331
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>a cloud following you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1332
01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1333
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:37.110
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think is that what you need to do</v>

1334
01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.273
<v Speaker 2>is to have a social movement to address </v>
<v Speaker 2>the undoubted real problems with the </v>

1335
01:01:43.621 --> 01:01:47.310
<v Speaker 2>drug trade in which you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the government got out of this and my</v>

1336
01:01:47.311 --> 01:01:48.144
<v Speaker 2>model would be temperance were in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>19th century at the start of the 19th </v>

1337
01:01:51.061 --> 01:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on both sides of the Atlantic.</v>

1338
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much everyone was in a drunken </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupor most of the time.</v>

1339
01:01:55.830 --> 01:01:58.770
<v Speaker 2>The amount of drinking was nominal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>binding.</v>

1340
01:01:58.771 --> 01:02:00.120
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties and nineties.</v>

1341
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.073
<v Speaker 2>Most prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great majority of Americans have </v>

1342
01:02:02.271 --> 01:02:03.104
<v Speaker 2>become seriously sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who maybe drink very </v>

1343
01:02:05.311 --> 01:02:07.140
<v Speaker 2>occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not heavy drinkers the way their</v>

1344
01:02:07.141 --> 01:02:09.510
<v Speaker 2>grandparents had been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not due to government.</v>

1345
01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:13.710
<v Speaker 2>It's due to the enormous social movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>of temperance,</v>

1346
01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.753
<v Speaker 2>which unfortunately also wanted to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>the law to stop the residual temp </v>

1347
01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.580
<v Speaker 2>central and drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even think about smoking.</v>

1348
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not keen on all the antismoking laws</v>

1349
01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:23.994
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand there's been a </v>

1350
01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:26.900
<v Speaker 2>huge change in social attitudes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking,</v>

1351
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:27.783
<v Speaker 2>just made socially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not the thing to do to smoking </v>

1352
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.030
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to address the underlying</v>

1353
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:33.873
<v Speaker 2>problem that we have with drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's through social actual bank kind of </v>

1354
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.713
<v Speaker 2>war on drugs is actually making that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of effective social action less </v>

1355
01:02:40.231 --> 01:02:43.920
<v Speaker 2>likely and causing a ton of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1356
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:44.783
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the smoking one must be a tough one </v>

1357
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>for you though because on one hand at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least here our taxes are incredibly high</v>

1358
01:02:50.701 --> 01:02:51.534
<v Speaker 2>and smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a government so they sort of </v>

1359
01:02:52.801 --> 01:02:53.634
<v Speaker 2>tried to price it out of the market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I guess you wouldn't really well </v>

1360
01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:58.950
<v Speaker 2>or I don't think the ultra price sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>market quite more.</v>

1361
01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:01.440
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to maximize their </v>
<v Speaker 2>revenue,</v>

1362
01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:02.274
<v Speaker 2>which is something different because our</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory of these taxes is they're meant </v>

1363
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:04.650
<v Speaker 2>to stop.</v>

1364
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:05.483
<v Speaker 2>You and I are buying cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually I don't like the US </v>

1365
01:03:07.711 --> 01:03:08.544
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The British government would have a </v>

1366
01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:14.340
<v Speaker 2>panic fits if people stop smoking </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they get 7 billion pounds a year</v>

1367
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:16.040
<v Speaker 2>of revenue from smoking taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1368
01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.190
<v Speaker 2>So in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need it.</v>

1369
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus also,</v>

1370
01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really ought to encourage people to</v>

1371
01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:23.080
<v Speaker 2>smoke because if you smoke you're likely</v>
<v Speaker 2>to die younger.</v>

1372
01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:25.740
<v Speaker 2>You won't be claiming a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare benefits.</v>

1373
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.113
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point about that is that that is </v>

1374
01:03:29.011 --> 01:03:29.844
<v Speaker 2>actually a very bad policy because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>demand for cigarettes and tobacco </v>

1375
01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:34.554
<v Speaker 2>products is highly inelastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you're doing actually is </v>

1376
01:03:36.511 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 2>hurting the poor more than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are other ways of doing it.</v>

1377
01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.770
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social pressure.</v>

1378
01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what about for the person?</v>

1379
01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:46.170
<v Speaker 2>So I'm pretty much with you on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical part of how the government</v>

1380
01:03:46.171 --> 01:03:49.890
<v Speaker 2>should deal with this and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the actual tangible part of drugs.</v>

1381
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:51.830
<v Speaker 2>I would have some concern if they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>say if,</v>

1382
01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.920
<v Speaker 2>if heroin was lead with legal tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1383
01:03:54.921 --> 01:03:57.300
<v Speaker 2>and kids could just get it at a border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you look,</v>

1384
01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.060
<v Speaker 2>we're here in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are pot stores on every corner.</v>

1385
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.180
<v Speaker 2>I have a law license for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not doing something illegal,</v>

1386
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:04.770
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do for the real.</v>

1387
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even talking about the Timothy </v>
<v Speaker 2>leary mushroom stuff,</v>

1388
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have met them really addictive </v>

1389
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.193
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well actually meet some of the drugs </v>

1390
01:04:12.001 --> 01:04:12.834
<v Speaker 2>that are on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be much more worried about things </v>

1391
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:17.270
<v Speaker 2>like sedatives or cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The level would be heroin actually.</v>

1392
01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's another matter.</v>

1393
01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is to say that drugs should be</v>

1394
01:04:21.841 --> 01:04:23.610
<v Speaker 2>sold legally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does not mean that to be a complete free</v>

1395
01:04:23.611 --> 01:04:25.980
<v Speaker 2>for all a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would clearly be regulations,</v>

1396
01:04:25.981 --> 01:04:27.780
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that people cannot buy them below</v>

1397
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:30.660
<v Speaker 2>a certain age just as we have with </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol and tobacco for good reason.</v>

1398
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:31.583
<v Speaker 2>Because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd think that somebody under a </v>

1399
01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:34.440
<v Speaker 2>certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you set arbitrarily,</v>

1400
01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:37.140
<v Speaker 2>it does not have the judgment to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not they should do this.</v>

1401
01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:38.820
<v Speaker 2>And you should enforce laws on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1402
01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:40.320
<v Speaker 2>very strictly and very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very firmly.</v>

1403
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:41.363
<v Speaker 2>You might well have a system where </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain categories of drugs or </v>

1404
01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:45.750
<v Speaker 2>substances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you basically say,</v>

1405
01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:46.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1406
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.233
<v Speaker 2>you could do with the Swedish government</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried alcohol and have a rationing </v>

1407
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.140
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are various ways around that.</v>

1408
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:53.640
<v Speaker 2>The point is it wouldn't be just a case </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1409
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:54.503
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can walk into any store and just </v>

1410
01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.380
<v Speaker 2>buying your your shots of morphine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin over the counter,</v>

1411
01:04:58.381 --> 01:05:02.380
<v Speaker 2>like almost certainly there'll be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole array of a legislation.</v>

1412
01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.243
<v Speaker 2>The point is it will be sold by a legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>retailer who would have strong </v>

1413
01:05:06.751 --> 01:05:07.584
<v Speaker 2>incentives to have high quality product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to sell it to people who are going </v>

1414
01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:11.364
<v Speaker 2>to be problematic in one way or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they would have a vicarious </v>

1415
01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:15.240
<v Speaker 2>liability under the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1416
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:16.343
<v Speaker 2>and unlike the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the where that being sold by seriously </v>

1417
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>dodgy people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminals of the worst kind who actually</v>

1418
01:05:22.811 --> 01:05:27.811
<v Speaker 2>have an incentive to not care about who </v>
<v Speaker 2>they sell it to sell it.</v>

1419
01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:31.690
<v Speaker 2>So actually if you're concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>protecting vulnerable people,</v>

1420
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:33.570
<v Speaker 2>which is what we're talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1421
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Then actually making the sale of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance legal is the way to go because</v>

1422
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:39.544
<v Speaker 2>it means that you're much more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to look out for their interests </v>

1423
01:05:41.381 --> 01:05:44.950
<v Speaker 2>and the sellers are much less likely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an incentive to screw them over,</v>

1424
01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:45.600
<v Speaker 2>to be blunt.</v>

1425
01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly,</v>

1426
01:05:46.621 --> 01:05:48.600
<v Speaker 1>it gets back to sort of what's been the </v>
<v Speaker 1>through line here,</v>

1427
01:05:48.601 --> 01:05:51.960
<v Speaker 1>which is that a little government </v>
<v Speaker 1>involvement in a certain way.</v>

1428
01:05:51.961 --> 01:05:52.381
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1429
01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:53.214
<v Speaker 1>So I almost think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost think that my new phrase now </v>

1430
01:05:55.261 --> 01:05:57.210
<v Speaker 1>when people say classical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a classical liberal?</v>

1431
01:05:57.450 --> 01:06:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I almost think it's a realistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian.</v>

1432
01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you think</v>

1433
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:02.050
<v Speaker 2>that's a good way of putting it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1434
01:06:02.051 --> 01:06:02.884
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean the thing is say very often </v>

1435
01:06:04.571 --> 01:06:05.404
<v Speaker 2>limited government and small limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>government even more so is a lot more </v>

1436
01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:12.820
<v Speaker 2>effective at achieving the ends that big</v>
<v Speaker 2>government liberals wanted to have.</v>

1437
01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.250
<v Speaker 2>The big government is very good than </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1438
01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a perfect way to end </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1439
01:06:17.001 --> 01:06:19.000
<v Speaker 1>It's been a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't look down lines.</v>

1440
01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:20.460
<v Speaker 1>That's how I know it's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1441
01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>for more.</v>
