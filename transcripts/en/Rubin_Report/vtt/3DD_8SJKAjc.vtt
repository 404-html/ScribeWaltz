1
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Is it just me or is Internet culture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trolling,</v>

2
00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:10.310
<v Speaker 1>the outrage and the endless hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to eat itself?</v>

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.413
<v Speaker 1>This election obviously brought out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst in almost everybody from real </v>

4
00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>people to twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs and atomy avatars.</v>

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.440
<v Speaker 1>People are constantly attacking others </v>
<v Speaker 1>online and saying things that they would</v>

6
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:24.140
<v Speaker 1>never dare say to someone's face in real</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 1>The really scary part of this though </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the words you guys know.</v>

8
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:28.484
<v Speaker 1>I love free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there seems to be no bottom to this </v>

9
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:31.724
<v Speaker 1>whole of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think about your facebook and </v>

10
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>twitter feeds for a moment or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightening,</v>

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.780
<v Speaker 1>interesting and bringing joy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodness to your life.</v>

12
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Or are they an endless cascade of rants </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Raves,</v>

13
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:42.770
<v Speaker 1>psychotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ramblings,</v>

14
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>endless fighting and nonstop virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>signaling.</v>

15
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go out on a limb here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess that for most of you,</v>

16
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>the answer is the latter.</v>

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Not the former,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>

18
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>there are also a lot of baby pictures on</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook which can be quite annoying.</v>

19
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.173
<v Speaker 1>What I think is most interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 1>our constant state of bickering isn't </v>

20
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>the obvious fact that the Internet can </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring out the worst in all of us,</v>

21
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.673
<v Speaker 1>but that it seems to me that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and the reaction to it is now </v>

22
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:07.484
<v Speaker 1>bleeding out into the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm slammed with emails every day in </v>

23
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:11.444
<v Speaker 1>which people explained to me how they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering real world consequences for </v>

24
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.690
<v Speaker 1>what they post or even what they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>post online.</v>

25
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.883
<v Speaker 1>People are getting fired over tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing friends over facebook posts and </v>

26
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.260
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what's happening on </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapchat,</v>

27
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.513
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps worse than all of this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chilling effect that this state of </v>

28
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>outrage has on the rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I've said it before and I'll</v>

29
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 1>say it again.</v>

30
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.973
<v Speaker 1>The biggest threat to free speech is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are actively silencing </v>

31
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that the government is silencing us.</v>

32
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.493
<v Speaker 1>The threat to free speech isn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>that protesters are violent at a milo </v>

33
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:46.754
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the trickle down effect that that </v>

34
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're violent events for people.</v>

35
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I conservatives and Libertarians such as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro and Charles Murray,</v>

36
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.960
<v Speaker 1>but of course it won't stop there </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

37
00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Eventually they'll come for liberals to </v>
<v Speaker 1>while at the same time,</v>

38
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:04.760
<v Speaker 1>plenty of other people who just won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to deal with the threats.</v>

39
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Simply won't accept invitations to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>

40
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.313
<v Speaker 1>The outrage machine will just dull us </v>
<v Speaker 1>all down to the point where we won't </v>

41
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:12.974
<v Speaker 1>share any original thought because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>just won't want to deal with the </v>

42
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:16.004
<v Speaker 1>repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what's happening with </v>

43
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:18.554
<v Speaker 1>trump right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mainstream media and the twitter </v>

44
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>brigade go bananas every time anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

45
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.763
<v Speaker 1>The result is that people won't be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to gauge the proper outrage if he does </v>

46
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 1>do something that truly warranted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

47
00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:35.090
<v Speaker 1>he eats his steak with ketchup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it is well done.</v>

48
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>That sounds horrible to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to deal with it.</v>

49
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Remember the boy who cried wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>now we've got the media who cried?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>

51
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you think I'm being alarmist here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>do we see more politically correct or </v>
<v Speaker 1>less politically correct than five years</v>

53
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about 10 years ago?</v>

54
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you find yourself censoring yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less?</v>

55
00:02:55.641 --> 00:03:00.641
<v Speaker 1>Now than you did even last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is forcing you to censor yourself?</v>

56
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Is it the government?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

57
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I bet you need only look in the mirror </v>
<v Speaker 1>and guess what?</v>

58
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.203
<v Speaker 1>This creep of stifling speech for fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being ostracized isn't going to </v>

59
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>magically reverse itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to proactively fight it,</v>

60
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>and we should have started this a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago.</v>

61
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Take a minute and think about our </v>
<v Speaker 1>current television programming.</v>

62
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.693
<v Speaker 1>Could all in the family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably the best Sitcom in television </v>

63
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>history with a bigoted yet lovable </v>
<v Speaker 1>archie bunker,</v>

64
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.893
<v Speaker 1>possibly be on network television today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beauty of archie was that we all </v>

65
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>know someone like him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that person is white,</v>

66
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or blue.</v>

67
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.133
<v Speaker 1>Only through seeing these people poking </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun at them and showing the short </v>

68
00:03:41.361 --> 00:03:42.194
<v Speaker 1>sightedness of bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we change our society to be more </v>

69
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful and decent for everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when I watched Seinfeld with all of</v>

70
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>its quirky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racially based characters,</v>

71
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>jokes about gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

72
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:53.734
<v Speaker 1>and everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the authoritarians will </v>

73
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 1>come for the show about nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was really a show about everything</v>

74
00:03:59.081 --> 00:03:59.914
<v Speaker 1>one day as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It won't be the government kicking </v>

75
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:02.794
<v Speaker 1>Jerian the crew off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be the next generation of social </v>

76
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:06.724
<v Speaker 1>justice warriors upset about the episode</v>
<v Speaker 1>where George wanted a black friend or </v>

77
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:11.794
<v Speaker 1>where Kramer wouldn't wear the aids </v>
<v Speaker 1>ribbon or the ones with characters like </v>

78
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:19.681
<v Speaker 1>ping the Chinese delivery guy or baboo </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pakistani restaurant tour beyond the</v>

79
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>outrage machine.</v>

80
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>There is another nefarious layer here </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a whole group of people who get</v>

81
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>off on the outrage itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the group of people who react to</v>

82
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.453
<v Speaker 1>anything in everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to get clicks and ultimately money </v>

83
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:34.534
<v Speaker 1>from our constant state of outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when Pewdie Pie makes a stupid joke </v>

84
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>about Jews as they did a couple of weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

85
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.373
<v Speaker 1>the bigger reaction is from those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to capitalize on the moment rather </v>

86
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>than those who are actually outraged by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the joke itself.</v>

87
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.083
<v Speaker 1>Then the mainstream media gets involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Wall Street Journal writing </v>

88
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:52.354
<v Speaker 1>about the incident which subsequently </v>
<v Speaker 1>led maker studios to end their contract </v>

89
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:57.124
<v Speaker 1>with Pewdie Pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This destructive force will take anyone </v>

90
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>down who has moved up to far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The youtuber is attacking Pewdie Pie.</v>

91
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.074
<v Speaker 1>Wish they had his 55 million subscribers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Wall Street Journal's sees how </v>

92
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>his influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

93
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.390
<v Speaker 1>is now dwarfing their own as online </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

94
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>It gets woven into every facet of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

95
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>It's vital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all pick up and choose our spots when</v>

96
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>to fight and when to be outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're outraged at everything,</v>

97
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:25.234
<v Speaker 1>then we're outraged at nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we spend all day online trying to </v>

98
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>find enemies as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then guess what?</v>

99
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.023
<v Speaker 1>Enemies will present themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making some intellectual point over an </v>

100
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>opponent has value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to be careful that the value</v>

101
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.680
<v Speaker 1>isn't because of the retweets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorites it garners.</v>

102
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I can be better at some of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

103
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on twitter.</v>

104
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.533
<v Speaker 1>Trolls are always going to troll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those of us who want to change </v>

105
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>things for the better have to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>be better ourselves.</v>

106
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.583
<v Speaker 1>Final thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a guest on the Alex Jones live </v>

107
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>show last week at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you may have seen,</v>

108
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.153
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even fully familiar with Alex </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the little bites I see of him </v>

109
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>screaming and generally going nuts.</v>

110
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.703
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy has a huge audience and is </v>

111
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>clearly influential as mainstream media </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumbles and online media rises.</v>

112
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.843
<v Speaker 1>As I've said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this comes with both positives and </v>

113
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>negatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but regardless,</v>

114
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>the fact is the guy is talking to a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people.</v>

115
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Immediately when I got the request to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the show,</v>

116
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.044
<v Speaker 1>I thought that I shouldn't do it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ton of hate that I was about to </v>

117
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:24.194
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I realized that if I didn't do the </v>

118
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:26.624
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would only be holding myself hostage </v>

119
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:28.904
<v Speaker 1>to the very same ideas which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>silencing so many other people right </v>

120
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I did the show with no preparation or</v>

121
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>advanced questioning and Alex let me say</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I wanted to say.</v>

122
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.073
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the usual hate from the usual </v>

123
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 1>haters just for appearing on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also know that I got some of the ideas</v>

124
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 1>that I care about to be heard by his </v>
<v Speaker 1>large audience.</v>

125
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe some of them will come here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and learn more about the issues that you</v>

126
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>and I care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of those new viewers,</v>

127
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't yell as much,</v>

128
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>but I think you'll dig it around here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the record,</v>

129
00:06:58.821 --> 00:06:59.654
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe that a secret group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lizard people are leading a shadow </v>

130
00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:03.554
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is trying to undermine our </v>

131
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:06.440
<v Speaker 1>freedoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

132
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:07.274
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a group of frog men led by</v>
<v Speaker 1>pepe and they're actually a bunch of </v>

133
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>freedom fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck to us all.</v>

134
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.113
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is the author of </v>
<v Speaker 1>several books and the founder and </v>

135
00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:24.030
<v Speaker 1>current president of the David Horowitz </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freedom Center.</v>

136
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.930
<v Speaker 2>David Horowitz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

137
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.483
<v Speaker 2>What are the chances that you ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>being the president of a place called </v>

138
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:31.510
<v Speaker 2>the David Horowitz Freedom Center?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

139
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.760
<v Speaker 2>that is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually fought that name,</v>

140
00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:35.890
<v Speaker 2>but my board said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

141
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I had named it the center for the study </v>
<v Speaker 2>of popular culture as a,</v>

142
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.663
<v Speaker 2>as a leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it's a very hard to attack a </v>

143
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.230
<v Speaker 2>center for studying anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone just.</v>

144
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.230
<v Speaker 2>But conservatives see the word culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they think left.</v>

145
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.830
<v Speaker 2>So there was just confusing skype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amy and I said,</v>

146
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.690
<v Speaker 2>just kind of put your name on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

147
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 2>So here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

148
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.383
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the years that I've been doing this </v>

149
00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:08.271
<v Speaker 2>show that I've read anyone's bio and </v>
<v Speaker 2>found it more interesting than your bio,</v>

150
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.273
<v Speaker 2>it will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least not someone that was born in </v>

151
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:11.860
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just,</v>

152
00:08:11.861 --> 00:08:13.150
<v Speaker 2>there's so much richness there.</v>

153
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:13.983
<v Speaker 2>Your evolution politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a lot to do with some of the </v>

154
00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:17.164
<v Speaker 2>things that you write about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about going from the left to the right </v>

155
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:20.320
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

156
00:08:20.321 --> 00:08:22.240
<v Speaker 2>so I want to start with your history </v>
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

157
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Your parents were communists hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary card carry everybody.</v>

158
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.383
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the communist that kids that </v>

159
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 2>think it's cool today doing an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

160
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 2>These are people who are part of a vast </v>
<v Speaker 2>international conspiracy orchestrated by</v>

161
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

162
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.950
<v Speaker 2>my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

163
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.093
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think my mother ever got a </v>

164
00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:45.010
<v Speaker 2>traffic ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

165
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.830
<v Speaker 2>they were very middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not break the law,</v>

166
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.630
<v Speaker 2>but they did hide and East German </v>
<v Speaker 2>communist in the basement.</v>

167
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the government wanted to deport</v>

168
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did he get to your basement?</v>

169
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very young.</v>

170
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 3>Did you know there was someone down </v>
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

171
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:04.044
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you notice something was going to </v>

172
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.920
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was his name the last name?</v>

173
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 3>His brother was the mayor of East </v>
<v Speaker 3>Berlin.</v>

174
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

175
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

176
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:15.474
<v Speaker 3>they were very conspiratorial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never referred to themselves as </v>

177
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:22.990
<v Speaker 3>communists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only as progressives.</v>

178
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Even then because it wasn't a dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

179
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.820
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very dirty.</v>

180
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 3>He was a dirty word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very healthy period.</v>

181
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 3>But because this anya American left very</v>
<v Speaker 3>subversive,</v>

182
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 3>ready to work with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our enemies the up.</v>

183
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:40.254
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a horrible totalitarian dictatorship </v>

184
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.663
<v Speaker 3>where effectively quarantined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We lived in a kind of ghetto where you </v>

185
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 3>couldn't say what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you believed in that for a Democrat</v>

186
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 3>with a small d for a liberal minded </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

187
00:09:58.291 --> 00:09:59.124
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't seem right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was actually healthy given the </v>

188
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 3>cold war at the time.</v>

189
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.363
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

190
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 3>so what did it mean to have a stigma on </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who hate this country?</v>

191
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.280
<v Speaker 3>We've lost that completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

192
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 3>so we'll get to that part because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>really sort of,</v>

193
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.960
<v Speaker 3>that gets to the evolution part of where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at.</v>

194
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 3>We were stigmatized and a well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did they believe?</v>

195
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Like what did that actually mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you said you were a communist,</v>

196
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.770
<v Speaker 3>and we're talking the 19 forties now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

197
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.023
<v Speaker 3>My mother was a registered Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anything different from </v>

198
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:35.820
<v Speaker 3>certainly not the Democratic Party of </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

199
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.180
<v Speaker 3>although then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

200
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 3>when Roosevelt was president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were all happy Democrats.</v>

201
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:42.384
<v Speaker 3>When Truman declared that America would </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend free peoples fighting for their </v>

202
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:52.500
<v Speaker 3>freedom against the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all defected.</v>

203
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 3>And that formed the Progressive Party </v>
<v Speaker 3>which was run by the Communist Party.</v>

204
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then around 1956,</v>

205
00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the information that comes out about</v>

206
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Stalin and then that sort of.</v>

207
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.503
<v Speaker 3>That was my away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 17 at the time and that was my </v>

208
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.050
<v Speaker 3>kind of awakening that everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the William Buckley's.</v>

209
00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:15.120
<v Speaker 3>So we hated to write that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right set,</v>

210
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:18.150
<v Speaker 3>the right set of Stalin had killed 7 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million people.</v>

211
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:21.190
<v Speaker 3>He actually killed about 40 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

212
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.780
<v Speaker 3>and we said was this was all anti-soviet</v>
<v Speaker 3>lies.</v>

213
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 3>The Soviet Union was a paradise of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

214
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Everybody equal everybody working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody happy,</v>

215
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.920
<v Speaker 3>all lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we've,</v>

216
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.573
<v Speaker 3>my community believed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Khrushchev came along with </v>

217
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:42.900
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave it a secret speech that the Israeli</v>

218
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.733
<v Speaker 3>Mossad smuggled out and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it blew up my community that there were </v>

219
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:49.464
<v Speaker 3>divorces in our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we do have a over people over the </v>

220
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 3>Khrushchev report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People felt betrayed.</v>

221
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 3>They had lived a lie and other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>felt,</v>

222
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you continue,</v>

223
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 3>you go on and they defended it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

224
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.790
<v Speaker 3>And that made marriage is untenable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

225
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 3>You think p,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's tough now for marriages when people</v>

226
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:12.060
<v Speaker 3>are going to.</v>

227
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 3>I love trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate trump,</v>

228
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:14.290
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's why.</v>

229
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 3>That's earthshaking stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your whole narrative.</v>

230
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I came into the,</v>

231
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:20.763
<v Speaker 3>when I went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean my mission self self developed a </v>

232
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 3>was to rescue the left from Stalinism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

233
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.630
<v Speaker 3>I still believed in this future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever,</v>

234
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>common government ownership of the means</v>

235
00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 3>of production and quality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

236
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I,</v>

237
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 3>I was a fervent new leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was one of the,</v>

238
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.230
<v Speaker 3>actually one of the creators of the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

239
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.793
<v Speaker 3>I was at Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We published a magazine called root and </v>

240
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.493
<v Speaker 3>branch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But by the end of that decade it was </v>

241
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.600
<v Speaker 3>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The left was a totalitarian forest.</v>

242
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.990
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't fit in with supporting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

243
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.580
<v Speaker 3>whatever was the men of malice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>malice.</v>

244
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 3>Mao killed more people in style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

245
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.283
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you saw that change from what you </v>

246
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.950
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something decent.</v>

247
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:21.784
<v Speaker 3>You saw that basically anything related </v>
<v Speaker 3>to authoritarianism would be sort of </v>

248
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 3>pieced into my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my most.</v>

249
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:28.923
<v Speaker 3>I had two serious deviations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a nuclear family and everybody </v>

250
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:35.530
<v Speaker 3>else was living in communities or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

251
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the more serious one was that I read</v>

252
00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:41.790
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

253
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.833
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when billy airs was elected </v>

254
00:13:46.481 --> 00:13:48.870
<v Speaker 3>vice president when the weather people </v>
<v Speaker 3>took over,</v>

255
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.480
<v Speaker 3>sds is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a college senior.</v>

256
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.450
<v Speaker 3>He boasted that he hadn't read a book in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year.</v>

257
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 3>I was horrified as a leftist by that </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement.</v>

258
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what was his argument was what?</v>

259
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:03.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm not being programmed by these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

260
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.850
<v Speaker 3>but then know to choose an irresponsible</v>
<v Speaker 3>twit.</v>

261
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:07.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

262
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came from wealth very privileged.</v>

263
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.243
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing good to say about billy </v>

264
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.653
<v Speaker 3>airs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by saying I haven't read a book in </v>

265
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:17.591
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is he?</v>

266
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:18.424
<v Speaker 3>How is he trying to impress somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know doing well because the books </v>

267
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 3>are written by the ruling class or when </v>
<v Speaker 3>a got.</v>

268
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.313
<v Speaker 3>What did mark say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The brulee ideas or the ideas of the </v>

269
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:30.910
<v Speaker 3>ruling class?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely false.</v>

270
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.240
<v Speaker 3>How would you explain our universities </v>
<v Speaker 3>today is full of crap.</v>

271
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.080
<v Speaker 3>I'd be the first thing yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

272
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Well we'll get to our universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about that.</v>

273
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.660
<v Speaker 3>But wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first one you mentioned there was,</v>

274
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:43.150
<v Speaker 3>you came from a nuclear family and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that a problem?</v>

275
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.910
<v Speaker 3>I had a nuclear fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

276
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had your own nuclear.</v>

277
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.930
<v Speaker 3>I also came from a new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite the end of the decade.</v>

278
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.150
<v Speaker 3>I had four children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

279
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why was that a problem for them?</v>

280
00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Because they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't,</v>

281
00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.360
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't expelled from the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

282
00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was um.</v>

283
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Well what happened to me was that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I edited ramparts,</v>

284
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.333
<v Speaker 3>which was the leading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the biggest magazine of the left </v>

285
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 3>and a Hollywood producer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>producer.</v>

286
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Vz Writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

287
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:20.890
<v Speaker 3>was a big funder and sponsor of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Black Panther party.</v>

288
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.380
<v Speaker 3>And He introduced me to Huey Newton </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he wanted me to take eldridge.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

290
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:30.643
<v Speaker 3>and eldridge there was a war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was basically a Black Panther party </v>

291
00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:37.100
<v Speaker 3>as a street gang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

292
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.300
<v Speaker 3>this was a contest for leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

293
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.060
<v Speaker 3>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

294
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.753
<v Speaker 3>he introduced me and I got to involve </v>
<v Speaker 3>raising money for the panthers I raised </v>

295
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.910
<v Speaker 3>per school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

296
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.833
<v Speaker 3>I was very impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a lot of children and the </v>

297
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.164
<v Speaker 3>Panther party was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were a genuinely good people and </v>

298
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:02.850
<v Speaker 3>they were gangsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

299
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.100
<v Speaker 3>and the good people impressed me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

300
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:06.973
<v Speaker 3>one of them was running the school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a school and they were jammed into a </v>

301
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 3>brown shingle house in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Oakland.</v>

302
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.813
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had double decker beds from one </v>

303
00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:22.880
<v Speaker 3>wall to the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the kids.</v>

304
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:25.150
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

305
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I thought this Hollywood producer would </v>
<v Speaker 3>give me the money but it didn't turn out</v>

306
00:16:29.841 --> 00:16:32.230
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I raised a,</v>

307
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.173
<v Speaker 3>I think it was $125,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which a lot of money in those days and </v>

308
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:36.944
<v Speaker 3>bought a church at Baptist Church in </v>
<v Speaker 3>East Oakland that had been overtaken by </v>

309
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:43.184
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

310
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.113
<v Speaker 3>inner city.</v>

311
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.150
<v Speaker 3>It was a white Baptist church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

312
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.760
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I signed up the check,</v>

313
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.030
<v Speaker 3>I created the Oakland community learning</v>
<v Speaker 3>center,</v>

314
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:55.790
<v Speaker 3>a five zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one c three to how's the school?</v>

315
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

316
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 3>the minister said to me as I handed him </v>
<v Speaker 3>the check,</v>

317
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:01.784
<v Speaker 3>I hope you're not going to turn this </v>
<v Speaker 3>over to the black panthers and the </v>

318
00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:06.794
<v Speaker 3>nation of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did he know that you were working </v>

319
00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:10.820
<v Speaker 3>with them at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the time?</v>

320
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:13.490
<v Speaker 3>That we had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was literally,</v>

321
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.460
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm talking to you like most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left today.</v>

322
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:18.800
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea who they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the panthers.</v>

323
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

324
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:25.250
<v Speaker 3>I've told this story in a radical son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my autobiography.</v>

325
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1974 I,</v>

326
00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:29.824
<v Speaker 3>I recruited the bookkeeper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my bookkeeper at ramparts to do the </v>

327
00:17:33.471 --> 00:17:34.304
<v Speaker 3>books for the school because I believed </v>
<v Speaker 3>our own propaganda that the government </v>

328
00:17:37.821 --> 00:17:38.654
<v Speaker 3>was racist and that they would shut down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the panthers if they didn't keep the </v>

329
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was ridiculous.</v>

330
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Jesse Jackson,</v>

331
00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:51.881
<v Speaker 3>look at Dale Sharpton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge tax evader yeah.</v>

332
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.333
<v Speaker 3>And he's walking the streets because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's progressive and Blackie's </v>

333
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.210
<v Speaker 3>protected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

334
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.340
<v Speaker 3>and in December 1974,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

335
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.243
<v Speaker 3>betty disappeared and by the time the </v>
<v Speaker 3>police Fisher body out of San Francisco </v>

336
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.310
<v Speaker 3>Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew the panthers had killed there and</v>

337
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 3>I had been interviewed by the police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They explained to me lots of things.</v>

338
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:12.564
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to high to dispose </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a body unless you have an </v>

339
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 3>organization and then it's not so hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have safe houses and this and that.</v>

340
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when that happened,</v>

341
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I was personally devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

342
00:18:28.761 --> 00:18:32.070
<v Speaker 3>I was in the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents were being embarrassed by the</v>

343
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:32.904
<v Speaker 3>Khrushchev report,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something I swore that I would never </v>

344
00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:37.550
<v Speaker 3>happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

345
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.350
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious,</v>

346
00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:41.700
<v Speaker 3>what were your parents around at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>

347
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother was very,</v>

348
00:18:43.051 --> 00:18:45.690
<v Speaker 3>they were worried for my safety as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be.</v>

349
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:46.523
<v Speaker 3>I was threatened by Elaine Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the head of the panthers and is </v>

350
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:51.114
<v Speaker 3>alive today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a toasted by the Atlanta journal </v>

351
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

352
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.433
<v Speaker 3>funded by actually conservatives have </v>
<v Speaker 3>often not always speak on college </v>

353
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:05.520
<v Speaker 3>campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

354
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.383
<v Speaker 3>she was the head of the party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would conservatives phoned her now </v>

355
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 3>as she evolved?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd forget that.</v>

356
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.160
<v Speaker 3>What's the name of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big orange county foundation.</v>

357
00:19:14.161 --> 00:19:17.610
<v Speaker 3>They gave her $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to speak and uh,</v>

358
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.070
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was UC Santa Barbara.</v>

359
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.840
<v Speaker 3>I with the students there and informed </v>
<v Speaker 3>the now because,</v>

360
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:26.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

361
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.023
<v Speaker 3>conservatives in this country are a well</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning a liberal minded people </v>

362
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 3>generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the ones with money.</v>

363
00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

364
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:41.880
<v Speaker 3>here's a black person claiming that </v>
<v Speaker 3>America is an oppressive country.</v>

365
00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:46.881
<v Speaker 3>All sure he has money anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

366
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.640
<v Speaker 3>I was personally devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was clinically,</v>

367
00:19:53.641 --> 00:19:54.474
<v Speaker 3>I would say clinically depressed for </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven or eight years where I wake up in </v>

368
00:19:58.621 --> 00:19:59.454
<v Speaker 3>tears every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt responsible for having recruited </v>

369
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.070
<v Speaker 3>betty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

370
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 3>my name is Betty van patter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The woman who was murdered.</v>

371
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.733
<v Speaker 3>She was a mother of three children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the etiology is so precious that on </v>

372
00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:15.144
<v Speaker 3>the way to betty's funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her daughter who worked for me and I </v>

373
00:20:19.391 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 3>didn't know if she was 19 or 20 at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

374
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.690
<v Speaker 3>I tried to warn her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

375
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.260
<v Speaker 3>I was afraid for my children and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the panthers killed your mother.</v>

376
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.840
<v Speaker 3>And her response was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

377
00:20:30.841 --> 00:20:31.710
<v Speaker 3>they're good people.</v>

378
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.733
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I set out then to warn when I had </v>

379
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.580
<v Speaker 3>sort of assimilated all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

380
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:44.683
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mission was to warn other people and </v>

381
00:20:48.191 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 3>that's how I know that Barack Obama is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>communist.</v>

382
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:52.021
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wait,</v>

383
00:20:52.021 --> 00:20:54.780
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's pause before we jump to modern day</v>

384
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.943
<v Speaker 2>because everything that you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>described there was why I thought your </v>

385
00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.170
<v Speaker 2>bio is so interesting because you grow </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with communists,</v>

386
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I didn't know about the.</v>

387
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.033
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about the guy in the </v>

388
00:21:03.751 --> 00:21:04.270
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>

389
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

390
00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:05.664
<v Speaker 2>you are firmly on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your whole first 40 some ideas with </v>

391
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:09.923
<v Speaker 2>Maurice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book called Empire in </v>

392
00:21:11.011 --> 00:21:12.870
<v Speaker 2>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the left used,</v>

393
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So leftist,</v>

394
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Communist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxist.</v>

395
00:21:16.351 --> 00:21:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so bourbon for example,</v>

396
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>set of the,</v>

397
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.760
<v Speaker 3>of my book that it was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he said,</v>

398
00:21:25.761 --> 00:21:27.870
<v Speaker 3>a handbook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Bible for the,</v>

399
00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.053
<v Speaker 3>for the left before I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he called me a renegade for leaving the </v>

400
00:21:33.741 --> 00:21:34.110
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

401
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.921
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

402
00:21:34.921 --> 00:21:36.190
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

403
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:39.540
<v Speaker 2>you're a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the second you now change.</v>

404
00:21:39.541 --> 00:21:40.141
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

405
00:21:40.141 --> 00:21:40.974
<v Speaker 2>if you deviate from the party line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what political people don't </v>

406
00:21:44.611 --> 00:21:46.140
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political correctness is</v>

407
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.083
<v Speaker 3>turn that Mousey tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest mass murder in human </v>

408
00:21:49.131 --> 00:21:53.420
<v Speaker 3>history and vented to shut people up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the party line.</v>

409
00:21:53.421 --> 00:21:56.690
<v Speaker 3>If you deviate from the party line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they throw you into the cold.</v>

410
00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:57.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

411
00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we're,</v>

412
00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.013
<v Speaker 2>let's flash forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless there's something that shoot you </v>

413
00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.780
<v Speaker 2>or shoot you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

414
00:22:02.781 --> 00:22:05.080
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they silence you,</v>

415
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.240
<v Speaker 2>then they shoot you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

416
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so unless I'm missing something,</v>

417
00:22:08.571 --> 00:22:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I think we can flash forward now to </v>
<v Speaker 2>around 85,</v>

418
00:22:10.791 --> 00:22:13.460
<v Speaker 2>which is really when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

419
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.100
<v Speaker 2>what happened was when this happened,</v>

420
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was writing,</v>

421
00:22:17.551 --> 00:22:18.430
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>

422
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left ramparts with Peter Collier who was</v>

423
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.690
<v Speaker 3>by buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

424
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was Peter's idea that to write a,</v>

425
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.260
<v Speaker 3>a dynastic biography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

426
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.660
<v Speaker 3>the goals were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the saga was on pbs at the time,</v>

427
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.633
<v Speaker 3>so it was a generational saga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was in the midst of writing a book </v>

428
00:22:44.201 --> 00:22:46.780
<v Speaker 3>on the rockefellers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which became a best seller.</v>

429
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.650
<v Speaker 3>And then we were asked to do a book on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Kennedys,</v>

430
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:56.430
<v Speaker 3>which came out in 1985.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

431
00:22:56.471 --> 00:22:57.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 19 eight and,</v>

432
00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:58.683
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

433
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it came out it was a number one New</v>

434
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:06.560
<v Speaker 3>York Times bestseller and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Washington Post,</v>

435
00:23:06.561 --> 00:23:07.394
<v Speaker 3>the editor of The Washington Post Sunday</v>
<v Speaker 3>magazine called me to pick my brain </v>

436
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 3>about young Joe Kennedy was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>congressman and he said,</v>

437
00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:18.020
<v Speaker 3>what have you guys been doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our whole,</v>

438
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't believe this,</v>

439
00:23:19.571 --> 00:23:20.404
<v Speaker 3>but Peter and I just voted for Ronald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Reagan and neither Peter and I had </v>

440
00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:25.690
<v Speaker 3>talked before casting that vote.</v>

441
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.010
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

442
00:23:27.011 --> 00:23:28.840
<v Speaker 3>that's a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to write it?</v>

443
00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:33.841
<v Speaker 3>So our story was better run than red,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he renamed it lefties for Reagan.</v>

444
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:34.743
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then that's when the knives came out </v>

445
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.880
<v Speaker 3>and Peter said to me at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just show you how deep the current rot</v>

446
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.080
<v Speaker 3>the fake news is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

447
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.173
<v Speaker 3>we were front page New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both books about the rockefellers and </v>

448
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Sunday Times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And The New York Times sets the standard</v>

449
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:58.780
<v Speaker 3>for all the media they even reprint </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

450
00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.200
<v Speaker 3>May View is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

451
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 3>and when our article came back on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we voted for Reagan.</v>

452
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Peter said to me are literary careers </v>
<v Speaker 3>are over.</v>

453
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

454
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:15.770
<v Speaker 3>So you must be joking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you really had no idea.</v>

455
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:16.604
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though you knew some of the </v>

456
00:24:18.801 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 3>tactics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was exactly right.</v>

457
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.140
<v Speaker 3>That was the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't lie less 20 bucks.</v>

458
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm a New York Times.</v>

459
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.110
<v Speaker 3>They noticed one and called me a relic </v>
<v Speaker 3>for using the word Communist.</v>

460
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.830
<v Speaker 3>That was just a squib.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

461
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.693
<v Speaker 3>So even though you knew all the tactics </v>
<v Speaker 3>that could be coming down on your way </v>

462
00:24:37.641 --> 00:24:40.330
<v Speaker 3>and the way you be treated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever been a realist about that then.</v>

463
00:24:40.331 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 3>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's it.</v>

464
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:42.404
<v Speaker 3>You just weren't a realist and your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though you saw you had such a </v>

465
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:45.854
<v Speaker 3>history of seeing what would happen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not the hare instant cognitivism black </v>

466
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.980
<v Speaker 3>could never believe that people can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>so ideological and so duped and I should</v>

467
00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:55.911
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

468
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I think I've been suffering from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little of this right now and immediate.</v>

469
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.920
<v Speaker 3>The rubber's meeting the road with me at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment of of this kind of what,</v>

470
00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.013
<v Speaker 3>but what was it about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it something about Reagan or was it </v>

471
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:08.460
<v Speaker 3>really about Mondelez?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reagan was.</v>

472
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:09.663
<v Speaker 3>This happened earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My bumped in to the parking lot of the </v>

473
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.383
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley Co op,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a supermarket that was </v>

474
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 3>everybody liked because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperative.</v>

475
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not rolling stone actually publish</v>

476
00:25:25.171 --> 00:25:27.320
<v Speaker 3>a story that Peter and I did on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weather,</v>

477
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.620
<v Speaker 3>the weather underground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth about it.</v>

478
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

479
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 3>this woman I knew that me and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>parking lot and she said,</v>

480
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:37.761
<v Speaker 3>David,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

481
00:25:37.761 --> 00:25:39.170
<v Speaker 3>people really hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

482
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.250
<v Speaker 3>The truth about these crazy terrorists </v>
<v Speaker 3>is what they were,</v>

483
00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 3>who got people killed and they hate you </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

484
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 3>Hey me for saying the truth about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

485
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:55.663
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what was it about Reagan also that </v>

486
00:25:57.261 --> 00:25:59.330
<v Speaker 3>then they hated Reagan the way they hate</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

487
00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the same kind of hatred.</v>

488
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.600
<v Speaker 3>That ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just hate it.</v>

489
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.420
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because he's,</v>

490
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.740
<v Speaker 3>he's not one of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

491
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.500
<v Speaker 3>it's very visceral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

492
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.740
<v Speaker 3>Is that what anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ironically,</v>

493
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not one of them,</v>

494
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:16.780
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

495
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.613
<v Speaker 3>he was an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't know the trump phenomenon and </v>

496
00:26:24.531 --> 00:26:28.310
<v Speaker 3>problem is a little different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not all that different.</v>

497
00:26:28.311 --> 00:26:29.144
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reagan was an actor that they looked </v>

498
00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 3>down on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

499
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fun,</v>

500
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.300
<v Speaker 3>wrote a pamphlet called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

501
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.380
<v Speaker 3>an essay which is a pamphlet called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti capitalist mentality.</v>

502
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:49.460
<v Speaker 3>Why do academics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he capitalism,</v>

503
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.000
<v Speaker 3>why are they so left?</v>

504
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.680
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is because they feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>superior to businessmen.</v>

505
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.240
<v Speaker 3>And here's trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The businessman.</v>

506
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.320
<v Speaker 3>A businessman are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

507
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 3>they have no respect for what it takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to build a billion dollar empire of,</v>

508
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.840
<v Speaker 3>for them it's all theft or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>underhanded.</v>

509
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.040
<v Speaker 3>It's after it's crony capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're.</v>

510
00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 3>So Reagan was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an actor.</v>

511
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.210
<v Speaker 3>How dare he be present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're so much smarter than he is.</v>

512
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 3>We should be running the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So intellectual stat,</v>

513
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it was about intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's generally they don't,</v>

514
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.513
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel that they're smarter than </v>

515
00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:30.600
<v Speaker 3>everybody else because they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually created for the most part.</v>

516
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:32.990
<v Speaker 3>So they have to sort of elevate what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pad.</v>

517
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.833
<v Speaker 3>I think the power should go to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I learned very early when I was </v>

518
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:37.944
<v Speaker 3>still leftist when Jack Kennedy was </v>
<v Speaker 3>assassinated and Lyndon Johnson became </v>

519
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:43.164
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was living in England and of course </v>

520
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Europeans looked at on an Americans from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of the republic,</v>

521
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.590
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

522
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.333
<v Speaker 3>Lbj,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had the Lbj cufflinks and the Lbj </v>

523
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 3>children and the Lbj dogs and the MPG.</v>

524
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.690
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just thought he was.</v>

525
00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:04.540
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

526
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:05.600
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

527
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:06.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

528
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.143
<v Speaker 3>and Johnson was much smarter than Jack </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy and he went to East Texas State </v>

529
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Teachers College,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

530
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.830
<v Speaker 3>he unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he put in place the great society,</v>

531
00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:24.831
<v Speaker 3>which is an Albatross on America's neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been for lo these this half century.</v>

532
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:28.883
<v Speaker 3>But he was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew how to get it through Congress </v>

533
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:34.050
<v Speaker 3>and Jack Kennedy couldn't get any of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

534
00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I now congress barely worked.</v>

535
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:37.074
<v Speaker 3>So that's why when trump came along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't one of these never trumping </v>

536
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.590
<v Speaker 3>inside the beltway snobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although some of my,</v>

537
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.350
<v Speaker 3>my good friends from path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

538
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:52.470
<v Speaker 3>so you have this final awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You write this thing.</v>

539
00:28:52.471 --> 00:28:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Then a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in [inaudible] 86 year old,</v>

540
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:56.880
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't why I left the left.</v>

541
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.280
<v Speaker 3>I wrote it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

542
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:00.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I say,</v>

543
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.530
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

544
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:02.363
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was personally threatened by Elaine </v>

545
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Brown.</v>

546
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then in a,</v>

547
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.580
<v Speaker 3>I have a tape of the phone conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>was he said,</v>

548
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.390
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you should get run over David,</v>

549
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.950
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

550
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be your best friend because</v>

551
00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:22.080
<v Speaker 3>people will say I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

552
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a threat.</v>

553
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:29.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was afraid I fed to Kate Coleman,</v>

554
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.230
<v Speaker 3>who wrote an article for a now defunct </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftwing magazine,</v>

555
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's called the party's over about the</v>

556
00:29:37.981 --> 00:29:38.814
<v Speaker 3>criminality of the panthers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I had discovered by personal </v>

557
00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:44.090
<v Speaker 3>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

558
00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

559
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.713
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot.</v>

560
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting to the village voice piece,</v>

561
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.050
<v Speaker 3>the village voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

562
00:29:54.051 --> 00:29:57.020
<v Speaker 3>So I finally in 1986,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

563
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.740
<v Speaker 3>it's a decade later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a piece why I am not no longer a</v>

564
00:30:02.741 --> 00:30:05.200
<v Speaker 3>leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

565
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.340
<v Speaker 3>and we've heard to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not name the killers,</v>

566
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:14.110
<v Speaker 3>but I did refer to the murder and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>path that the panthers and murdered her.</v>

567
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.753
<v Speaker 3>And I'm a poem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Berman wrote this piece about the </v>

568
00:30:21.491 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 3>renegade Horowitz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intellectual life,</v>

569
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:24.574
<v Speaker 3>and the renegade Horowitz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a vicious attack and he had me </v>

570
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:31.580
<v Speaker 3>at the end of his piece cheering on </v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide.</v>

571
00:30:31.581 --> 00:30:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Sita,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a psychopath.</v>

572
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.593
<v Speaker 3>That was a contract in Nicaragua who </v>
<v Speaker 3>might hadn't even heard of when he </v>

573
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:39.543
<v Speaker 3>called me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said in Horowitz's cheering wakes up </v>

574
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:42.543
<v Speaker 3>the next morning cheering suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically you went off the </v>

575
00:30:45.281 --> 00:30:46.114
<v Speaker 3>reservation officially with this article</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you had said the knives were </v>

576
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.413
<v Speaker 3>already out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll know it was with the Reagan </v>

577
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:56.101
<v Speaker 3>article with the Reagan article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why this is a right and left.</v>

578
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was a way.</v>

579
00:30:57.941 --> 00:30:58.900
<v Speaker 3>He was a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

580
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 85 and 86,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a year later.</v>

581
00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:04.390
<v Speaker 3>So the knives were already out and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>this was like sort of the final door on.</v>

582
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I saw 1986,</v>

583
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.120
<v Speaker 3>87.</v>

584
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.130
<v Speaker 3>That's 30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

585
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:14.131
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 30 years my work has never been taken</v>

586
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.400
<v Speaker 3>the work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideas,</v>

587
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.980
<v Speaker 3>my arguments with the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am no law?</v>

588
00:31:19.981 --> 00:31:24.160
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a long essay on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on leaving the left,</v>

589
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:29.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and why I left it a never responded to.</v>

590
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm the nation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made one stab at it,</v>

591
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.063
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not a very good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand is like hundred </v>

592
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.570
<v Speaker 3>thousand attacks on me on the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>from leftists.</v>

593
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.410
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like they don't think that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to be refuted anything.</v>

594
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.600
<v Speaker 3>It's just more effective to pretending </v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes you feel any better.</v>

595
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Right before we sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was scrolling my twitter feed and some</v>

596
00:31:52.271 --> 00:31:53.104
<v Speaker 3>article was written about me were they </v>
<v Speaker 3>referred to me as a right winger and </v>

597
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:55.984
<v Speaker 3>then got a few other things incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 3>about me and then my own audience </v>

598
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.080
<v Speaker 3>actually started attacking them on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter and then they,</v>

599
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.273
<v Speaker 3>they didn't issue a retraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they changed the headline at least </v>

600
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:06.214
<v Speaker 3>and change one other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course is not journalistically </v>

601
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.100
<v Speaker 3>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess maybe I'm picking up some of</v>

602
00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:12.600
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

603
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Well at first it hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but eventually you get to be liable.</v>

604
00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:17.314
<v Speaker 3>Proof thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They libel used so much that it just </v>

605
00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:21.640
<v Speaker 3>seems ridiculous more than anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

606
00:32:21.641 --> 00:32:23.640
<v Speaker 3>It's just lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lazy and ridiculous.</v>

607
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:24.973
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an easier target than you are </v>

608
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:31.460
<v Speaker 3>because I vowed when I left the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm gonna talk to the left.</v>

609
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Address them in the same way that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>addressed everybody else.</v>

610
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:35.870
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

611
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know you could have nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

612
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:42.740
<v Speaker 3>You and barry very hard to demonize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of easy.</v>

613
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:47.240
<v Speaker 3>So when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had some nice things to say about me</v>

614
00:32:47.241 --> 00:32:48.074
<v Speaker 3>when you sat down and when you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone like me that's understands the </v>

615
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:51.734
<v Speaker 3>title of this book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that understands your journey and all </v>

616
00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:55.550
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think I was just.</v>

617
00:32:55.551 --> 00:32:56.384
<v Speaker 3>Even though I'm obviously are we have 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>some odd years between us that I was </v>

618
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:01.850
<v Speaker 3>just late to the game and picking up </v>
<v Speaker 3>what was going on here?</v>

619
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:02.683
<v Speaker 3>Or do you think something also happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the last couple of years with the </v>

620
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.513
<v Speaker 3>left?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

621
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.910
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting with the mcgovern campaign.</v>

622
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:14.210
<v Speaker 3>That's when it started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The communists left,</v>

623
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.360
<v Speaker 3>infiltrated and took over the Democratic</v>
<v Speaker 3>Party.</v>

624
00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Tom Hayden was no longer with us,</v>

625
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:28.390
<v Speaker 3>was a cynical and I am American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lying radical.</v>

626
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was given the medal of freedom by</v>

627
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:34.640
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

628
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:35.853
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a state legislator in the state </v>

629
00:33:39.171 --> 00:33:40.004
<v Speaker 3>of California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can still see his work whenever you </v>

630
00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:47.321
<v Speaker 3>see prop 65 that warns you about the bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>effects of chemicals in your whatever.</v>

631
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's everywhere here in la.</v>

632
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.083
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Democratic Party took the left </v>

633
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.100
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ana,</v>

634
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.790
<v Speaker 3>the Nih,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American totalitarian,</v>

635
00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.790
<v Speaker 3>and I would say racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Left.</v>

636
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.380
<v Speaker 3>I will explain that later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But racist left was taken into the bosom</v>

637
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:12.530
<v Speaker 3>of the Democratic Party in the Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration.</v>

638
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.233
<v Speaker 3>And with Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got one of theirs in the White </v>

639
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:17.221
<v Speaker 3>House.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

640
00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:18.650
<v Speaker 3>So let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's pause there for a second.</v>

641
00:34:18.651 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 3>So when I hear you said about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton administration,</v>

642
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 3>that's hard for me to picture because </v>
<v Speaker 3>those eight years were basically,</v>

643
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we saw a lot of what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing right now.</v>

644
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:31.190
<v Speaker 3>So what am I missing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you miss them?</v>

645
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.510
<v Speaker 3>You didn't know the personalities from </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

646
00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've written a,</v>

647
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:38.923
<v Speaker 3>let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think back to the Clinton </v>

648
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.760
<v Speaker 3>administration very fondly still that </v>
<v Speaker 3>things were basically,</v>

649
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.360
<v Speaker 3>there were terrible that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>basic.</v>

650
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton's was not an idiot log in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that Hillary Clinton,</v>

651
00:34:50.781 --> 00:34:55.781
<v Speaker 3>this Bill Clinton's etiology was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why was this ideology and was.</v>

652
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.730
<v Speaker 3>But that you would argue that's probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>a saving grace.</v>

653
00:34:58.731 --> 00:35:01.790
<v Speaker 3>Then corruption is far better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>communism.</v>

654
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

655
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.680
<v Speaker 3>If it burned for the corruption of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Clintons,</v>

656
00:35:06.681 --> 00:35:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders would have been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nominee.</v>

657
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a great quote there.</v>

658
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.233
<v Speaker 3>You just go out corruption as far better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than communism as a good way because it </v>

659
00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:17.720
<v Speaker 3>is because you've got a meeting that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can deal with.</v>

660
00:35:17.721 --> 00:35:18.554
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have the ideology that sweeps</v>
<v Speaker 3>people along with Bill Clinton </v>

661
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:22.910
<v Speaker 3>domestically was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

662
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 3>a fairly centrist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

663
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:25.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have too much to quarrel with </v>

664
00:35:27.351 --> 00:35:28.730
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

665
00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:29.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

666
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm foreign policy was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely terrible.</v>

667
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:38.830
<v Speaker 3>The World Trade Center was blown up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>1993 a by Ramzi Yousef.</v>

668
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:45.060
<v Speaker 3>He intended to kill 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people or $200,000,</v>

669
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.970
<v Speaker 3>top of one of the towers on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bomb is fired.</v>

670
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.270
<v Speaker 3>It wounded a thousand people and killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>six.</v>

671
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.613
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton never visited the site,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dismissed it as an individual criminal </v>

672
00:35:57.031 --> 00:36:00.450
<v Speaker 3>act when it was inspired by the blind </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheikh who's just been,</v>

673
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assignment been London.</v>

674
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.083
<v Speaker 3>We should have been stopped in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties before the World Trade Center </v>

675
00:36:08.881 --> 00:36:09.830
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

676
00:36:09.831 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 3>I can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've written a lot about this.</v>

677
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.733
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the case of that in case the </v>

678
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.940
<v Speaker 3>first World Trade Center bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think was going on?</v>

679
00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 3>They didn't Bill Clinton's head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this happens.</v>

680
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:21.710
<v Speaker 3>He never visited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say what is the,</v>

681
00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.570
<v Speaker 3>what's the ideology there that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>lead him to that?</v>

682
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.433
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish we had a one of these Democrats </v>

683
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:33.010
<v Speaker 3>on and you could ask them the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

684
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:34.003
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to get a former just to skip </v>

685
00:36:37.051 --> 00:36:40.890
<v Speaker 3>ahead in this book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've written big agenda.</v>

686
00:36:40.891 --> 00:36:44.430
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lay out what I think is going on that,</v>

687
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:45.463
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

688
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.330
<v Speaker 3>the Democratic Party is now a racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>party.</v>

689
00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:53.640
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you used the phrase people of color is a</v>

690
00:36:53.641 --> 00:36:54.474
<v Speaker 3>racist phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Identity politics is racist and it's </v>

691
00:36:57.301 --> 00:36:58.134
<v Speaker 3>anti American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fundamental American idea is that </v>

692
00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:07.671
<v Speaker 3>we're all creatures of a divinity or </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe nature's God,</v>

693
00:37:08.041 --> 00:37:13.041
<v Speaker 3>whatever Jefferson wrote there and equal</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the eyes of our creator.</v>

694
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.263
<v Speaker 3>Therefore we should be treated equally </v>
<v Speaker 3>by our government and we have rights </v>

695
00:37:19.351 --> 00:37:23.310
<v Speaker 3>that are inalienable at government can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>take away.</v>

696
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 3>So it's all about individual freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most importantly,</v>

697
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:33.321
<v Speaker 3>individual accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid in public schools,</v>

698
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 3>we always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this phrase,</v>

699
00:37:38.161 --> 00:37:40.050
<v Speaker 3>regardless of race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>color,</v>

700
00:37:40.051 --> 00:37:40.884
<v Speaker 3>or creed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who an American is somebody who doesn't </v>

701
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 3>look at your origins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're a nation of immigrants that way.</v>

702
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Don't look at your origins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

703
00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:55.701
<v Speaker 3>if you come from a terrorist country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should have a little vetting process.</v>

704
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity politics is the opposite.</v>

705
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 3>What the left seeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are in a civil war situation now.</v>

706
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:10.763
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason is the reason it's so </v>

707
00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:13.734
<v Speaker 3>irreconcilable is that the left believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a racist that believes in a racial </v>

708
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:21.690
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're the right skin color,</v>

709
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:22.524
<v Speaker 3>which is dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to the head of the line for </v>

710
00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:27.000
<v Speaker 3>admissions to college and go to the head</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the line for job.</v>

711
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 3>You go to the headline for our </v>
<v Speaker 3>promotion,</v>

712
00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:30.163
<v Speaker 3>you go to the head of the line for </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost anything and everything's not </v>

713
00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:35.160
<v Speaker 3>diverse enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll take.</v>

714
00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what would you say to the people that</v>

715
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:39.004
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

716
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.000
<v Speaker 3>white people had a good for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

717
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.030
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and why?</v>

718
00:38:42.031 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 3>People do bad things and they did good </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

719
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:49.270
<v Speaker 3>And one of the good things that White </v>
<v Speaker 3>America did was to liberate the slaves.</v>

720
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:54.540
<v Speaker 3>People forget that we inherited slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how I've been myself,</v>

721
00:38:55.001 --> 00:38:55.834
<v Speaker 3>notorious in the left by coming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>against reparations for slavery a 137 </v>

722
00:39:00.251 --> 00:39:03.280
<v Speaker 3>years after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

723
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.270
<v Speaker 3>America inherited a system of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slavery existed.</v>

724
00:39:07.271 --> 00:39:11.110
<v Speaker 3>I learned this from Orlando Patterson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is a black left of center,</v>

725
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.863
<v Speaker 3>a sociologist at Harvard who's written </v>
<v Speaker 3>prize winning books on slavery and </v>

726
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:22.030
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slavery existed for 3000 years.</v>

727
00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Nobody ever said it was a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Jesus,</v>

728
00:39:24.731 --> 00:39:25.564
<v Speaker 3>not Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not aristotle until a white Christian </v>

729
00:39:30.071 --> 00:39:30.904
<v Speaker 3>males in England led by Wilberforce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said it's a moral and an American slave </v>

730
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 3>owner.</v>

731
00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:41.460
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Jefferson wrote it into the birth</v>
<v Speaker 3>certificate of this country that all men</v>

732
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:46.210
<v Speaker 3>are created equal and a given right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberty by their creator.</v>

733
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Within 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the slave trade was ended.</v>

734
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.733
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that America didn't initiate </v>

735
00:39:54.461 --> 00:39:55.294
<v Speaker 3>a civil war in 1776 to free the slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the biggest reasons was that </v>

736
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.530
<v Speaker 3>England would have come and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we take in the colonies and reinstituted</v>

737
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.390
<v Speaker 3>a slavery anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and within a generation or a little more</v>

738
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 3>given in those days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people live shorter lives,</v>

739
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the cost of a 350,000</v>

740
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:18.274
<v Speaker 3>union soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We the braid that the slaves and </v>

741
00:40:20.171 --> 00:40:22.330
<v Speaker 3>liberated them throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere.</v>

742
00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:23.943
<v Speaker 3>So black people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans can be very proud of their </v>

743
00:40:27.821 --> 00:40:29.080
<v Speaker 3>heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

744
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

745
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.400
<v Speaker 3>it's a human heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's got a lot of bad spots,</v>

746
00:40:33.401 --> 00:40:35.650
<v Speaker 3>but you look at any other country in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

747
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.050
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forgive me,</v>

748
00:40:38.051 --> 00:40:41.500
<v Speaker 3>left this for saying this one thing nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>about America is the best.</v>

749
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:47.940
<v Speaker 3>What other country do Asians get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>boats and risk their lives to get into?</v>

750
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.170
<v Speaker 3>You think that coming here to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressed,</v>

751
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody,</v>

752
00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:54.750
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the funny thing is this,</v>

753
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.593
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to watch some of these protests </v>

754
00:40:57.311 --> 00:40:58.144
<v Speaker 3>and the people that are screaming about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how racist and evil and patriarchy and </v>

755
00:41:00.881 --> 00:41:01.714
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're also the ones calling for open </v>

756
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:04.580
<v Speaker 3>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want everyone to share in the heart</v>

757
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.433
<v Speaker 3>that is to destroy the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody with any sense knows so had it </v>

758
00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.390
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let me just say,</v>

759
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left is,</v>

760
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.750
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's own.</v>

761
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.823
<v Speaker 3>Whatever ideas it has to marks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the Marxist paradigm of the </v>

762
00:41:21.611 --> 00:41:25.240
<v Speaker 3>oppressors and the oppressed and it's an</v>
<v Speaker 3>economic.</v>

763
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:29.320
<v Speaker 3>It begins as an economic and they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>layered on race and gender.</v>

764
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:30.873
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the fact is determines a country's </v>

765
00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 3>prosperity is culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not classes.</v>

766
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.050
<v Speaker 3>It's culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>America has a great culture.</v>

767
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.050
<v Speaker 3>We take in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

768
00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.990
<v Speaker 3>One of the things we do is we take in </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant people from all over the world</v>

769
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.640
<v Speaker 3>and give them freedom to innovate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other countries,</v>

770
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:55.670
<v Speaker 3>copy our innovations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Israel is the same way.</v>

771
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:56.504
<v Speaker 3>It's why they hate it because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing in people from all over the </v>

772
00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:01.443
<v Speaker 3>windows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also it's the freedom people do not </v>

773
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:08.090
<v Speaker 3>appreciate freedom in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

774
00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:12.230
<v Speaker 3>since we are universities and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian institutions,</v>

775
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:15.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't go to a university without </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodyguards.</v>

776
00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:15.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's been true for the last 15 </v>

777
00:42:19.431 --> 00:42:20.264
<v Speaker 3>years I've been physically attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I didn't have bodyguards and if the </v>

778
00:42:23.961 --> 00:42:24.794
<v Speaker 3>university has put in place security,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could never get through a speech and </v>

779
00:42:28.581 --> 00:42:30.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm not alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's any conservative,</v>

780
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.083
<v Speaker 3>virtually any conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now it's moderates and this is </v>

781
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:35.414
<v Speaker 3>fascism and that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally embedded in our university </v>

782
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

783
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you make a distinction between sort </v>

784
00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:45.350
<v Speaker 3>of the leaders who really understand the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that you're talking about?</v>

785
00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:46.184
<v Speaker 3>So the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are the leaders of this leftist </v>

786
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:49.603
<v Speaker 3>movement versus the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bulk of the people who I think are </v>

787
00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.410
<v Speaker 3>following along without bad intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I see all these kids who I,</v>

788
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:58.363
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lock them on twitter and people got a </v>

789
00:42:59.631 --> 00:43:01.520
<v Speaker 3>demonstration to get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

790
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

791
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:06.170
<v Speaker 3>and people are gullible and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

792
00:43:06.171 --> 00:43:11.171
<v Speaker 3>And I can't put two and two together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The phrase I didn't want to skip this.</v>

793
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:17.140
<v Speaker 3>People of color is a racist phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not English.</v>

794
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.233
<v Speaker 3>Do we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a box of crayons of color and </v>

795
00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:27.200
<v Speaker 3>French.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way French people or color or</v>

796
00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:28.580
<v Speaker 3>whatever they say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

797
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 3>So it's a completely ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>construct.</v>

798
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 3>So is that as its function?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

799
00:43:34.821 --> 00:43:36.680
<v Speaker 3>let's look at the Mexico.</v>

800
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:37.933
<v Speaker 3>Two main ethnic groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The descendants of the Spanish </v>

801
00:43:42.021 --> 00:43:42.854
<v Speaker 3>conquistadores who slaughtered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>indigenous Indians and the descendants </v>

802
00:43:45.771 --> 00:43:49.100
<v Speaker 3>of the indigenous Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they crossed the border,</v>

803
00:43:49.101 --> 00:43:51.620
<v Speaker 3>they both people of color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore they're oppressed.</v>

804
00:43:51.621 --> 00:43:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The keys,</v>

805
00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:56.870
<v Speaker 3>the doors and the indigenous people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are oppressed.</v>

806
00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:00.920
<v Speaker 3>They deserve special sensitivities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>special privileges.</v>

807
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:02.023
<v Speaker 3>Maharajahs in India are people of color </v>
<v Speaker 3>be headers in Rocca are people of color </v>

808
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:11.480
<v Speaker 3>who are people of color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white people,</v>

809
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.750
<v Speaker 3>white people are evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

810
00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.490
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

811
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:16.363
<v Speaker 3>this is the racist ideology of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it also lacking in several other </v>

812
00:44:21.621 --> 00:44:22.041
<v Speaker 3>ways?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

813
00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:25.040
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could take American Indians,</v>

814
00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:26.043
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who've moved here from India or </v>

815
00:44:27.051 --> 00:44:28.550
<v Speaker 3>their grandparents moved here from </v>
<v Speaker 3>India,</v>

816
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.220
<v Speaker 3>or you could take Asian people at </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually any nationality</v>

817
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.310
<v Speaker 2>and they don't count in this leftist </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because they've said,</v>

818
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Indians happened.</v>

819
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The native Americans.</v>

820
00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

821
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to,</v>

822
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to edit that out because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in that,</v>

823
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:48.060
<v Speaker 2>but that was in the completely idiotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>

824
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I American Indians from India who moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>to America.</v>

825
00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:54.450
<v Speaker 2>That's what native American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

826
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

827
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:56.663
<v Speaker 2>Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese and American Indians in </v>

828
00:44:58.011 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 2>that native American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

829
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just ruined my list.</v>

830
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to say says my Nora.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

831
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.060
<v Speaker 2>don't look over your shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only,</v>

832
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 2>there's only arrows coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was Indian joke right there.</v>

833
00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left.</v>

834
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.760
<v Speaker 3>It's pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Intellectually.</v>

835
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:21.653
<v Speaker 3>They don't have an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have to purge those groups </v>

836
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.350
<v Speaker 3>because those groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

837
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:26.223
<v Speaker 3>That's why they have to shut you up </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they can't deal with your </v>

838
00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 3>arguments is really simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straightforward,</v>

839
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.690
<v Speaker 3>and it's so invaded our literary </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

840
00:45:33.691 --> 00:45:37.920
<v Speaker 3>The last two national book awards were </v>
<v Speaker 3>given to racist tracks,</v>

841
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.610
<v Speaker 3>one by Ta-nehisi coats I can never </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember.</v>

842
00:45:41.611 --> 00:45:46.611
<v Speaker 3>The title of it was just a rank racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>coats.</v>

843
00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what inspired him to write the book?</v>

844
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:55.791
<v Speaker 3>It's about how evil America is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how was the murder of his friend?</v>

845
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:56.933
<v Speaker 3>Not The bird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I the killing of his friend by a </v>

846
00:45:59.341 --> 00:46:00.174
<v Speaker 3>policeman in Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns out as he tells you that the </v>

847
00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:08.310
<v Speaker 3>policemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the policemen accused the dead,</v>

848
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.970
<v Speaker 3>his dead friend of trying to run him </v>
<v Speaker 3>over with his car.</v>

849
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.100
<v Speaker 3>The policeman is black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does code say?</v>

850
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.053
<v Speaker 3>He was thinking white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that isn't the purest racism and </v>

851
00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:25.290
<v Speaker 3>this one now it's called stamped from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning.</v>

852
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:28.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a semi illiterate book that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it,</v>

853
00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.673
<v Speaker 3>that they have lowered their standards </v>
<v Speaker 3>so dramatically as a still shocks me </v>

854
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.640
<v Speaker 3>because these are intelligent people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people give the awards,</v>

855
00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:40.640
<v Speaker 3>but I should know better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

856
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.460
<v Speaker 3>but it opens with the police shootings </v>
<v Speaker 3>of criminals in the last year,</v>

857
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.073
<v Speaker 3>which were totally distorted by black </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives matter and other leftists into a </v>

858
00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:58.410
<v Speaker 3>cops gutting down unarmed blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These were predators.</v>

859
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 3>And who did they pray?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pray on a braid on black people.</v>

860
00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Freddie Gray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

861
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:06.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could go on a,</v>

862
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:08.130
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even remember the names,</v>

863
00:47:08.131 --> 00:47:10.360
<v Speaker 3>the guy in Ferguson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

864
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.070
<v Speaker 3>they're criminals who prey on black </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

865
00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.660
<v Speaker 3>but this guy has them as innocent blacks</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were gunned down by racist cops.</v>

866
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:20.703
<v Speaker 3>So at the opening of his book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is which he has called the </v>

867
00:47:23.651 --> 00:47:24.484
<v Speaker 3>definitive history of racism in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's exposed as a liar and he won the </v>

868
00:47:28.211 --> 00:47:29.044
<v Speaker 3>national book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our institutions have been just </v>

869
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 3>generally corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

870
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:37.270
<v Speaker 3>So what is this racist ideology of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left?</v>

871
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:38.913
<v Speaker 3>So for a lot of people hearing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a certain amount of people </v>

872
00:47:40.241 --> 00:47:41.074
<v Speaker 3>hearing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go,</v>

873
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.250
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

874
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:43.084
<v Speaker 3>So you don't talk quite like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I think you're much harder </v>

875
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

876
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

877
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:48.603
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wanting to see you with a so called </v>

878
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:53.130
<v Speaker 3>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't call them liberals.</v>

879
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.133
<v Speaker 3>They're bigots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

880
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had many progressive,</v>

881
00:47:55.451 --> 00:47:56.284
<v Speaker 3>a progressive on this show and I treat </v>
<v Speaker 3>them with the same respect that I treat </v>

882
00:47:59.081 --> 00:48:00.860
<v Speaker 3>anybody else I did.</v>

883
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.750
<v Speaker 3>My general rule is I don't find that </v>
<v Speaker 3>braiding somebody or belittling them,</v>

884
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:05.613
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made this bow ready 30 years ago that </v>

885
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:12.940
<v Speaker 3>I was going to berate the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say,</v>

886
00:48:12.941 --> 00:48:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Hey Lbj,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many kids did you kill today?</v>

887
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:17.223
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was still sort of leaving the </v>

888
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:21.670
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought about that statement a lot.</v>

889
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.163
<v Speaker 3>St.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if I were a prisoner of war </v>

890
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:26.944
<v Speaker 3>and I was in a room with my captor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would I rather it was Lbj or holcim and </v>

891
00:48:32.681 --> 00:48:33.514
<v Speaker 3>it was a no brainer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's part of it is that you just </v>

892
00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:38.614
<v Speaker 3>constantly say the worst thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>your intellectual opponents because </v>

893
00:48:41.531 --> 00:48:42.364
<v Speaker 3>there's no end here that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly say anything to you and </v>

894
00:48:47.411 --> 00:48:48.244
<v Speaker 3>that's why I love Milo because he just </v>
<v Speaker 3>throws it right back in their face and </v>

895
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:53.800
<v Speaker 3>that's what really needs to be done.</v>

896
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.490
<v Speaker 3>These people need to be embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alloying probably beyond embarrassment.</v>

897
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean ABC news stuff.</v>

898
00:49:02.711 --> 00:49:05.870
<v Speaker 3>Annapolis is sitting there with Katrina </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vanden who oval,</v>

899
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:06.723
<v Speaker 3>whose entire life has been spent </v>
<v Speaker 3>apologizing for defending and advancing </v>

900
00:49:11.261 --> 00:49:13.750
<v Speaker 3>communists causes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was that.</v>

901
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:18.100
<v Speaker 3>That's ABC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how far gone this country is.</v>

902
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.473
<v Speaker 3>So are all the answers then for you on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right or do you have frustrations </v>

903
00:49:23.351 --> 00:49:25.000
<v Speaker 3>with the right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think right before we started,</v>

904
00:49:25.001 --> 00:49:28.580
<v Speaker 3>we only talked for about 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Liberal.</v>

905
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:29.950
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to,</v>

906
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

907
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:36.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get know what did I.</v>

908
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

909
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:38.913
<v Speaker 3>I took on the leaders of the religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>right over a mark raw rash cope was the </v>

910
00:49:47.141 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 3>governor of Montana and was the chairman</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the RNC,</v>

911
00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.890
<v Speaker 3>met with the thing that's called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human rights association,</v>

912
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:58.891
<v Speaker 3>which is a gay group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he addressed them or whatever.</v>

913
00:49:59.051 --> 00:50:02.680
<v Speaker 3>I met with them and he was denounced by </v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul.</v>

914
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 3>Why Rick and very well known leaders of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the religious right.</v>

915
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.013
<v Speaker 3>And I wrote an article saying that I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 3>political party is not a religious </v>

916
00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:17.340
<v Speaker 3>movement or shouldn't be and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>job of the RNC chair to reach out and,</v>

917
00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:21.610
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so forth.</v>

918
00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.850
<v Speaker 3>And I've never been an opponent of gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage and I,</v>

919
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could go on on.</v>

920
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:31.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you mentioned before that abortion,</v>

921
00:50:31.021 --> 00:50:31.854
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although you're not a fan to say the </v>

922
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:35.780
<v Speaker 3>least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you are a pro choice,</v>

923
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:36.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

924
00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.053
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't describe myself as pro </v>

925
00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:38.630
<v Speaker 3>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

926
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:39.463
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

927
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:40.343
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

928
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:46.270
<v Speaker 3>and it's been a long lifetime of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rethinking this issue when I grew up,</v>

929
00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:48.413
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abortions were illegal after the third </v>

930
00:50:53.171 --> 00:50:54.004
<v Speaker 3>month and we know a lot more now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>medical techniques where we just know a </v>

931
00:51:01.601 --> 00:51:04.810
<v Speaker 3>lot more about fetuses and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

932
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:08.500
<v Speaker 3>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their children from conception.</v>

933
00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:09.401
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

934
00:51:09.401 --> 00:51:11.920
<v Speaker 3>it's not an argument as a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

935
00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:15.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think from the moment of women,</v>

936
00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.520
<v Speaker 3>it's not about the woman's body alone,</v>

937
00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:20.383
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

938
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

939
00:51:21.801 --> 00:51:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that fathers are involved as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

940
00:51:24.751 --> 00:51:28.470
<v Speaker 3>but certainly this child there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

941
00:51:28.471 --> 00:51:29.304
<v Speaker 3>the argument against it as you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring a kid into the world that's going </v>

942
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:32.534
<v Speaker 3>to have a absolutely miserable life </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's wrong parent at the wrong </v>

943
00:51:36.241 --> 00:51:37.410
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

944
00:51:37.411 --> 00:51:38.244
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the energy should be spent on </v>

945
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:46.310
<v Speaker 3>finding ways to take care of children </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the parents are unable to take care</v>

946
00:51:46.411 --> 00:51:49.800
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very vexed problem and I don't,</v>

947
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:51.613
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've confronted a right winger is </v>

948
00:51:54.091 --> 00:51:56.670
<v Speaker 3>actually was in the heritage foundation </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate,</v>

949
00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.490
<v Speaker 3>you know who said it's murder?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

950
00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:00.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think it's murder,</v>

951
00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:04.260
<v Speaker 3>then you should be demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The execution of every mother in America</v>

952
00:52:04.261 --> 00:52:08.220
<v Speaker 3>has had an abortion and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a much more complicated problem,</v>

953
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:09.533
<v Speaker 3>so that's kind of where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was his response to that and shine </v>

954
00:52:12.331 --> 00:52:12.940
<v Speaker 3>them up?</v>

955
00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.500
<v Speaker 3>That has a real quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why the abortion went to me is is</v>

956
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:17.443
<v Speaker 3>one where I think very good people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>both sides of this are just struggling </v>

957
00:52:21.481 --> 00:52:22.314
<v Speaker 3>with it because it almost is coming down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the basic questions of life and it </v>

958
00:52:26.221 --> 00:52:28.560
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't discuss basic questions in</v>

959
00:52:28.561 --> 00:52:30.870
<v Speaker 3>our political atmosphere and not with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left.</v>

960
00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:34.620
<v Speaker 3>The left wants to convert everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a morality play where they are.</v>

961
00:52:34.621 --> 00:52:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of this is culture?</v>

962
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that change to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>

963
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.823
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that culture is the most important </v>

964
00:52:41.551 --> 00:52:43.620
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when did it go from,</v>

965
00:52:43.621 --> 00:52:45.160
<v Speaker 3>like I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even left,</v>

966
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:46.263
<v Speaker 3>started taking over the universities in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the seventies now and they've got the k </v>

967
00:52:49.801 --> 00:52:52.290
<v Speaker 3>12 schools as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

968
00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:54.143
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I conducted a was literally five or six </v>

969
00:52:57.541 --> 00:53:01.610
<v Speaker 3>year campaign to try to get a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an economic bill of rights,</v>

970
00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:02.493
<v Speaker 3>really a student bill of rights that </v>
<v Speaker 3>students have a right to a professional </v>

971
00:53:06.511 --> 00:53:07.344
<v Speaker 3>education and a democracy that means </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have professors can express </v>

972
00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:12.354
<v Speaker 3>their opinions but they have to present </v>
<v Speaker 3>the opposing sides of controversial </v>

973
00:53:15.931 --> 00:53:17.460
<v Speaker 3>issues in a fair minded way.</v>

974
00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:21.470
<v Speaker 3>And I was attacked from one end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

975
00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Other is a Torquemada and a controller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very liberal.</v>

976
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

977
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.813
<v Speaker 2>I did it all out of their own documents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a very famous academic freedom </v>

978
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:33.230
<v Speaker 2>statement that was drawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

979
00:53:33.231 --> 00:53:36.300
<v Speaker 2>what's the thought control part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get more in there?</v>

980
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Don't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't be logic.</v>

981
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.170
<v Speaker 2>This is the aup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are stalinists.</v>

982
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:46.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean I debated them across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

983
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:47.470
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gosh,</v>

984
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean they put me through the ringer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

985
00:53:49.811 --> 00:53:50.644
<v Speaker 3>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd get to a point where you're liable </v>

986
00:53:51.971 --> 00:53:54.580
<v Speaker 3>proof because they've liable you so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

987
00:53:54.581 --> 00:53:55.570
<v Speaker 3>and it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does,</v>

988
00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.440
<v Speaker 3>but they fought it tooth and nail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for example,</v>

989
00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.480
<v Speaker 3>I had praised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

990
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:06.320
<v Speaker 3>in all of my speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a 1915,</v>

991
00:54:06.321 --> 00:54:07.154
<v Speaker 3>the statement on academic freedom by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>American Association of university </v>

992
00:54:10.211 --> 00:54:11.044
<v Speaker 3>professors and the Penn state still has </v>
<v Speaker 3>or had as its academic freedom </v>

993
00:54:17.021 --> 00:54:20.710
<v Speaker 3>provision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the statement that the obligate the,</v>

994
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:21.803
<v Speaker 3>it is not the place of a professor in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic society to indoctrinate his </v>

995
00:54:26.681 --> 00:54:27.514
<v Speaker 3>or her students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore they must present divergent </v>

996
00:54:31.241 --> 00:54:32.074
<v Speaker 3>opinions in a fair minded manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a paraphrase of and I praise </v>

997
00:54:35.921 --> 00:54:39.420
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the head of the Aup,</v>

998
00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:43.210
<v Speaker 3>Carrie Nelson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made it a personal crusade to get that</v>

999
00:54:43.211 --> 00:54:46.840
<v Speaker 3>ripped out of the Penn state academic </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>

1000
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.950
<v Speaker 2>So the so called liberal person right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now this to be removed.</v>

1001
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:52.690
<v Speaker 2>He's alive.</v>

1002
00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:53.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1003
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:54.770
<v Speaker 3>carry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually,</v>

1004
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:57.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's defended me in some places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's like an,</v>

1005
00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:01.940
<v Speaker 3>an whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1006
00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:06.850
<v Speaker 3>Not quite a bit a doctrinaire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he did the faculty senate.</v>

1007
00:55:06.851 --> 00:55:09.970
<v Speaker 3>They're ripped it out and took out </v>
<v Speaker 3>explicitly the thing.</v>

1008
00:55:09.971 --> 00:55:12.000
<v Speaker 3>It's not the place to indoctrinate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>student.</v>

1009
00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find when you,</v>

1010
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:14.323
<v Speaker 2>when you meet people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe some young people that are waking </v>

1011
00:55:16.491 --> 00:55:17.324
<v Speaker 2>up to some of this stuff at once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see one piece of it that the rest </v>

1012
00:55:20.031 --> 00:55:20.681
<v Speaker 2>of it crumbles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1013
00:55:20.681 --> 00:55:21.514
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I see this because I saw it </v>

1014
00:55:22.851 --> 00:55:24.520
<v Speaker 2>happen with myself obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1015
00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:27.890
<v Speaker 2>and for me it's still an unfolding </v>
<v Speaker 2>process I think.</v>

1016
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I'm happy to have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations,</v>

1017
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:31.580
<v Speaker 2>but I see it happening with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1018
00:55:31.581 --> 00:55:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get emails every day.</v>

1019
00:55:33.081 --> 00:55:33.914
<v Speaker 2>People would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one little thing happened and then </v>

1020
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:40.970
<v Speaker 2>months later I now believe everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was Steve Miller says it was guns.</v>

1021
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:44.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what turned him from a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and conservative.</v>

1022
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and progressives are responsible for,</v>

1037
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:25.443
<v Speaker 3>once you see that it's all over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there are people out there </v>

1042
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:48.070
<v Speaker 3>America sitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were only three people.</v>

1043
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:53.071
<v Speaker 3>The other person was William F Buckley </v>
<v Speaker 3>and was dead silence in the room.</v>

1044
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.353
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that Peter and I were silent </v>

1045
00:56:58.661 --> 00:56:59.494
<v Speaker 3>as we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we,</v>

1046
00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.373
<v Speaker 3>we had no idea who buckley was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just knew we didn't want to be nice </v>

1047
00:57:03.761 --> 00:57:04.594
<v Speaker 3>to a fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the left and called him a </v>

1048
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:09.640
<v Speaker 3>fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't want to be nice to a fascist.</v>

1049
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.600
<v Speaker 3>So Peter broke the ice by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother is a big fan of yours.</v>

1050
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:17.260
<v Speaker 3>And then we find out from Buckley who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a very gracious human being,</v>

1051
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:18.633
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was silent because his son had </v>

1052
00:57:21.281 --> 00:57:25.990
<v Speaker 3>just written a very critical attack on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy book.</v>

1053
00:57:25.991 --> 00:57:28.540
<v Speaker 3>That was another one that came out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't know if it was.</v>

1054
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1055
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:34.670
<v Speaker 3>civility on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:57:34.671 --> 00:57:35.640
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>

1057
00:57:35.641 --> 00:57:37.560
<v Speaker 3>it's fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

1058
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.330
<v Speaker 3>And if this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way.</v>

1059
00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:42.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only response you can have this one,</v>

1060
00:57:42.171 --> 00:57:45.570
<v Speaker 3>like Milo's it just go in their face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

1061
00:57:45.571 --> 00:57:47.520
<v Speaker 3>I just shot you down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1062
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.620
<v Speaker 2>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1063
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.473
<v Speaker 2>an incredible video that I saw a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of years ago have you at University of </v>

1064
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:58.080
<v Speaker 2>San Diego I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a young Muslim student gets out,</v>

1065
00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:00.720
<v Speaker 2>very articulate with a head scarf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1066
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:01.593
<v Speaker 2>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at first she opens by thanking you for </v>

1067
00:58:04.451 --> 00:58:05.284
<v Speaker 2>coming and saying she's sarcastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diversity of thought and people can </v>

1068
00:58:09.341 --> 00:58:11.860
<v Speaker 2>watch it and we'll link to it below so </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can actually watch the video.</v>

1069
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:12.873
<v Speaker 2>There's a weighing of sarcasm in it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it was either sarcasm or she was </v>

1070
00:58:15.611 --> 00:58:17.710
<v Speaker 2>trying to butter you up before she went </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill.</v>

1071
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.753
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you explain the rest of what </v>

1072
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:20.641
<v Speaker 2>happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1073
00:58:20.641 --> 00:58:20.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1074
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then edit it.</v>

1075
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.633
<v Speaker 3>She said I'm falsely accused the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>Students Association of being a front </v>

1076
00:58:30.001 --> 00:58:32.610
<v Speaker 3>for the Muslim Brotherhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it is and Hamas.</v>

1077
00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.080
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1078
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.580
<v Speaker 3>and we had distributed a pamphlet </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing this.</v>

1079
00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1080
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:47.120
<v Speaker 3>instead of arguing whether about whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Muslim Students Association students</v>

1081
00:58:47.221 --> 00:58:49.740
<v Speaker 3>for Justice in Palestine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're both amongst friends,</v>

1082
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Brotherhood Fronts A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of arguing with her,</v>

1083
00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:56.820
<v Speaker 3>I just decided to cut to the chase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1084
00:58:56.821 --> 00:58:59.700
<v Speaker 3>will you condemn a Mohs as a terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization?</v>

1085
00:58:59.701 --> 00:59:01.820
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1086
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.510
<v Speaker 3>you want to crucify me company?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1087
00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:08.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how I respond to coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>

1088
00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:09.444
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't condemn Hamas then I will be </v>

1089
00:59:12.271 --> 00:59:15.210
<v Speaker 3>arrested by the Department of Homeland </v>
<v Speaker 3>Security.</v>

1090
00:59:15.211 --> 00:59:19.850
<v Speaker 3>This is how delusional these people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I changed the question.</v>

1091
00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.600
<v Speaker 3>I had done this at other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I knew what to expect.</v>

1092
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.270
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me put it to you this way.</v>

1093
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:27.104
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Jew and the head of his bullet </v>
<v Speaker 3>says he wants us choose to gather in </v>

1094
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:31.394
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he won't have to hunt us down </v>

1095
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:33.343
<v Speaker 3>globally for it or against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She leaned into the microphone and said </v>

1096
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:38.143
<v Speaker 3>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was dependent afterwards by the </v>

1097
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:42.883
<v Speaker 3>Muslim Students Association.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A whole left.</v>

1098
00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Hey genocidal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to kill the Jews.</v>

1099
00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:48.723
<v Speaker 2>When she said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect you were not shocked as </v>

1100
00:59:50.711 --> 00:59:53.110
<v Speaker 2>insanely shocking as that sounds.</v>

1101
00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I had it at UC Santa Barbara.</v>

1102
00:59:56.671 --> 00:59:57.504
<v Speaker 3>I asked the same question of the head of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Muslim Students Association when he </v>

1103
01:00:00.961 --> 01:00:03.420
<v Speaker 3>said it was too complicated a question </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a yes.</v>

1104
01:00:03.421 --> 01:00:04.820
<v Speaker 3>No answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1105
01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Genocides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too complicated.</v>

1106
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.410
<v Speaker 3>He was smarter than she was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hers was just like,</v>

1107
01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:12.390
<v Speaker 3>hers was just showing you what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>think and what they want.</v>

1108
01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.651
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1109
01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:14.640
<v Speaker 3>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's shift</v>

1110
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.160
<v Speaker 2>to Islam then.</v>

1111
01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:19.383
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about it and I've </v>

1112
01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 2>tried to bring on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought on liberals to talk about it.</v>

1113
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1114
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.990
<v Speaker 2>very measured people like Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote pupils.</v>

1115
01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:27.973
<v Speaker 2>I've had ion Hirsi Ali on who talks </v>
<v Speaker 2>about her own personal enemies on the </v>

1116
01:00:31.731 --> 01:00:34.420
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who are at my new eyes,</v>

1117
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:36.330
<v Speaker 2>who's a Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1118
01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:38.760
<v Speaker 2>is still a leftist liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1119
01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:39.620
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a liberal,</v>

1120
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:40.454
<v Speaker 2>he's a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether that I don't want to speak for </v>

1121
01:00:42.021 --> 01:00:44.030
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get into any extra trouble.</v>

1122
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've had.</v>

1123
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:46.334
<v Speaker 2>My point is that I've had plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people thought of as liberals or on the </v>

1124
01:00:48.801 --> 01:00:51.080
<v Speaker 2>left discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get hate from the left.</v>

1125
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Then I've had people more on the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about it,</v>

1126
01:00:54.591 --> 01:00:55.424
<v Speaker 2>such as Lauren Southern and Ben Shapiro </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some others that of course they're </v>

1127
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.920
<v Speaker 2>going to get a certain amount of hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

1128
01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:05.300
<v Speaker 2>How do you gauge how much of a problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>this actually is</v>

1129
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.233
<v Speaker 3>at the moment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem being the problem being </v>

1130
01:01:09.271 --> 01:01:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Islamic extremism</v>

1131
01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.413
<v Speaker 3>where God or whatever you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Islam is a problem and no </v>

1132
01:01:17.261 --> 01:01:21.640
<v Speaker 3>rational person could not look at Islam </v>
<v Speaker 3>and say it's not a problematic religion.</v>

1133
01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:24.730
<v Speaker 3>It preaches hatred against all other </v>
<v Speaker 3>religions.</v>

1134
01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.080
<v Speaker 3>It's sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just a series of quotes from the</v>

1135
01:01:29.081 --> 01:01:33.970
<v Speaker 3>Korean sanctions where they're beheading</v>
<v Speaker 3>infidels,</v>

1136
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:34.833
<v Speaker 3>which is what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the Prophet Mohammed has has said </v>

1137
01:01:38.621 --> 01:01:39.454
<v Speaker 3>that the day of judgment will only come </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the Muslims fight the Jews and </v>

1138
01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:45.634
<v Speaker 3>killed them when the Jews behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rocks and the trees and the rocks and </v>

1139
01:01:49.631 --> 01:01:50.770
<v Speaker 3>the trees cry out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Muslim descent.</v>

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:02.170
<v Speaker 3>by organized Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1145
01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:06.920
<v Speaker 3>but it's repeated use of our Kara </v>
<v Speaker 3>doorway.</v>

1146

<v Speaker 3>of the Jews for their corruption.</v>

1151
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:32.700
<v Speaker 3>And it will come again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Tom Perez is no better,</v>

<v Speaker 3>for 11 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The spokesman for the nation of Islam.</v>

1176
01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.733
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have to repudiate what they did </v>

1177
01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:45.161
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1178
01:03:45.161 --> 01:03:48.040
<v Speaker 3>this is why I say Barack Obama is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>communist.</v>

1179
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:50.690
<v Speaker 3>He was raised by communists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1180
01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:51.723
<v Speaker 3>his whole political career until he </v>
<v Speaker 3>became United States senator was in the </v>

1181
01:03:56.471 --> 01:03:57.430
<v Speaker 3>Communists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

1182
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:58.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1183
01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I know these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1184
01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:05.290
<v Speaker 3>if you are a part of a movement that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know is evil,</v>

1185
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:08.140
<v Speaker 3>the first thing you want to do is warn </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people about it,</v>

1186
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:09.063
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's so deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It talks about social justice and all </v>

1187
01:04:12.461 --> 01:04:15.900
<v Speaker 3>this crap anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1188
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:17.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he hasn't.</v>

1189
01:04:17.231 --> 01:04:19.840
<v Speaker 3>So that's how you know what his </v>
<v Speaker 3>allegiances are.</v>

1190
01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:20.973
<v Speaker 3>And when you asked me about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was earlier in our conversation </v>

1191
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.033
<v Speaker 3>about why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is the Democratic Party so soft on </v>

1192
01:04:30.341 --> 01:04:31.174
<v Speaker 3>Islamic terrorists?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people of color that has to </v>

1193
01:04:36.761 --> 01:04:40.150
<v Speaker 3>play a big role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing you do is all we have to</v>

1194
01:04:40.151 --> 01:04:44.260
<v Speaker 3>understand if they're killing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be because we did something</v>

1195
01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:46.940
<v Speaker 2>very sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1196
01:04:46.941 --> 01:04:51.280
<v Speaker 2>What is that self flagellation that so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people in the West have guilt.</v>

1197
01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steel is really guilty of success</v>

1198
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:56.750
<v Speaker 3>has written a whole book called white </v>
<v Speaker 3>guilt.</v>

1199
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll bring down our,</v>

1200
01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.980
<v Speaker 3>our great civilization if it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1201
01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:06.530
<v Speaker 3>and we haven't talked about Donald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>

1202
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Objective my book.</v>

1203
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:08.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1204
01:05:08.581 --> 01:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is,</v>

1205
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I think if we have an antidote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1206
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:13.503
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you really believe that that trump </v>

1207
01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.070
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>was gonna say a second</v>

1209
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.810
<v Speaker 3>ago when you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1210
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.630
<v Speaker 3>fighting the roots of Islamic extremism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1211
01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Bannon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I understand,</v>

1212
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.720
<v Speaker 3>seems to be the architect of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a good guy.</v>

1213
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Steve Bennett.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1214
01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:35.860
<v Speaker 3>So you don't believe him to be an anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>Semite though.</v>

1215
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.510
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chief evidence,</v>

1216
01:05:37.511 --> 01:05:38.344
<v Speaker 3>there's evidence given that Steve Bannon</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an anti Semite one is a disgruntled </v>

1217
01:05:43.901 --> 01:05:45.980
<v Speaker 3>wife in the middle of a divorce </v>
<v Speaker 3>proceeding,</v>

1218
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:50.800
<v Speaker 3>a custody case who said who claim that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that Jewish children are whiny,</v>

1219
01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:53.200
<v Speaker 3>which melt way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1220
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:55.240
<v Speaker 3>be the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1221
01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:56.403
<v Speaker 3>the whole ritual of Bar Mitzvahs you </v>
<v Speaker 3>shower a 13 year old with tons of money </v>

1222
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:04.330
<v Speaker 3>and give them an audience of adults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1223
01:06:04.331 --> 01:06:07.170
<v Speaker 3>So they might be allowed to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might be whining,</v>

1224
01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:09.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1225
01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.130
<v Speaker 3>but that's certainly not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Waiting,</v>

1226
01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Regardless,</v>

1227
01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:17.410
<v Speaker 3>even if even if it did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

1228
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.780
<v Speaker 3>you'd have a big deal.</v>

1229
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:20.103
<v Speaker 3>His wife that over the kids and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to school and maybe the school </v>

1230
01:06:24.651 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 3>was very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an expensive school.</v>

1231
01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:28.053
<v Speaker 3>The archer school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other evidence is an article that I </v>

1232
01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:34.480
<v Speaker 3>wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave the title tooth bill,</v>

1233
01:06:34.481 --> 01:06:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Kristol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican spoiler,</v>

1234
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.930
<v Speaker 3>renegade Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people who haven't read your.</v>

1235
01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:43.780
<v Speaker 3>I read the article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not find anything and he's no read</v>

1236
01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.633
<v Speaker 3>a gay because he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to return Houma Aberdeen and </v>

1237
01:06:48.851 --> 01:06:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Ben Rhodes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the architect,</v>

1238
01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:52.163
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the architects of the Iran deal </v>

1239
01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:58.300
<v Speaker 3>back to power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a death knell for Israel.</v>

1240
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:59.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they've done,</v>

1241
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.983
<v Speaker 3>and not to mention the United I ran </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't powerful enough to destroy the </v>

1242
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.390
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's leaders do chant,</v>

1243
01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:09.370
<v Speaker 3>lead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chance of death to America.</v>

1244
01:07:09.371 --> 01:07:10.204
<v Speaker 3>That's what they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why if Franklin Roosevelt gave nuclear </v>

1245
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:16.090
<v Speaker 3>weapons to Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what will we call them?</v>

1246
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:17.463
<v Speaker 3>Obama is an American trader and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's a communist and always has </v>

1247
01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:23.290
<v Speaker 3>been and always will be.</v>

1248
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.760
<v Speaker 3>So I know enough people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it and go,</v>

1249
01:07:24.761 --> 01:07:25.594
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the deal says that they can't get </v>

1250
01:07:26.621 --> 01:07:27.341
<v Speaker 3>new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you would say,</v>

1251
01:07:27.341 --> 01:07:30.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it expires one.</v>

1252
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:35.080
<v Speaker 3>It expires to the effect of the deal was</v>
<v Speaker 3>to lift the sanctions,</v>

1253
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.840
<v Speaker 3>bring a ran back into the community of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nations.</v>

1254
01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:41.260
<v Speaker 3>He gave them $200,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion dollars,</v>

1255
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.750
<v Speaker 3>$200,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion.</v>

1256
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.780
<v Speaker 3>100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget all the payments and there's no</v>

1257
01:07:46.781 --> 01:07:50.410
<v Speaker 3>controls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even if there were controls,</v>

1258
01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:52.540
<v Speaker 3>why would you bring them out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>isolation?</v>

1259
01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ran is running over the Middle East.</v>

1260
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:55.923
<v Speaker 3>They overthrew the government in Yemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why we now are losing American </v>

1261
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 3>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their mind.</v>

1262
01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if some of the.</v>

1263
01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:08.700
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I sought that crystal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't attack crystal during,</v>

1264
01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.920
<v Speaker 3>during the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1265
01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:12.660
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1266
01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:16.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see Donald trump.</v>

1267
01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:18.850
<v Speaker 3>I can see why he upset some people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1268
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:22.400
<v Speaker 3>I can see how in my view they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>exaggerated,</v>

1269
01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whatever,</v>

1270
01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:26.050
<v Speaker 3>the fears that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1271
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:31.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it per second that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti Mexican or a bigoted in any way.</v>

1272
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:32.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

1273
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:33.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

1274
01:08:33.601 --> 01:08:34.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of those people that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1275
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:37.070
<v Speaker 3>like he's been in public life for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1276
01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.083
<v Speaker 3>He didn't become a racist and until he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was running against a Democrat for </v>

1277
01:08:41.601 --> 01:08:43.480
<v Speaker 3>crying out tears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1278
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:44.330
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1279
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:45.283
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see a lot of people would get </v>

1280
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:52.580
<v Speaker 3>bent out of shape during the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once he's the nominee,</v>

1281
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:56.180
<v Speaker 3>then it's him or hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it's Hillary,</v>

1282
01:08:56.181 --> 01:08:58.280
<v Speaker 3>it's whom I aberdeen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1283
01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:01.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole anti Israel crew.</v>

1284
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.430
<v Speaker 3>So you can sympathize then with bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crystal is intense.</v>

1285
01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.740
<v Speaker 3>So Bill Kristol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wanted conservatism,</v>

1286
01:09:06.741 --> 01:09:07.574
<v Speaker 3>Ole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1287
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.960
<v Speaker 3>what's thought of as relied real </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative.</v>

1288
01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:11.623
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are people treating politics as a </v>

1289
01:09:14.621 --> 01:09:15.454
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1290
01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:16.453
<v Speaker 3>if you don't refer to the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a constitutional republic </v>

1291
01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:23.480
<v Speaker 3>conservative if you don't use the phrase</v>
<v Speaker 3>limited government,</v>

1292
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.700
<v Speaker 3>limited government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never said that,</v>

1293
01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:28.850
<v Speaker 3>that I know what he's doing now.</v>

1294
01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:31.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's cutting the government and a big.</v>

1295
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.550
<v Speaker 3>So there'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1296
01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:37.100
<v Speaker 3>it's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He won me over this way.</v>

1297
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:38.263
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was nervous about him through the </v>

1298
01:09:39.321 --> 01:09:41.380
<v Speaker 3>campaign because you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1299
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is his first venture into politics.</v>

1300
01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:47.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not nervous about him anymore,</v>

1301
01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:49.820
<v Speaker 3>although I think he'll disappoint me on </v>
<v Speaker 3>some things,</v>

1302
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:54.050
<v Speaker 3>but he won me over in the first debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a guy,</v>

1303
01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:58.850
<v Speaker 3>he's never been a political candidate </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1304
01:09:59.130 --> 01:09:59.963
<v Speaker 3>is on a platform with a 12 of the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans in the country is in front </v>

1305
01:10:06.561 --> 01:10:07.394
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember if it's 30 million </v>

1306
01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.033
<v Speaker 3>people or whatever it is and the front </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he gets the first question because </v>

1307
01:10:13.551 --> 01:10:17.180
<v Speaker 3>he has the highest percentage in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>polls and it's not a question.</v>

1308
01:10:17.181 --> 01:10:22.181
<v Speaker 3>It's an attack from a beggar and Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you called women fat pigs,</v>

1309
01:10:22.311 --> 01:10:25.700
<v Speaker 3>slobs and dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he says,</v>

1310
01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:27.320
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was just rosie o'donnell.</v>

1311
01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.090
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is a guy.</v>

1312
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:34.210
<v Speaker 3>They can intimidate because political </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness is a party line.</v>

1313
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.040
<v Speaker 3>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes from now,</v>

1314
01:10:37.041 --> 01:10:40.220
<v Speaker 3>let's say like a Communist Party line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shuts you up.</v>

1315
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:41.923
<v Speaker 3>There is no other Republican under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sun who on national TV this time in </v>

1316
01:10:46.761 --> 01:10:50.300
<v Speaker 3>front of 50 million people would elect </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton in the eye and said,</v>

1317
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:53.660
<v Speaker 3>you're a liar and a crook even though </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's both.</v>

1318
01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:56.210
<v Speaker 3>If it were a male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would say it.</v>

1319
01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:57.613
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because because there's this gigantic </v>

1320
01:11:00.261 --> 01:11:01.094
<v Speaker 3>double standard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's politically incorrect to say </v>

1321
01:11:05.151 --> 01:11:08.570
<v Speaker 3>anything critical about a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is ridiculous.</v>

1322
01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:11.210
<v Speaker 3>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't be in politics.</v>

1323
01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Now I've left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just take that phrase,</v>

1324
01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 3>but you can't be protected and at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time pretend to be strong.</v>

1325
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:19.973
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting how pernicious some of </v>

1326
01:11:20.671 --> 01:11:22.650
<v Speaker 3>this stuff is because I'll even see </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes if if a,</v>

1327
01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:23.543
<v Speaker 3>if a man attacked me on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that twitter fights are that </v>

1328
01:11:25.711 --> 01:11:26.544
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll immediately defend myself and </v>

1329
01:11:27.901 --> 01:11:28.734
<v Speaker 3>come back and I've had a few instances </v>
<v Speaker 3>where women have and I've just ignored </v>

1330
01:11:31.831 --> 01:11:34.470
<v Speaker 3>it because I don't want to attack a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman and I know that's my own.</v>

1331
01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Then that's just my own reflection of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we've all been schooled in that and</v>

1332
01:11:40.561 --> 01:11:43.410
<v Speaker 3>then there's penalties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to think quickly about what the</v>

1333
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:44.303
<v Speaker 3>consequences are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that desire to punch back or to not </v>

1334
01:11:48.661 --> 01:11:50.550
<v Speaker 3>be held hostage by political correctness</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I said,</v>

1335
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.780
<v Speaker 3>would you argue that that is far more </v>
<v Speaker 3>important than any of his political?</v>

1336
01:11:54.781 --> 01:11:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I saw.</v>

1337
01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Here's a guy who the Democrats can </v>
<v Speaker 3>intimidate.</v>

1338
01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:04.110
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use this phrase in my speeches,</v>

1339
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.650
<v Speaker 3>whenever I see a Republican square off </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the Democrat,</v>

1340
01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.610
<v Speaker 3>it looks to me like Godzilla vs Bambi </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Republican,</v>

1341
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:12.503
<v Speaker 3>the Democrat is going to call the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans are racist or sexist or </v>

1342
01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:16.734
<v Speaker 3>homophobic and Islamophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Republican will call the </v>

1343
01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:23.850
<v Speaker 3>Democrat a liberal who's going to win </v>
<v Speaker 3>that argument.</v>

1344
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.863
<v Speaker 3>So this is a bulldozer or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I love the way they call trump a </v>

1345
01:12:28.801 --> 01:12:30.930
<v Speaker 3>blitzkrieg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Democrat blitzkrieg.</v>

1346
01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:34.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a tradition in this country.</v>

1347
01:12:34.201 --> 01:12:37.890
<v Speaker 3>It's sacred to a democracy of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>honeymoon for an incoming president.</v>

1348
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:41.130
<v Speaker 3>It says there's a peaceful transition of</v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

1349
01:12:41.131 --> 01:12:41.964
<v Speaker 3>It says we're all part of one community </v>
<v Speaker 3>since we're going to see what you do </v>

1350
01:12:45.601 --> 01:12:50.601
<v Speaker 3>have that will free to criticize you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the remedy is the next election.</v>

1351
01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.600
<v Speaker 3>Trump didn't get seven seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't get confirmation hearings.</v>

1352
01:12:54.601 --> 01:12:56.390
<v Speaker 3>He got a witch hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1353
01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:00.030
<v Speaker 3>and this is another example of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>political correctness works.</v>

1354
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.990
<v Speaker 3>A Jeff sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've known him for 20 years,</v>

1355
01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:05.323
<v Speaker 3>and I've known a lot of senators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of a handful of the most decent </v>

1356
01:13:07.921 --> 01:13:12.540
<v Speaker 3>human decent human beings in the senate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A champion of civil rights,</v>

1357
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.733
<v Speaker 3>this was an attorney general and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>deep South say state who prosecuted the </v>

1358
01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:21.180
<v Speaker 3>Ku Klux Klan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who desegregated the schools and there's</v>

1359
01:13:21.181 --> 01:13:22.014
<v Speaker 3>Elizabeth Warren calling him a racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then violating Senate rules to </v>

1360
01:13:26.071 --> 01:13:29.430
<v Speaker 3>repeat calling him a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when she's told to shut up,</v>

1361
01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:31.110
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1362
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.920
<v Speaker 3>they're silencing another woman.</v>

1363
01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell effect of political correctness.</v>

1364
01:13:36.901 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Is it just to be clear for people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't follow that whole thing?</v>

1365
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.793
<v Speaker 3>She was reading other people's words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't technically allowed in the </v>

1366
01:13:43.771 --> 01:13:44.604
<v Speaker 3>sentence so that she was doing something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that she wasn't allowed to do by their </v>

1367
01:13:46.501 --> 01:13:47.334
<v Speaker 3>own rules exam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone turned it into a letter from </v>

1368
01:13:50.221 --> 01:13:52.650
<v Speaker 3>Coretta Scott King that she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>repudiated.</v>

1369
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:57.830
<v Speaker 3>What happened was in Alabama there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were three blacks who,</v>

1370
01:13:58.820 --> 01:13:59.653
<v Speaker 3>who's were defrauded of their voting </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights because they were in opposition </v>

1371
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.680
<v Speaker 3>to three other blacks who were NACP </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt officials.</v>

1372
01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:09.023
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole case and and a sessions</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know how to defend himself the </v>

1373
01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:15.670
<v Speaker 3>first time he was up in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1374
01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:16.504
<v Speaker 3>this is a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans are not used to fighting </v>

1375
01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:21.460
<v Speaker 3>back that you're used to getting out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>

1376
01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you if people are calling </v>
<v Speaker 3>you racist,</v>

1377
01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:25.750
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobic,</v>

1378
01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:30.440
<v Speaker 2>so it's obvious to me that that stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not working as much anymore.</v>

1379
01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.950
<v Speaker 2>So then my last question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that that is amazing,</v>

1380
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:35.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the words aren't,</v>

1381
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:36.283
<v Speaker 2>but what I now think is we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see more violence because they've been </v>

1382
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:39.463
<v Speaker 2>pinned into a corner where everyone that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're against is a Nazi and a racist </v>

1383
01:14:42.231 --> 01:14:43.064
<v Speaker 2>and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I suspect we're going to see more </v>

1384
01:14:45.201 --> 01:14:48.650
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my last question to you is with this</v>

1385
01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:53.030
<v Speaker 2>evolution with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with now the first Republican,</v>

1386
01:14:53.031 --> 01:14:55.280
<v Speaker 2>as you were saying with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to take it.</v>

1387
01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:57.533
<v Speaker 2>What's the good path now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if you could see something </v>

1388
01:15:00.231 --> 01:15:02.210
<v Speaker 2>good coming out of these next couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>

1389
01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.350
<v Speaker 2>What is that path?</v>

1390
01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:05.953
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a Antonio Gramsci won't said that </v>

1391
01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:16.850
<v Speaker 3>the revolutionary for the revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>must have pessimism of the intellect and</v>

1392
01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.040
<v Speaker 3>optimism of the will and I think he </v>
<v Speaker 3>stole that from somebody or I can't.</v>

1393
01:15:26.061 --> 01:15:28.010
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he did it.</v>

1394
01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.780
<v Speaker 3>It's in wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1395
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:32.740
<v Speaker 3>if it's in Wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but definitely stolen from somebody,</v>

1396
01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:36.140
<v Speaker 3>I um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1397
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1398
01:15:37.251 --> 01:15:39.410
<v Speaker 3>my head was telling me there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is good.</v>

1399
01:15:39.411 --> 01:15:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Is gonna come and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can see,</v>

1400
01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:43.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many,</v>

1401
01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.530
<v Speaker 3>so many problems of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1402
01:15:48.531 --> 01:15:49.780
<v Speaker 3>as I pointed out in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1403
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:50.960
<v Speaker 3>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my book,</v>

1404
01:15:50.961 --> 01:15:52.340
<v Speaker 3>big agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left,</v>

1405
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:55.040
<v Speaker 3>the Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1406
01:15:55.210 --> 01:16:00.210
<v Speaker 3>it's a totalitarian party now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lied to get obamacare and lied about.</v>

1407
01:16:00.501 --> 01:16:03.560
<v Speaker 3>You can keep your doctor lied about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can keep your plan.</v>

1408
01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:05.750
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and its mission was control.</v>

1409
01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:11.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a credible assault on individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>

1410
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:14.930
<v Speaker 3>The government tells you you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have insurance.</v>

1411
01:16:14.931 --> 01:16:16.910
<v Speaker 3>The government tells you you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

1412
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:19.820
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they for packages.</v>

1413
01:16:20.690 --> 01:16:22.880
<v Speaker 3>This is the kind of insurance you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have.</v>

1414
01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:26.840
<v Speaker 3>And the government gets all your health </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1415
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.110
<v Speaker 3>That is a totalitarian threat right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1416
01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.870
<v Speaker 3>But Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're lame.</v>

1417
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't they saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So replacing Obamacare is obviously,</v>

1418
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:40.551
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1419
01:16:40.551 --> 01:16:41.384
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we're speaking and Republicans are </v>

1420
01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:45.050
<v Speaker 3>all in disarray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1421
01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.593
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going to happen of </v>

1422
01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.133
<v Speaker 3>trump is fairly isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have all these conservative idiots </v>

1423
01:16:55.041 --> 01:16:56.690
<v Speaker 3>like crystal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1424
01:16:57.250 --> 01:16:58.083
<v Speaker 3>and make mullen gunning for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Republicans marched to the tune of </v>

1425
01:17:03.351 --> 01:17:08.351
<v Speaker 3>their own set of traumas all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>were individualist.</v>

1426
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:10.243
<v Speaker 3>I was amazed when the tea party came in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and held a demonstration in Washington </v>

1427
01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.553
<v Speaker 3>before that you couldn't get three </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans to march together because </v>

1428
01:17:18.651 --> 01:17:20.830
<v Speaker 3>they look at each other and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we collecting this?</v>

1429
01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:24.020
<v Speaker 3>So does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then Eric said it was the last question,</v>

1430
01:17:24.021 --> 01:17:25.670
<v Speaker 3>but we'll keep going for a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's that though.</v>

1431
01:17:25.671 --> 01:17:29.180
<v Speaker 3>So when the tea party organized and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tea party was gaining momentum,</v>

1432
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:32.330
<v Speaker 3>everyone was saying there were these </v>
<v Speaker 3>redneck back race,</v>

1433
01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:36.740
<v Speaker 3>very decent people who cleaned up after </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

1434
01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 3>That's just destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody was hurt.</v>

1435
01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:42.690
<v Speaker 3>There was no violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cops this,</v>

1436
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.060
<v Speaker 3>when people start referring to the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>as fascists and not liberals,</v>

1437
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.070
<v Speaker 3>then I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1438
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 3>we're winning now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now it isn't happening.</v>

1439
01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.680
<v Speaker 3>They go on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1440
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:55.790
<v Speaker 3>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1441
01:17:55.791 --> 01:17:58.620
<v Speaker 3>it's corrupted our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's corrupted our schools.</v>

1442
01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.520
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just very,</v>

1443
01:18:01.521 --> 01:18:03.740
<v Speaker 3>very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>

1444
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:05.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1445
01:18:05.031 --> 01:18:05.864
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my faith isn't Steve Bannon and Stephen </v>

1446
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:08.743
<v Speaker 3>Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are two fighters and trump and </v>

1447
01:18:11.751 --> 01:18:15.290
<v Speaker 3>trump understands instinctively that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get attacked,</v>

1448
01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:17.990
<v Speaker 3>you attack back and throw them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1449
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have this phrase that I,</v>

1450
01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.810
<v Speaker 3>I picked up from Chris Lehane is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic,</v>

1451
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:24.703
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was in the New York Times article about </v>

1452
01:18:26.361 --> 01:18:29.360
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a democratic strategists,</v>

1453
01:18:29.361 --> 01:18:32.360
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he stole it from Mike Tyson,</v>

1454
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:37.490
<v Speaker 3>which is everybody has a game plan until</v>
<v Speaker 3>you punch them in the mouth.</v>

1455
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:39.403
<v Speaker 3>And the Democrats have a massive punch </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the mouth for Republicans calling </v>

1456
01:18:42.111 --> 01:18:47.111
<v Speaker 3>them racists and Republicans at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Comeback and Democrats.</v>

1457
01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.900
<v Speaker 3>The Democratic Party is the party of </v>
<v Speaker 3>racism.</v>

1458
01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.700
<v Speaker 3>It's the party of racial categories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the party of identity politics.</v>

1459
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:59.870
<v Speaker 3>It's the party of the inner cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a racist party.</v>

1460
01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:02.220
<v Speaker 3>It is also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I loved this,</v>

1461
01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:06.080
<v Speaker 3>but what trump said in the was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>second debate,</v>

1462
01:19:06.710 --> 01:19:07.543
<v Speaker 3>he turned to the cameras and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand Hillary has </v>

1463
01:19:10.881 --> 01:19:11.714
<v Speaker 3>tremendous hatred in her heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what he was referring to was the </v>

1464
01:19:15.921 --> 01:19:18.200
<v Speaker 3>basket of deplorables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he named.</v>

1465
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:21.860
<v Speaker 3>She identified all of her opponents or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1466
01:19:21.861 --> 01:19:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Half it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing,</v>

1467
01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are racist,</v>

1468
01:19:26.391 --> 01:19:27.860
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobes,</v>

1469
01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Xenophobes,</v>

1470
01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:30.374
<v Speaker 3>you name it and he's raised them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a conservative or a </v>

1471
01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:36.253
<v Speaker 3>deviating liberal who hasn't been in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument with a so called liberal who </v>

1472
01:19:40.671 --> 01:19:44.780
<v Speaker 3>hasn't been called a racist or sexist or</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobic to in a way that was a gift.</v>

1473
01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:48.230
<v Speaker 3>The Democratic Party is a party of hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they run on.</v>

1474
01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.633
<v Speaker 3>Everything they're doing now is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is hate invent conspiracy theories with </v>

1475
01:19:54.951 --> 01:19:58.700
<v Speaker 3>the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this from a party who's candidate</v>

1476
01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:02.720
<v Speaker 3>turned over 20 percent of America's </v>
<v Speaker 3>uranium reserves that are Russians.</v>

1477
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:05.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you deal with that?</v>

1478
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:09.000
<v Speaker 3>The only way and politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a nine second soundbite.</v>

1479
01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Just go for the juggler.</v>

1480
01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope I don't want you.</v>

1481
01:20:13.351 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like your style.</v>

1482
01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:18.420
<v Speaker 2>I want to see if we can convert people </v>
<v Speaker 2>at way.</v>

1483
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think interesting,</v>

1484
01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:22.080
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think interestingly,</v>

1485
01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:25.580
<v Speaker 2>people or can be converted on both sides</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think what's happening is I,</v>

1486
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:26.623
<v Speaker 2>I know for sure that I've helped a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of progressives realized what true </v>

1487
01:20:29.881 --> 01:20:30.714
<v Speaker 2>liberalism is and at the same time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think I've had and I know that I've </v>

1488
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:34.973
<v Speaker 2>gotten a lot of more conservative people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to realize that not all liberals are </v>

1489
01:20:38.551 --> 01:20:39.384
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's where most of us </v>

1490
01:20:40.291 --> 01:20:42.600
<v Speaker 2>actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

1491
01:20:42.601 --> 01:20:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take anything away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1492
01:20:44.251 --> 01:20:45.750
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found</v>

1493
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.633
<v Speaker 3>when I came into the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I conservatives are generally very </v>

1494
01:20:49.221 --> 01:20:54.221
<v Speaker 3>decent people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I criticize the religious right</v>

1495
01:20:54.921 --> 01:20:55.754
<v Speaker 3>leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had different reactions from things </v>

1496
01:20:58.641 --> 01:21:02.180
<v Speaker 3>like the Family Research Council.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had people in my face,</v>

1497
01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.250
<v Speaker 3>blood vessels popping screaming at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1498
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:10.250
<v Speaker 3>and I had people who were very </v>
<v Speaker 3>supportive,</v>

1499
01:21:10.251 --> 01:21:11.430
<v Speaker 3>very Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1500
01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.793
<v Speaker 3>and that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also had this experience in the </v>

1501
01:21:15.441 --> 01:21:18.080
<v Speaker 3>2008.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at the moral majority,</v>

1502
01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:19.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ralph Reed and invited me to come down </v>

1503
01:21:21.411 --> 01:21:25.390
<v Speaker 3>to Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the woman who,</v>

1504
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:29.720
<v Speaker 3>who was my connection there and a moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>majority member,</v>

1505
01:21:29.721 --> 01:21:30.800
<v Speaker 3>I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1506
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:33.140
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if John McCain gets the nomination,</v>

1507
01:21:33.141 --> 01:21:34.490
<v Speaker 3>will you vote for him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>

1508
01:21:34.491 --> 01:21:35.324
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1509
01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:38.550
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that what the,</v>

1510
01:21:38.551 --> 01:21:39.384
<v Speaker 3>what the religious right needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand is that there's religion and </v>

1511
01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:42.783
<v Speaker 3>there's politics and religion is about </v>
<v Speaker 3>saving your immortal soul and if you </v>

1512
01:21:47.831 --> 01:21:51.370
<v Speaker 3>mess with the devil you in danger it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

1513
01:21:51.371 --> 01:21:53.110
<v Speaker 3>you make pacts with the devil all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1514
01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:55.513
<v Speaker 3>It's about getting into office and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to practically changed some </v>

1515
01:21:58.541 --> 01:21:59.374
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one thing that I wanted to talk yes </v>

1516
01:22:01.811 --> 01:22:04.070
<v Speaker 3>to talk to you about that I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>remembered it.</v>

1517
01:22:04.071 --> 01:22:05.550
<v Speaker 3>The home studio so we can keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1518
01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.640
<v Speaker 3>you go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>

1519
01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:11.100
<v Speaker 3>Is this um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is the,</v>

1520
01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:14.620
<v Speaker 3>why is the left and now so called </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberalism?</v>

1521
01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:20.180
<v Speaker 3>Why are progressive totalitarians?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is that they,</v>

1522
01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.220
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a crypto.</v>

1523
01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:25.173
<v Speaker 3>Religious ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's modeled on Christianity in the </v>

1524
01:22:32.241 --> 01:22:34.910
<v Speaker 3>world is a fallen place so that he never</v>
<v Speaker 3>used that.</v>

1525
01:22:34.911 --> 01:22:39.230
<v Speaker 3>The world is an oppressive place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's injustice rules.</v>

1526
01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:43.760
<v Speaker 3>But there will be a redemption and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>are the redeemer's.</v>

1527
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:48.500
<v Speaker 3>That's the danger we have to re and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>use it all the time.</v>

1528
01:22:48.501 --> 01:22:52.610
<v Speaker 3>We have to remake humanity so it fits </v>
<v Speaker 3>our model of the redemption.</v>

1529
01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.300
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if only Bernie was in,</v>

1530
01:22:56.330 --> 01:23:00.320
<v Speaker 3>we have to outlaw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to stamp out racist,</v>

1531
01:23:00.321 --> 01:23:03.680
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobic people who we disagree with.</v>

1532
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can let him speak.</v>

1533
01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:09.893
<v Speaker 2>That is what is the only difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between that and an actual totalitarian </v>

1534
01:23:14.361 --> 01:23:17.330
<v Speaker 2>state is if they had the power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would execute my law.</v>

1535
01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:20.540
<v Speaker 2>It'd be in a gulag or he'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>

1536
01:23:20.541 --> 01:23:21.374
<v Speaker 2>There was a line a couple of years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>that oprah who and I basically like </v>

1537
01:23:23.991 --> 01:23:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Oprah and respect are open and I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to run the show.</v>

1538
01:23:26.091 --> 01:23:26.924
<v Speaker 2>Of course when she was talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>older generation and some of their </v>

1539
01:23:30.321 --> 01:23:31.880
<v Speaker 2>backwards ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vega and she said,</v>

1540
01:23:31.881 --> 01:23:32.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>

1541
01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:34.730
<v Speaker 2>they just have to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking like,</v>

1542
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:38.130
<v Speaker 2>even if what you're saying that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be,</v>

1543
01:23:38.131 --> 01:23:38.964
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies show that younger people are </v>

1544
01:23:39.861 --> 01:23:42.710
<v Speaker 2>generally more liberal on the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>

1545
01:23:42.711 --> 01:23:43.570
<v Speaker 2>not more liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll,</v>

1546
01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.980
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The older blacks are liberal.</v>

1547
01:23:45.981 --> 01:23:49.540
<v Speaker 2>That's why Oprah doesn't like them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>so well,</v>

1548
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:51.320
<v Speaker 2>that sort of fits everything else that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

1549
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.360
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point being that when she said,</v>

1550
01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.400
<v Speaker 2>it sounds so nice to me because one day </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just,</v>

1551
01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:58.580
<v Speaker 2>if you take that logic to its end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

1552
01:23:58.581 --> 01:23:59.414
<v Speaker 2>One day the young people are gonna want </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of you did when you're old because </v>

1553
01:24:02.301 --> 01:24:04.880
<v Speaker 2>it just will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll just keep going.</v>

1554
01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Can't try to make sense out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is,</v>

1555
01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:08.084
<v Speaker 2>it's the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the actually the reverse </v>

1556
01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:11.000
<v Speaker 2>shareholder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blacks</v>

1557
01:24:14.130 --> 01:24:16.310
<v Speaker 3>I know as racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as younger blacks,</v>

1558
01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:17.653
<v Speaker 3>racism is pervasive now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a very politically </v>

1559
01:24:21.231 --> 01:24:25.330
<v Speaker 3>incorrect to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's pretty obvious racist,</v>

1560
01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:26.413
<v Speaker 3>pervasive racism is pervasive in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>black community and especially among </v>

1561
01:24:30.021 --> 01:24:30.854
<v Speaker 3>younger people who've been to schools </v>
<v Speaker 3>and told that their all their problems </v>

1562
01:24:35.091 --> 01:24:38.390
<v Speaker 3>come from white racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very bad.</v>

1563
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:39.703
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1564
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:43.960
<v Speaker 2>the fifties were much better times in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>

1565
01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:44.943
<v Speaker 2>So I think I only got a half answer then</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you said my head doesn't have a </v>

1566
01:24:48.371 --> 01:24:50.710
<v Speaker 2>lot of hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something to that effect about Roger.</v>

1567
01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.780
<v Speaker 2>But what about you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1568
01:24:52.781 --> 01:24:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an optimist by genes.</v>

1569
01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1570
01:24:56.210 --> 01:24:57.043
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>

1571
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:58.850
<v Speaker 3>I just am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1572
01:24:58.851 --> 01:25:02.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I phrased it in a book I wrote.</v>

1573
01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:03.653
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when my head is in conflict with my </v>

1574
01:25:06.081 --> 01:25:07.370
<v Speaker 3>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I followed my heart,</v>

1575
01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:12.610
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to fight so I drop as long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be a positive outcome.</v>

1576
01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.880
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1577
01:25:16.881 --> 01:25:18.920
<v Speaker 3>there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was his name?</v>

1578
01:25:18.921 --> 01:25:23.921
<v Speaker 3>Skipio Africanness was a Roman general </v>
<v Speaker 3>who burned carthage.</v>

1579
01:25:25.890 --> 01:25:29.330
<v Speaker 3>And when he saw carthage going up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke,</v>

1580
01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:35.200
<v Speaker 3>he wept because the classical view was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1581
01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:39.220
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all cyclical empires rise and fall,</v>

1582
01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:40.083
<v Speaker 3>societies rise and fall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this idea of progress is one of the </v>

1583
01:25:44.121 --> 01:25:48.290
<v Speaker 3>really bad ideas that the Jews gave to </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1584
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:50.630
<v Speaker 3>The idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the promise land,</v>

1585
01:25:51.170 --> 01:25:54.620
<v Speaker 3>although maybe Moses didn't beat it in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that left this meeting,</v>

1586
01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.640
<v Speaker 3>but that idea of a progress is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1587
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Can't redeem the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't be fixed.</v>

1588
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.003
<v Speaker 3>Why can't the world be fixed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the root source of all social </v>

1589
01:26:08.211 --> 01:26:13.211
<v Speaker 3>problems is us individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can maybe,</v>

1590
01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:14.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1591
01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:15.333
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to take one individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's gone off the day band and bring </v>

1592
01:26:19.971 --> 01:26:21.110
<v Speaker 3>them back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1593
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:23.570
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modest.</v>

1594
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:24.291
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1595
01:26:24.291 --> 01:26:27.530
<v Speaker 3>and this is the oldest thing as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>voltaire 10 year old garden.</v>

1596
01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:32.240
<v Speaker 3>You can make the space around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You may be a little bit more humane.</v>

1597
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:36.830
<v Speaker 3>You can help an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't change the world.</v>

1598
01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that note I sent,</v>

1599
01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:41.380
<v Speaker 2>we could do a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll have to do this again.</v>

1600
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

1601
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:43.383
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about we do this one year from now </v>

1602
01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:49.500
<v Speaker 2>and we'll see if I've incorporated </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimist.</v>

1603
01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm an optimist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

1604
01:26:52.710 --> 01:26:54.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm old enough to know that,</v>

1605
01:26:54.941 --> 01:26:57.310
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will be a blessing.</v>

1606
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:59.380
<v Speaker 2>You're 78 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you look?</v>

1607
01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:00.214
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

1608
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:01.723
<v Speaker 3>Your makeup,</v>

1609
01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 2>that's all the makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1610
