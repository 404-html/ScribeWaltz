00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.893
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is an author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a professor in evolutionary behavioral </v>

2
00:00:09.111 --> 00:00:09.944
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man who wears a bow tie when speaking </v>

3
00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>to the Canadian parliament and a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an incredible tan,</v>

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Gaad Saad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back to the Rubin report.</v>

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 1>So nice to be back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Dave.</v>

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>The Tan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that our cameras,</v>

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the new tube through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wires and the tubes or whatever.</v>

8
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:29.540
<v Speaker 1>It gets it out to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it can take that level</v>

9
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:31.760
<v Speaker 1>of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just you being next to me.</v>

10
00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so because I've never felt whiter</v>

11
00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>than I feel right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is that good Lebanese skin that you</v>

12
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.210
<v Speaker 1>had as A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

13
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>so you've been on the show many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were my.</v>

14
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 1>My first year on the first test show of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rubin report.</v>

15
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 1>You were on the first panel we ever did.</v>

16
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>We've done one on ones a couple times </v>
<v Speaker 1>from getting to know you.</v>

17
00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:53.264
<v Speaker 1>You have just been in sort of what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would call the fight that is happening </v>

18
00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The free speech fight,</v>

19
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.900
<v Speaker 1>the fight for enlightenment values for </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal values.</v>

20
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.313
<v Speaker 1>but I thought a nice way to start would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be you would happen to be on vacation </v>

22
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.730
<v Speaker 1>You were in the midst of a five weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cal vacation.</v>

24
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And how important is that when you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that puts yourself out there all</v>

25
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:17.271
<v Speaker 1>the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>

26
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:20.480
<v Speaker 1>you just spoke to Canadian parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were at Google doing a talk.</v>

27
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean just as someone that's always out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

28
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 1>The shutdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How important.</v>

29
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I am,</v>

30
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.963
<v Speaker 1>I've done a few shows while I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a bit of work interspersed </v>

31
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.400
<v Speaker 1>within the vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terribly important.</v>

32
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.233
<v Speaker 1>Not so much for going to the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for disconnecting from being </v>

33
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.863
<v Speaker 1>available to the public now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always promised my wife that I will </v>

34
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not check a single social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media and then usually that lasts three,</v>

35
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:45.614
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five days and then I succumb to the </v>

36
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:47.624
<v Speaker 1>temptation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that I think is fundamentally the </v>

37
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:50.804
<v Speaker 1>most important part of my vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to not weigh in every hour on </v>

38
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>twitter to just disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:57.314
<v Speaker 1>And so profoundly important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you balance between the academic </v>

40
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.590
<v Speaker 1>things that you care about and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that we're going to talk about for</v>

41
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:04.424
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the next hour or so and just being </v>

42
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:07.634
<v Speaker 1>human because I feel like that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are having trouble dealing with </v>

43
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:10.394
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that from people that work blue </v>

44
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:14.570
<v Speaker 1>collar jobs to people that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>high level math stuff.</v>

45
00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:15.404
<v Speaker 1>I feel like people are having trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>separating like just all the noise from </v>

46
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.233
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

47
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Speaker 1>So I basically have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professionally speaking,</v>

48
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I have two hats that I wear that have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor with all that that entails,</v>

49
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>which if I only did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would keep me busy 18 hours a day.</v>

50
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>And then there is my public intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>hat that I wear,</v>

51
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the past few years.</v>

52
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I feel that a large part of my time has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been taken up by the ladder.</v>

53
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm trying to kind of reign that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

54
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So to still remain a viable voice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle of public ideas.</v>

55
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.260
<v Speaker 1>But I need to sort of go back to some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamentals,</v>

56
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.233
<v Speaker 1>the lab stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I've ever given it a given it </v>

57
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes time as you know,</v>

58
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To build an audience,</v>

59
00:02:57.801 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>to get people excited what you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

60
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of effort and so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I have the magical recipe yet,</v>

61
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>but I try to every day do a bit of both.</v>

62
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you made that shift,</v>

63
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>which probably was right around when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>met you,</v>

64
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.003
<v Speaker 1>met whatever we did on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however you connect with someone on </v>

65
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>twitter or know whatever that is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years ago or so,</v>

66
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.943
<v Speaker 1>when you made that sort of shift from </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic to someone that was going to </v>

67
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.993
<v Speaker 1>speak their mind publicly and fight with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people publicly and make videos and </v>

68
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:29.060
<v Speaker 1>interviews and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you realize how much of a,</v>

69
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.840
<v Speaker 1>not not just a time suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a,</v>

70
00:03:30.841 --> 00:03:31.610
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

71
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>an important piece of your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was going to become.</v>

72
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very much of a purist,</v>

74
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just excited by things like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

75
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:39.424
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I discovered that there's this thing </v>

76
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:42.184
<v Speaker 1>called social media that allows me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise my ideas with all sorts of </v>

77
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:46.384
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet people that I would have otherwise </v>

78
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>never meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dave Rubin and countless others,</v>

79
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>even random strangers that I get to meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>who sent me beautiful gifts and I get to</v>

80
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.274
<v Speaker 1>know them well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who selling me stuff that's personal in </v>

81
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>their lives.</v>

82
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>So I never thought that that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

83
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>but I'm amazed at the power of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium.</v>

84
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And I don't say this in an arrogant </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

85
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:05.554
<v Speaker 1>just walking down the street and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably you get this probably 10 times </v>

86
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>more than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number of people who recognize you,</v>

87
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.730
<v Speaker 1>who come up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who say they love your work,</v>

88
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:14.390
<v Speaker 1>who fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.520
<v Speaker 1>we can be on the beach and I'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped with that.</v>

90
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I can be in a bathroom and someone will </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

91
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Godfather.</v>

92
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>And so that's nothing worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Your pee against somebody,</v>

93
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.690
<v Speaker 1>the guy next to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm,</v>

94
00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

95
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at that with,</v>

96
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.990
<v Speaker 1>with a bit of humility in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

97
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible that we have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>platforms,</v>

98
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>which five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago,</v>

99
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 1>a guy like me and academia I could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>never hoped to have.</v>

100
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>And so it's been wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a blessing.</v>

101
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a real silver lining to </v>

102
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:41.704
<v Speaker 1>everything that's going on now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is people feel like everyone's </v>

103
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>dumber and fighting all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

104
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:46.834
<v Speaker 1>I'm a firm believer that most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of us want the same simple </v>

105
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.064
<v Speaker 1>things into live decent lives and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have some food and have some money </v>

106
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>and be able to go on vacation and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sex and just whatever,</v>

107
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever those basics are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the silver lining,</v>

108
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:00.544
<v Speaker 1>while it sounds so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously if people are recognizing </v>

109
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>you and rewarding you for the work you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

110
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 1>it shows that there is an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirst stays.</v>

111
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not being given to you by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media,</v>

112
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>but it shows that it's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

113
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows like that are not mainstream.</v>

114
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.753
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think eventually this will be the </v>

115
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:17.930
<v Speaker 1>mainstream.</v>

116
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

117
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 1>it amazes me how the mainstream media </v>
<v Speaker 1>has sort of doubled down,</v>

118
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

119
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:26.210
<v Speaker 1>to use a term that we might talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

120
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:27.044
<v Speaker 1>had ostrich logic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then sand and refuse to sort of </v>

121
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>recognize some of the dynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A look,</v>

122
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 1>anything that promotes more discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>is great.</v>

123
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I only wish that people were sometimes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit nicer,</v>

124
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.820
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps they haven't evolved to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicer,</v>

125
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be your next book.</v>

126
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's your mission of evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

127
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

128
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>we both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time do this,</v>

129
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're able to brush it off,</v>

130
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a toll.</v>

131
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:59.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading about your,</v>

132
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my weight,</v>

133
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.950
<v Speaker 1>my Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my.</v>

134
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just endless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

135
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 1>a nasty things that are written about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

136
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.133
<v Speaker 1>I wish people would recognize that both </v>
<v Speaker 1>of us and many of us will play in this </v>

137
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>marketplace of idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really doing it with pure research,</v>

138
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>pure reasons to contribute to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

139
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 1>And if people could learn to be a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicer,</v>

140
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>we would all be richer for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish it,</v>

142
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.930
<v Speaker 1>but I don't sense that coming down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pike.</v>

143
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.853
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna we're gonna do a lot of </v>

144
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:29.084
<v Speaker 1>stuff here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think just first because it </v>

145
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>couches everything else on the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech front,</v>

146
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>you've become one of the few people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know of,</v>

147
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>at least on the public side in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really fighting the free speech</v>

148
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:40.431
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

149
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>the real high profile guy also is Jordan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>

150
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.673
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also at the academic level of </v>

151
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

152
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 1>what is happening in Canada right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

153
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:51.524
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems pretty scary actually when you </v>

154
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>hear some of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

155
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Canada I think is desperately trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the number one,</v>

156
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.703
<v Speaker 1>a social justice warrior country in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that's trying to catch up to </v>

157
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:03.884
<v Speaker 1>Germany and Sweden and part because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a prime minister who very much a </v>

158
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 1>epitomizes those positions.</v>

159
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.920
<v Speaker 1>And so the endless tsunami of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>types of positions are difficult to keep</v>

160
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned earlier that,</v>

161
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.403
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had appeared in front of the Canadian </v>

162
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Senate to testify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I could mention this very briefly.</v>

163
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.783
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're here to tell me what you </v>

164
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:24.824
<v Speaker 1>think don't even have this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill is a bill that has now since </v>

165
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:30.044
<v Speaker 1>passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both Jordan Peterson and I are in </v>

166
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>separate sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been asked to appear to discuss some</v>

167
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:37.754
<v Speaker 1>of our concerns with the bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bill basically refers to </v>

168
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:40.604
<v Speaker 1>incorporating gender identity and gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression within hate crime laws that </v>

169
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 1>if you target someone based on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity or gender expression,</v>

170
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.770
<v Speaker 1>then it's hateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I guess the penalty,</v>

171
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.633
<v Speaker 1>the penalty would be ratcheted up a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I appeared in front of the Canadian </v>

172
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.773
<v Speaker 1>Senate to basically argue that the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was worded is so vague and </v>

173
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 1>potentially so dangerous that literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that I teach in my evolutionary</v>

174
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:07.750
<v Speaker 1>psychology courses could be construed as</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

175
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>systemic violence.</v>

176
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.853
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason why I say quotes because </v>

177
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:12.914
<v Speaker 1>those are terms that a harvard pamphlet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the LGBTQ office at Harvard had put out </v>

178
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:22.601
<v Speaker 1>a pamphlet where they argued that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who support a quilt,</v>

179
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>fixed binaries and biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentialism fixed binaries is male,</v>

180
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:27.951
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>

181
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:28.784
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A biological essentialism is arguing </v>

182
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:31.304
<v Speaker 1>that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>biological realities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved realities,</v>

184
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.903
<v Speaker 1>innate sex differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you promulgate these types of </v>

185
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:40.820
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are actually engaging in quote Trans</v>

186
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 1>phobic systemic violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

187
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.660
<v Speaker 1>that's not allegorical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical.</v>

188
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>You literally are being transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really violent,</v>

189
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.733
<v Speaker 1>and so I argued that anything that I say</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my course when I walk into my course </v>

190
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:52.214
<v Speaker 1>and introduced the concept of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection and how sex specific traits </v>

191
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:56.664
<v Speaker 1>evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I only use words like male and </v>

192
00:08:58.771 --> 00:08:59.604
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't refer to the non binary and non </v>

193
00:09:01.181 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 1>gender and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So any person in the room could say,</v>

194
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:05.364
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a 13 week course you never once </v>

195
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 1>recognized my personhood.</v>

196
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.770
<v Speaker 1>You're engaging in Trans phobic systemic</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

197
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.843
<v Speaker 1>The answer to this very sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a presentation that I gave was that one </v>

198
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.584
<v Speaker 1>of the Canadian senators accused me of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being pro genocide and where did that </v>

199
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.693
<v Speaker 1>come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because apparently the fact that I was </v>

200
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:29.481
<v Speaker 1>not supporting the bill somehow through </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Gargantuan leap of logic,</v>

201
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to feather and tar or </v>

202
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:34.074
<v Speaker 1>transgender people and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I specifically argued that all people </v>

203
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:38.640
<v Speaker 1>deserve to be treated equally under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

204
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have to uniquely celebrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your personhood,</v>

205
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.283
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a distinction between treating </v>

206
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:45.894
<v Speaker 1>you as an equal member of society and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having to go an extra mile to uniquely </v>

207
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 1>celebrate your personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you another example.</v>

208
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Canada wanted to now create a gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutral society.</v>

209
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 1>So the idea being that the marker male </v>
<v Speaker 1>or female,</v>

210
00:09:58.981 --> 00:09:59.814
<v Speaker 1>say on official government documents </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be removed because that small </v>

211
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 1>percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than one percent,</v>

212
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:06.564
<v Speaker 1>substantially less than one percent who </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider themselves non-gendered or </v>

213
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:10.224
<v Speaker 1>nonbinary.</v>

214
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 1>We are going to feel marginalized by </v>
<v Speaker 1>having to write male or female.</v>

215
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.713
<v Speaker 1>So 99 point nine percent of a population</v>
<v Speaker 1>should lose in identifying marker that </v>

216
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 1>is part of their personhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a male.</v>

217
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I have a child that's mail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a daughter that's female.</v>

218
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.583
<v Speaker 1>I'm married to a woman that's female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things should be removed </v>

219
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 1>because someone might be marginalized by</v>
<v Speaker 1>that biological reality.</v>

220
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 1>It's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for someone like you that,</v>

221
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.183
<v Speaker 1>that builds in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly that deal in the </v>

222
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:43.280
<v Speaker 1>realm of science and you have to base </v>
<v Speaker 1>things on fact,</v>

223
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.260
<v Speaker 1>this is actually a direct assault on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a certain way.</v>

224
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in,</v>

225
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.500
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>important societal issue,</v>

226
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:50.334
<v Speaker 1>but really it's rational self interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be able to do your job that </v>

227
00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:53.844
<v Speaker 1>you have been trained to do at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest level without having outside </v>

228
00:10:57.871 --> 00:10:58.210
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

229
00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 1>So when you finished up that talk over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

230
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 1>did you feel better or worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the course of it?</v>

231
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I felt better and that at least my </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions were on record.</v>

232
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any a sense that the bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be defeated.</v>

233
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.013
<v Speaker 1>I felt very strongly that it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately pass just because of the </v>

234
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Speaker 1>reality of the dynamics of the political</v>
<v Speaker 1>system there.</v>

235
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.810
<v Speaker 1>But at least I knew that Jordan had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard.</v>

236
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't been heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's officially on record.</v>

237
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.983
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in that sense I felt I had done my </v>

238
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civic duty,</v>

239
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.040
<v Speaker 1>but I have no illusions that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would help sway the vote.</v>

240
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I knew that we will ultimately lose the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>

241
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>So when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see online,</v>

242
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:37.141
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

243
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 1>you guys are overestimating when someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>says racist or bigoted or homophobia,</v>

244
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of this stuff.</v>

245
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 1>This really goes to show why these are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

246
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.610
<v Speaker 1>We're not just making up this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fight,</v>

247
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.463
<v Speaker 1>forget what people are saying online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fight is now starting to codify </v>

248
00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 1>things into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely right.</v>

249
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nevermind law.</v>

250
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:57.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

251
00:11:57.491 --> 00:11:58.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take these extreme examples.</v>

252
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have Bret Weinstein on this show.</v>

253
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:01.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he not a real person who's </v>

254
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.453
<v Speaker 1>experienced real death threats?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people always think that we're in in </v>

255
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:07.864
<v Speaker 1>a sense engaging in an exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated narrative by pointing to </v>

256
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 1>these extreme cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is extreme today,</v>

257
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.733
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow becomes mundane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is why canaries in the coal </v>

258
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.660
<v Speaker 1>mine stand up and sing and warn people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

259
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.370
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently people don't want to listen.</v>

260
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever think that it's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda sucky to be someone that sees</v>

261
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:31.460
<v Speaker 1>something a little bit early?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's sometimes like,</v>

262
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.190
<v Speaker 1>it's great at a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

263
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.023
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what makes people care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what you're saying because they </v>

264
00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:37.450
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a twinge of,</v>

265
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:38.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's onto something.</v>

266
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 1>But like when I sat here with Brett and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he at the time,</v>

267
00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he identifies as now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the time he was saying I'm a,</v>

268
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

269
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

270
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.180
<v Speaker 1>deeply I think deeply committed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive,</v>

271
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now know that he,</v>

272
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.280
<v Speaker 1>at least I don't want to speak for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically it said,</v>

273
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the progressive train has left him or he</v>

274
00:12:58.601 --> 00:13:02.320
<v Speaker 1>grew up or perhaps I don't know that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say it so specifically.</v>

275
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I knew it as I was sitting here with</v>

276
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:06.940
<v Speaker 1>him and he was saying how he was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this deep progressive.</v>

277
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.043
<v Speaker 1>I knew that it was just a matter of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month or two months or whatever before </v>

278
00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 1>he'd see the same thing that we've all </v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about for that long.</v>

279
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:18.040
<v Speaker 1>So there's like a joy and also like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression in that I think,</v>

280
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife often tells me that I'm an avant</v>

281
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 1>garde both and my scientific career and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my public engagements,</v>

282
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in part because I do see </v>
<v Speaker 1>these trends early,</v>

283
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 1>but also because I have the courage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak about them.</v>

284
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 1>You and I both see them at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

285
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.143
<v Speaker 1>but if I only have the courage to say it</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I appear as though I'm the avant </v>

286
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:37.414
<v Speaker 1>garde guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you saw the same pattern but </v>

287
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:39.394
<v Speaker 1>were too afraid to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in a sense it's a unique </v>

288
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 1>combination of both seeing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns early enough,</v>

289
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.100
<v Speaker 1>but then having the courage to voice my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

290
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.173
<v Speaker 1>And of course that ultimately and </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia is not something contrary to </v>

291
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 1>what you might think is not something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's desired.</v>

292
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Herd mentality is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we say in French dirty girl.</v>

293
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the official way to be.</v>

294
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Don't cause too much waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want trouble here.</v>

295
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.203
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is so the reverse of what true </v>

296
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of knowledge is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people say that,</v>

297
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll also hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

298
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:10.234
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are a overblowing what's </v>

299
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:12.274
<v Speaker 1>happening on college campuses or your </v>
<v Speaker 1>overblowing that there isn't enough </v>

300
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:17.140
<v Speaker 1>diversity of thought there as someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's on college campuses,</v>

301
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:17.974
<v Speaker 1>as someone that has testified about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening there and as someone </v>

302
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:23.830
<v Speaker 1>that knows plenty of academics in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Canada and the United States,</v>

303
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Speaker 1>are we overblowing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>

304
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.363
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to issues like political </v>

305
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 1>matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

306
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 1>how people make pronouncements about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>given religion or they or not,</v>

307
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.870
<v Speaker 1>there is APP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody walks to the exact same beat.</v>

308
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

309
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I could just use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

310
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:43.450
<v Speaker 1>anecdotal evidence or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I could cite actual studies,</v>

311
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 1>but let's go with anecdotal evidence.</v>

312
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think I might've mentioned this </v>
<v Speaker 1>before on the show.</v>

313
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:50.530
<v Speaker 1>If you just go to my personal facebook </v>
<v Speaker 1>page,</v>

314
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:51.603
<v Speaker 1>you never see anyone and I've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of academic friends on my </v>

315
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:55.784
<v Speaker 1>personal facebook page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a single person has ever uttered </v>

316
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.230
<v Speaker 1>deposition regarding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say trump,</v>

317
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.333
<v Speaker 1>that I would construe as surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising in the sense that they might </v>

318
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 1>say something that is positive of him or</v>
<v Speaker 1>favorable,</v>

319
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 1>or why someone might have voted for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single academic friend that I have</v>

320
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.350
<v Speaker 1>apes the identical same position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's simply not possible,</v>

321
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:17.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within any group of people,</v>

322
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 1>you would expect some diversity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

323
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently there isn't.</v>

324
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.250
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about trump a little bit.</v>

325
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be clear that right now,</v>

326
00:15:24.941 --> 00:15:25.774
<v Speaker 1>as we tape this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to go off the grid for a </v>

327
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:28.424
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is going up about 12 or 13 days </v>

328
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.240
<v Speaker 1>after we're taping this.</v>

329
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.140
<v Speaker 1>So in the way that we live these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump could have done anything by then,</v>

330
00:15:36.141 --> 00:15:39.790
<v Speaker 1>the impeachment proceedings could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been regarding the monarchy,</v>

331
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.633
<v Speaker 1>could've started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell knows what's going to </v>

332
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as we tape this on,</v>

333
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 1>what's today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>July 28th,</v>

334
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>

335
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've been basically pretty </v>

336
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:55.340
<v Speaker 1>fair on trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't sense that you love the guy.</v>

337
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.193
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't sense that you're have a </v>

338
00:15:57.621 --> 00:16:00.230
<v Speaker 1>deranged hatred of the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a fair estimation?</v>

339
00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

340
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.780
<v Speaker 1>And usually when I've come out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>support of trump,</v>

341
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.360
<v Speaker 1>that's not usually what I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

342
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:09.194
<v Speaker 1>I have offered very a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological reasons why someone might </v>

343
00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:16.850
<v Speaker 1>vote for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

344
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:17.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

345
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:18.723
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may remember this in one of my </v>

346
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.743
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was with Sam Harris or I </v>

347
00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:23.084
<v Speaker 1>explained the actual decision rule that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone might use in arriving at a </v>

348
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.150
<v Speaker 1>decision to vote for trump.</v>

349
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 1>And I'll just repeat it for here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're,</v>

350
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.970
<v Speaker 1>when you're choosing between two multi </v>
<v Speaker 1>attribute products,</v>

351
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:39.660
<v Speaker 1>two cars to people to hire two mates to </v>
<v Speaker 1>marry their,</v>

352
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.573
<v Speaker 1>each defined by many attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are many decision rules that I </v>

353
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:43.634
<v Speaker 1>could use in deciding whether to choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative ar alternative be one of </v>

354
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 1>these decision rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the lexical graphic rule,</v>

355
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.483
<v Speaker 1>which basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your most important attribute to </v>

356
00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:52.904
<v Speaker 1>you and choose the alternative that </v>
<v Speaker 1>scores higher on that most important </v>

357
00:16:56.721 --> 00:16:58.340
<v Speaker 1>attribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing you look at.</v>

358
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.580
<v Speaker 1>So in the case of applying that rule to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

359
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 1>if let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my most important attribute,</v>

360
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:07.400
<v Speaker 1>my lexical graphic rule attribute is </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>

361
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.773
<v Speaker 1>and rightly or wrongly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I viewed that trump scores better on </v>

362
00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:13.850
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I use that rule,</v>

363
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.863
<v Speaker 1>I will choose trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though if I had looked at all of </v>

364
00:17:17.361 --> 00:17:19.520
<v Speaker 1>the attributes of defining trump and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton,</v>

365
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I might've ended up choosing Clinton.</v>

366
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 1>So as someone who studies psychology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision making,</v>

367
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.213
<v Speaker 1>there are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear cognitive processes that we </v>

368
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:28.094
<v Speaker 1>could use to explain why a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable person might end up choosing </v>

369
00:17:31.161 --> 00:17:31.971
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

370
00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:35.210
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I jokingly say on twitter,</v>

371
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.280
<v Speaker 1>that I have posters of trump and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>bedroom.</v>

372
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:38.383
<v Speaker 1>It simply means that as someone who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this passionate who's studying it from </v>

373
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 1>my Canadian context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a behavioral decision theorists,</v>

374
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I could understand why people would vote</v>
<v Speaker 1>for trump.</v>

375
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Just uttering that the amount of hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you get and the amount of,</v>

376
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ostracizing that happens within academia</v>

377
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 1>because you dare say something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to support trump.</v>

378
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.500
<v Speaker 1>It means craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that do you think is sort of</v>

379
00:18:01.501 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 1>the elite Ism of academia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

380
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:05.604
<v Speaker 1>your saying something that's that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>using your the discipline that you have </v>

381
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.390
<v Speaker 1>to give this idea of why people may have</v>
<v Speaker 1>voted for trump,</v>

382
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:17.190
<v Speaker 1>so you're separating sort of the the Gad</v>
<v Speaker 1>human part you're saying this is.</v>

383
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.113
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think is happening based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on information that I have versus other </v>

384
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:21.834
<v Speaker 1>academics that because they want to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to all the parties with the academics </v>

385
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:25.314
<v Speaker 1>and all of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trump is sort of the reverse </v>

386
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:31.380
<v Speaker 1>academic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the idea that they could say anything</v>

387
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:32.214
<v Speaker 1>nice about the person who's the reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who speaks in such ridiculous speech </v>

388
00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:39.060
<v Speaker 1>patterns and says so many over the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and tweets like a madman,</v>

389
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.760
<v Speaker 1>that somehow that would all be thrust </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon them.</v>

390
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.613
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that I would frame exactly what </v>

391
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:47.550
<v Speaker 1>you said as the elitist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the academics,</v>

392
00:18:47.551 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 1>the ivory tower folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>

393
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:55.190
<v Speaker 1>They viewed trump as a fatal attack on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their sense of aesthetics.</v>

394
00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.530
<v Speaker 1>It's he is an injury to their aesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way he speaks,</v>

395
00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 1>the way he annunciates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he shakes hands.</v>

396
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.513
<v Speaker 1>Everything about him as an affront to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hardiness and therefore there's </v>

397
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.430
<v Speaker 1>this visceral hate of him at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic level.</v>

398
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 1>He's grotesque,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an older,</v>

399
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.663
<v Speaker 1>he's a buffoon and I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this position and unstated amongst some </v>

400
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:26.760
<v Speaker 1>of our common friends where I typically </v>
<v Speaker 1>would consider those to be those climate</v>

401
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 1>friends to be very sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This passion of thinkers,</v>

402
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.283
<v Speaker 1>but they've succumbed to that trap where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are simply unable to stomach the </v>

403
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:38.310
<v Speaker 1>possibility that this person could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the highest office.</v>

404
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it really is that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They despise his sense of aesthetics.</v>

405
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:43.763
<v Speaker 1>So I sent that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your position on him is sort of where </v>

406
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 1>mine is in that forgetting what I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about him personally and again,</v>

407
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I can say the phrase moral center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I bring them up again,</v>

408
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.983
<v Speaker 1>don't know what his moral center is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still confused as whether he's </v>

409
00:19:57.301 --> 00:19:58.134
<v Speaker 1>waking up everyday and making all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions as they come on the flight or </v>

410
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 1>if there's a grand plan or any of that.</v>

411
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.743
<v Speaker 1>But the part that I like is the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the media has taken it on the Chin </v>

412
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:07.644
<v Speaker 1>and basically been blown apart and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is what we needed in this </v>

413
00:20:10.411 --> 00:20:11.880
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

414
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I sent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of with me on.</v>

415
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.333
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look to use a cliche that I don't </v>

416
00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:18.690
<v Speaker 1>particularly like from sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>buzzwords of business.</v>

417
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.430
<v Speaker 1>He is a disruptor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

418
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.443
<v Speaker 1>To the extent that you wanted someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because they all loved </v>

419
00:20:24.321 --> 00:20:25.410
<v Speaker 1>disrupters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they,</v>

420
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.860
<v Speaker 1>every now and again you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>a disruptor you don't like,</v>

421
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

422
00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 1>he's the structure in every possible way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could conceive of that term.</v>

423
00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's from outside the political class.</v>

424
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:37.920
<v Speaker 1>He's never held political office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He speaks differently from them.</v>

425
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:40.140
<v Speaker 1>He's a brawler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a real estate guy.</v>

426
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

427
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.873
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his language pattern is that of a thug </v>

428
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.600
<v Speaker 1>in grade eight.</v>

429
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.063
<v Speaker 1>He is somewhat buffoonish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in every possible way that we could </v>

430
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 1>think of what they aspire to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama,</v>

431
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.300
<v Speaker 1>he's the Anti Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama is sophisticated.</v>

432
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 1>These majestic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great orator.</v>

433
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

434
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 1>those are superficial cues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

435
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.891
<v Speaker 1>Typically when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

436
00:21:04.891 --> 00:21:06.670
<v Speaker 1>when we look at the psychology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>persuasion,</v>

437
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:09.190
<v Speaker 1>we look at substantive cues or cosmetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

438
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:10.024
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How tall you are is something that </v>

439
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:13.780
<v Speaker 1>people use when they judge your </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership qualities,</v>

440
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:16.290
<v Speaker 1>but if objectively it shouldn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

441
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.463
<v Speaker 1>And so in a similar manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he might speak in a way </v>

442
00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:21.124
<v Speaker 1>that is clearly much more buffoonish </v>
<v Speaker 1>than say Barack Obama doesn't </v>

443
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 1>necessarily speak to whether you </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate his policies or not.</v>

444
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the part that I think is </v>

445
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 1>interesting because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

446
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're taping this about two weeks before</v>

447
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:33.244
<v Speaker 1>it's going to air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who the hell knows what's going to </v>

448
00:21:35.321 --> 00:21:35.590
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

449
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 1>But even just in the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

450
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:38.480
<v Speaker 1>there was this thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

451
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.400
<v Speaker 1>with scar moochy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the recording and you know,</v>

452
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:44.920
<v Speaker 1>bannon wants to suck his own cock and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

453
00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:45.161
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

454
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 1>All this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's freaking out.</v>

455
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at twitter and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists,</v>

456
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:49.804
<v Speaker 1>all the lefties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's freaking out over the </v>

457
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 1>language and how can they talk like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

458
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.980
<v Speaker 1>And all I was thinking was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

459
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess in some perfect world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't exist.</v>

460
00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I wish that government officials would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a little more professional,</v>

461
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.630
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that Obama people and Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that and Clinton before that,</v>

462
00:22:05.631 --> 00:22:08.710
<v Speaker 1>and then you can go back forever </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally go back to George Washington,</v>

463
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:13.890
<v Speaker 1>the idea that they didn't speak it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>blue language and say nasty things about</v>

464
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:15.124
<v Speaker 1>each other and all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the infighting and back to the idea </v>

465
00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:21.770
<v Speaker 1>that this has just appeared now is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrageous.</v>

466
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.370
<v Speaker 1>It's just fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full outrage.</v>

467
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:25.204
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to maintain the facade of </v>

468
00:22:27.371 --> 00:22:28.660
<v Speaker 1>the ivory tower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

469
00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:32.920
<v Speaker 1>This highfalutin way of Bologna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't a Nixon who,</v>

470
00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:35.380
<v Speaker 1>when you look at his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his transcripts,</v>

471
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.560
<v Speaker 1>every second word that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

472
00:22:38.561 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 1>these guys are not a Oxford professors </v>
<v Speaker 1>of philosophy.</v>

473
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.930
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want them to be.</v>

474
00:22:43.931 --> 00:22:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's also the irony.</v>

475
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like when Bill Clinton said I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhale,</v>

476
00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:49.504
<v Speaker 1>it was like you could admit you inhale </v>
<v Speaker 1>or when Barack Obama gets did say he </v>

477
00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:54.490
<v Speaker 1>inhaled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like the idea that we have to</v>

478
00:22:54.491 --> 00:22:57.400
<v Speaker 1>feel guilty about all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're all humans,</v>

479
00:22:57.401 --> 00:23:00.580
<v Speaker 1>we curse some of us drink or smoke pot </v>
<v Speaker 1>or do some other shit.</v>

480
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:01.743
<v Speaker 1>And just to mention a couple of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities that I think trump does have </v>

481
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.020
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

482
00:23:08.021 --> 00:23:10.300
<v Speaker 1>when you face a lot of conflicts there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some research,</v>

483
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who it's by.</v>

484
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's made by Gregory at Texas </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tech,</v>

485
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.673
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked at what types of leaders do </v>

486
00:23:17.441 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 1>people wish to elect as a function of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>

487
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Is there for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war or not,</v>

488
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:23.883
<v Speaker 1>and so our preference for a particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of leadership style changes as a </v>

489
00:23:27.011 --> 00:23:29.080
<v Speaker 1>function of the environment as you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect.</v>

490
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that we now face a lot of </v>

491
00:23:31.301 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 1>chaos with terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the immigration problems and so on.</v>

492
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I would have predicted that someone like</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

493
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:41.740
<v Speaker 1>a guy who appears to be a bit reckless </v>
<v Speaker 1>of periods to be as though,</v>

494
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.733
<v Speaker 1>am I going to press the Red Button?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I not going to press it even though </v>

495
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.820
<v Speaker 1>he's not going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that he,</v>

496
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.803
<v Speaker 1>he exudes those types of signals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to a lot of people that is </v>

497
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:51.614
<v Speaker 1>equality because you have very dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys in the neighborhood who might feel </v>

498
00:23:55.881 --> 00:23:56.714
<v Speaker 1>intimidated by someone who appears to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a risk taker who appears to be a </v>

499
00:23:59.991 --> 00:24:01.280
<v Speaker 1>brawler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so in that sense,</v>

500
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.533
<v Speaker 1>here's another psychological reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people might have latched onto </v>

501
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:05.684
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it also goes to show why when Obama </v>

502
00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:08.984
<v Speaker 1>or Hillary wouldn't say radical Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>terror or whatever phrase that you </v>

503
00:24:12.141 --> 00:24:15.570
<v Speaker 1>wanted to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a and trump would just say anything,</v>

504
00:24:15.571 --> 00:24:17.480
<v Speaker 1>and she said trump was just given them </v>
<v Speaker 1>the red meat.</v>

505
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.890
<v Speaker 1>They were going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me something.</v>

506
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Give me something that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then trump says something.</v>

507
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:23.840
<v Speaker 1>It's probably over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're going,</v>

508
00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least it's something exactly right.</v>

509
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.433
<v Speaker 1>I should mention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that we both tentatively agreed </v>

510
00:24:29.891 --> 00:24:31.690
<v Speaker 1>that talked much about Islam before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

511
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.260
<v Speaker 1>but let me just mention one or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

512
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.843
<v Speaker 1>I think it is a misnomer to constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with qualifiers before the word </v>

513
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Islam and let me explain why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is not Islam,</v>

514
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:44.900
<v Speaker 1>there is not Islamism Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam as part of Islam.</v>

515
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.213
<v Speaker 1>Islam as a set of codifying ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a spiritual element and it has a </v>

516
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:54.060
<v Speaker 1>political element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That political element is Islam.</v>

517
00:24:54.061 --> 00:24:54.894
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which now people are </v>

518
00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Speaker 1>talking about Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam is.</v>

519
00:24:57.501 --> 00:24:57.940
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

520
00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:58.773
<v Speaker 1>it's something that is outside of Islam </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I understand the reason why people </v>

521
00:25:02.481 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 1>want to do this.</v>

522
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.913
<v Speaker 1>It's because they feel as though it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>two Gauche to frontally attacker </v>

523
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.113
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you attack something that has </v>

524
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.970
<v Speaker 1>magically ism at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

525
00:25:11.971 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

526
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.320
<v Speaker 1>If you attack Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not okay,</v>

527
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.453
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is if we're truly going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a serious and honest </v>

528
00:25:18.711 --> 00:25:19.544
<v Speaker 1>conversation about this topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to recognize that it's not </v>

529
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:22.970
<v Speaker 1>radical Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not Islam Islam.</v>

530
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:23.804
<v Speaker 1>It's not militant violent extremism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and every other permutation of a </v>

531
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:30.170
<v Speaker 1>euphemism that you come up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Islam.</v>

532
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.033
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people choose to practice a </v>

533
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.723
<v Speaker 1>cafeteria version of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pick the parts that they like and </v>

534
00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:38.144
<v Speaker 1>they ignore the endless parts that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like and that becomes their </v>

535
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:43.850
<v Speaker 1>personal relationship with Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't end that,</v>

536
00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:45.470
<v Speaker 1>but most people do that with most </v>
<v Speaker 1>religions.</v>

537
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Most people do that with most </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

538
00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.950
<v Speaker 1>You and I and everybody else don't stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>up worrying about seventh day adventist,</v>

539
00:25:50.951 --> 00:25:51.784
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the extent that Islam is now on the </v>

540
00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:56.210
<v Speaker 1>radar and we have to talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

541
00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.530
<v Speaker 1>we have to stop trying to give a free </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass to Islam,</v>

542
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.450
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem is something else.</v>

543
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Some variant of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam is codified in the Koran.</v>

544
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.200
<v Speaker 1>It's called the fight in the Heidi's </v>
<v Speaker 1>score of filing the Sierra,</v>

545
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.540
<v Speaker 1>the biography of Muhammad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

546
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.613
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a way that I could read those </v>

547
00:26:14.091 --> 00:26:17.960
<v Speaker 1>techs and come up with a message of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brotherly love and love for Jews?</v>

548
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not Islam.</v>

549
00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical Islam that Islam.</v>

550
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say this,</v>

551
00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I also recognize that 95 percent of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims are just as nice as anybody that</v>

552
00:26:30.921 --> 00:26:31.754
<v Speaker 1>you could hope to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not because they practice a </v>

553
00:26:33.801 --> 00:26:37.220
<v Speaker 1>gentle version of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>codified in some other set of tax.</v>

554
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:38.263
<v Speaker 1>That's because they're decent human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings will decide to like the rest of </v>

555
00:26:41.031 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 1>us pick and choose which parts apply to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their daily lives and not.</v>

556
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 1>So we have to be very careful and honest</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

557
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.263
<v Speaker 1>And I hope that at some point soon a </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater number of our common friends </v>

558
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 1>will actually hear what I'm saying now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

559
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:55.704
<v Speaker 1>for the record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just mentioned that we said </v>

560
00:26:56.731 --> 00:26:58.110
<v Speaker 1>we were going to talk about that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Islam.</v>

561
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not because we're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we both,</v>

562
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.013
<v Speaker 1>we both talked about it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we realized that we wanted to get </v>

563
00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:04.570
<v Speaker 1>more into some science stuff and plenty </v>
<v Speaker 1>of other stuff.</v>

564
00:27:04.571 --> 00:27:05.404
<v Speaker 1>So I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be clear because </v>

565
00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:07.520
<v Speaker 1>otherwise people are combined and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just see they're,</v>

566
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.440
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

567
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.400
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very quickly on that though.</v>

568
00:27:11.401 --> 00:27:13.570
<v Speaker 1>So you are writing a new book right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

569
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.500
<v Speaker 1>which deals with this and deals with </v>
<v Speaker 1>ostrich parasitic syndrome.</v>

570
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.423
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very quickly for those that don't </v>

571
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 1>know what o p,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s is,</v>

572
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:24.250
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about that and then I won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about the book and then we'll move.</v>

573
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:24.841
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

574
00:27:24.841 --> 00:27:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for asking.</v>

575
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.850
<v Speaker 1>So let me sort of step back and give </v>
<v Speaker 1>some some analogies.</v>

576
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.833
<v Speaker 1>So if you look in the animal kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many cases where you have </v>

577
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.073
<v Speaker 1>brain worms or pathogens that enter the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain of a particular species and it </v>

578
00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:41.490
<v Speaker 1>renders that species zombified.</v>

579
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So example,</v>

580
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.123
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mouse can be infected by a particular </v>

581
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.010
<v Speaker 1>pathogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It loses its innate fear of cats.</v>

582
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.903
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good thing if you're a mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another type of brain warm that </v>

583
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.660
<v Speaker 1>attacks the brains of ungulates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say moose or elk or deer,</v>

584
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.823
<v Speaker 1>and they become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become completely zombified where </v>

585
00:28:00.631 --> 00:28:01.464
<v Speaker 1>they just circle and the same in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same spot until these looming predators </v>

586
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:05.620
<v Speaker 1>come and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

587
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Think of another example of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffers from Anorexia nervosa.</v>

588
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.393
<v Speaker 1>Right there they're thinking now has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become so disordered that even though </v>

589
00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:14.544
<v Speaker 1>they only weigh 70 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at themselves in the mirror </v>

590
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.113
<v Speaker 1>and they genuinely think that there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They remain grotesquely obese and they </v>

591
00:28:20.641 --> 00:28:21.900
<v Speaker 1>need to lose a bit more weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

592
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:22.943
<v Speaker 1>So there are all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are all sorts of analogies where </v>

593
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.353
<v Speaker 1>whether it be in the human context or </v>
<v Speaker 1>with other species where our brain </v>

594
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:35.100
<v Speaker 1>become hijacked by either disordered </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking or literally a pathogen.</v>

595
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.173
<v Speaker 1>So I took these ideas and I argued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what could explain the collective </v>

596
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:39.564
<v Speaker 1>psychosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collective departure from reason </v>

597
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.773
<v Speaker 1>that we see being exhibited in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only as related to Islam but as </v>

598
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:49.290
<v Speaker 1>relating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

599
00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:52.800
<v Speaker 1>to the negation of the idea that humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>are biological beings,</v>

600
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.560
<v Speaker 1>that there are sex differences that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

601
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.860
<v Speaker 1>So this ostrich person x syndrome is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only applicable to Islam,</v>

602
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.900
<v Speaker 1>and so that's how I came up with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>term to to,</v>

603
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.993
<v Speaker 1>to use the metaphor of the Australia </v>
<v Speaker 1>buries his head even though it doesn't </v>

604
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.163
<v Speaker 1>really do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an apt metaphor of the denial </v>

605
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:10.920
<v Speaker 1>of reliance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

606
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.760
<v Speaker 1>parasitic in that a genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive sizes,</v>

607
00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.140
<v Speaker 1>your brain and you lose your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

608
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.273
<v Speaker 1>Now I specifically apply it to Islam </v>
<v Speaker 1>because typically the ostriches that </v>

609
00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:22.674
<v Speaker 1>succumb to ops got engage in all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cognitive distortions to protect </v>

610
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:27.624
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ironically you're talking about </v>

611
00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:31.200
<v Speaker 1>people that are not Muslim for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

612
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:31.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

613
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

614
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.713
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many of the ops suffers will end up </v>

615
00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:39.180
<v Speaker 1>being non Muslims who because they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been pressurized by ops,</v>

616
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.640
<v Speaker 1>will come up with all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disordered thinking to defend Islam.</v>

617
00:29:42.641 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I give many,</v>

618
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:49.081
<v Speaker 1>many such examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I take this idea and it's part of my</v>

619
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:50.044
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the book is tentatively titled Death </v>

620
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Of the West by a thousand cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the idea that we,</v>

621
00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:00.660
<v Speaker 1>we are currently facing this opioid </v>
<v Speaker 1>epidemic because of a perfect confluence</v>

622
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.000
<v Speaker 1>of full intellectual movements that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>porosities our brains,</v>

623
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:10.060
<v Speaker 1>so it's not one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's radical feminism,</v>

624
00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:13.090
<v Speaker 1>it's identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cultural and moral relativism.</v>

625
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.073
<v Speaker 1>It's postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of which uses its own machinery to </v>

626
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.960
<v Speaker 1>personalize our brain to move away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

627
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:23.913
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reject the idea that there's male and </v>

628
00:30:25.481 --> 00:30:26.320
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

629
00:30:26.321 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biologists and evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists don't.</v>

630
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:29.523
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reject that they are an eight sex </v>

631
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:31.300
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

632
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.550
<v Speaker 1>While the average three year old knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is such a thing,</v>

633
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I reject that there's any link between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam and any terrorism.</v>

634
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Islam is peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

635
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.240
<v Speaker 1>So how did we lead to this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we we lead with?</v>

636
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.103
<v Speaker 1>We were led to this by 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years of these movements chipping </v>

637
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:48.544
<v Speaker 1>away at our commitment to reason and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hence death of the West by a thousand </v>

638
00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:53.764
<v Speaker 1>cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was the failure of the side of </v>

639
00:30:55.631 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 1>reason then for the last 40 or 50 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did the people that were reasonable</v>

640
00:31:00.251 --> 00:31:01.084
<v Speaker 1>that were sensible and trying to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with things honestly and see the world </v>

641
00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:05.500
<v Speaker 1>as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not how they wanted it to be,</v>

642
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.760
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did they fail?</v>

643
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

644
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.510
<v Speaker 1>so if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I speak in the academic ecosystem,</v>

645
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I think the fact that we tolerated </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

646
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.740
<v Speaker 1>these affront to human decency and human</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason like postmodernism to exist,</v>

647
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.500
<v Speaker 1>it really came from a place of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

648
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 1>we have to tolerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case the intolerable,</v>

649
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.373
<v Speaker 1>intolerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that nothing could be further from </v>

650
00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 1>being anti scientific than </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism.</v>

651
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.573
<v Speaker 1>Postmodernism say there are no objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>truths other than of course the one </v>

652
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:37.024
<v Speaker 1>truth that there are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really got to be exactly so </v>

653
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.430
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and all of its endless </v>
<v Speaker 1>footprints,</v>

654
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:44.630
<v Speaker 1>profundity and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

655
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.493
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full nonsense is really a direct attack </v>

656
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.590
<v Speaker 1>on science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

657
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:51.573
<v Speaker 1>Science presumes that there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal regularities that we're going </v>

658
00:31:55.421 --> 00:31:58.060
<v Speaker 1>to use the scientific method to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>better understand.</v>

659
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if now a bunch of nihilists come</v>

660
00:32:01.481 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 1>along who say there is no such thing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

661
00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.800
<v Speaker 1>There is no such thing as objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

662
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that chips away at the reason why we all</v>

663
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:11.800
<v Speaker 1>exist in science to try to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

664
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:15.310
<v Speaker 1>but how would academia academia fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>that properly?</v>

665
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:17.810
<v Speaker 1>If the idea is we have to battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

666
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I know we both believe in the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

667
00:32:19.961 --> 00:32:20.650
<v Speaker 1>So if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

668
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:24.880
<v Speaker 1>if the idea here is that in colleges </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to have these battles.</v>

669
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.170
<v Speaker 1>I know you beat it with better ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how,</v>

670
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.860
<v Speaker 1>how would that have actually happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

671
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I think what probably ended up </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

672
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

673
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm surmising here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how it happened,</v>

674
00:32:36.551 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 1>but I'm guessing that most people are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their daily lives,</v>

675
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:41.264
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That for the same reasons why most </v>

676
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:44.140
<v Speaker 1>people don't speak out against Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

677
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.550
<v Speaker 1>let Dave Rubin worry about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that let someone else were thrilled.</v>

678
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.253
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm busy preparing for my daughter's </v>

679
00:32:51.231 --> 00:32:52.064
<v Speaker 1>graduation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to pick up the tomatoes for my </v>

680
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:54.590
<v Speaker 1>groceries today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

681
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 1>And so people diffused responsibility to</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

682
00:32:57.291 --> 00:32:58.124
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a split within academia from </v>

683
00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:03.410
<v Speaker 1>the sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural and social sciences.</v>

684
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:04.244
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is wrong to presume that the social </v>

685
00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:06.884
<v Speaker 1>sciences are any less committed to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific method in the natural </v>

686
00:33:09.411 --> 00:33:10.340
<v Speaker 1>sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is up to that.</v>

687
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.690
<v Speaker 1>We could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to get to that.</v>

688
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:13.730
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are busy,</v>

689
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.623
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the chemists sits in his lab and he </v>

690
00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:19.320
<v Speaker 1>sees that there's a bunch of humanities </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys authoring utter,</v>

691
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jibberish,</v>

692
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's.</v>

693
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:23.763
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't necessarily have the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and proclivity to weigh in on it </v>

694
00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.453
<v Speaker 1>and so somehow these guys found a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>niche within the ecosystem called </v>

695
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:32.774
<v Speaker 1>academia and they flourished and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplied and the cancer spread and </v>

696
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.630
<v Speaker 1>metastasize and now 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years later,</v>

697
00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.613
<v Speaker 1>you have generations of students who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have spent hundreds of thousands of </v>

698
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:45.590
<v Speaker 1>dollars being trained to be naturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobotomized morons.</v>

699
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the metaphor is perfect of this </v>

700
00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:50.840
<v Speaker 1>parasite that gets in there and keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplying.</v>

701
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:54.680
<v Speaker 1>And I can picture now the biology </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor going,</v>

702
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.820
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of see that,</v>

703
00:33:55.821 --> 00:33:56.654
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to affect me here </v>
<v Speaker 1>except now what we're seeing is it's </v>

704
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:01.010
<v Speaker 1>starting to even creep into that.</v>

705
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The business,</v>

706
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.850
<v Speaker 1>great picture online of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

707
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 1>somebody selling the shirt and it says </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no genders or you can only buy</v>

708
00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:11.220
<v Speaker 1>it in male or female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

709
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.320
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

710
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.850
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about the natural sciences</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus the social sciences first for the</v>

711
00:34:16.851 --> 00:34:18.410
<v Speaker 1>layman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the difference?</v>

712
00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 1>They both have science in the Gad come </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

713
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:23.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the lay,</v>

714
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.133
<v Speaker 1>the lay person will often use these sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of simplifying your risks sticks to </v>

715
00:34:27.621 --> 00:34:31.610
<v Speaker 1>determine what is science versus not if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wearing a lab coat,</v>

716
00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:32.683
<v Speaker 1>if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a couple of chemical </v>

717
00:34:35.241 --> 00:34:39.860
<v Speaker 1>formulas that science because to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>average lay person that's impenetrable.</v>

718
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

719
00:34:41.571 --> 00:34:42.670
<v Speaker 1>most people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

720
00:34:42.671 --> 00:34:43.504
<v Speaker 1>of folk psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have an innate sense of what </v>

721
00:34:44.931 --> 00:34:45.764
<v Speaker 1>psychology is and therefore to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent that they feel that they can </v>

722
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.420
<v Speaker 1>contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they might be laypeople,</v>

723
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.580
<v Speaker 1>somehow that's less impenetrable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

724
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:57.470
<v Speaker 1>So they then will create this false </v>
<v Speaker 1>dichotomy where chemistry and physics,</v>

725
00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.080
<v Speaker 1>that's real science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sociology,</v>

726
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for people who couldn't hack it in,</v>

727
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.170
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in physics.</v>

728
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.273
<v Speaker 1>The reality is that the only difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>is what are the phenomena that you're </v>

729
00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:08.684
<v Speaker 1>studying across these two general </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubrics of science and the social </v>

730
00:35:12.831 --> 00:35:14.780
<v Speaker 1>sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're studying psychology,</v>

731
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:16.910
<v Speaker 1>anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>

732
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:17.803
<v Speaker 1>sociology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be as rigorous as the natural </v>

733
00:35:21.171 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 1>sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example.</v>

734
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:24.710
<v Speaker 1>If you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a sociologist,</v>

735
00:35:24.711 --> 00:35:27.400
<v Speaker 1>you could study sociometric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you know,</v>

736
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.740
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how this power diffused within a network</v>

737
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.820
<v Speaker 1>and you could use very fancy mathematics</v>
<v Speaker 1>graph theory to try to understand this.</v>

738
00:35:34.821 --> 00:35:35.654
<v Speaker 1>So the type of mathematical modeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would use to study how power </v>

739
00:35:38.431 --> 00:35:43.431
<v Speaker 1>diffusers with a network is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very fancy mathematical approach,</v>

740
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:48.450
<v Speaker 1>but sociology has somehow been co opted </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the activists,</v>

741
00:35:48.451 --> 00:35:48.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

742
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.630
<v Speaker 1>So we then view it as being less </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific,</v>

743
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.900
<v Speaker 1>but science is simply means adhering </v>
<v Speaker 1>truthfully to the scientific method.</v>

744
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I posit a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about the data that I would need</v>

745
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:04.950
<v Speaker 1>to collect that would either falsify or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the hypothesis.</v>

746
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:05.903
<v Speaker 1>I collect that data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apply some sort of statistical </v>

747
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:09.594
<v Speaker 1>analysis and mathematical analysis to </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze the data and then I go one way </v>

748
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 1>or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be just as applied.</v>

749
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.000
<v Speaker 1>If it's an economics or if it is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>

750
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.043
<v Speaker 1>so it is wrong because I often get </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters and emails from people asking </v>

751
00:36:22.081 --> 00:36:24.340
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as psychology really escience,</v>

752
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.463
<v Speaker 1>and then of course it's the science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately what is more laudable than </v>

753
00:36:28.711 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 1>studying the most important organism </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we know called humans.</v>

754
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

755
00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:38.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's not as though by the sheer </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of what physicists study,</v>

756
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.340
<v Speaker 1>they are real scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the sociologist is not.</v>

757
00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.183
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to defend sociologist </v>

758
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:45.630
<v Speaker 1>here because I often am the one who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing.</v>

759
00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Usually I'm criticizing them for </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviating from the scientific method.</v>

760
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:52.043
<v Speaker 1>What makes them less scientists is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they become activists and not </v>

761
00:36:55.231 --> 00:36:56.064
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could be just as much as a </v>

762
00:36:57.691 --> 00:36:58.524
<v Speaker 1>scientist if you study something in </v>
<v Speaker 1>business or if you study something in </v>

763
00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:02.070
<v Speaker 1>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

764
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.970
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that you say talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>activists,</v>

765
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.873
<v Speaker 1>not scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what I've been saying </v>

766
00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:07.734
<v Speaker 1>about journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are not doing true </v>

767
00:37:10.381 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 1>journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

768
00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:14.940
<v Speaker 1>finding anymore and reporting nice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on evidence.</v>

769
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:15.774
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is letting their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>biases slam right into the middle of </v>

770
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.150
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for,</v>

771
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.390
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

772
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.673
<v Speaker 1>I will say differentiates the science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural sciences from the social </v>

773
00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:30.420
<v Speaker 1>sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's very much at the heart of the</v>

774
00:37:30.421 --> 00:37:31.254
<v Speaker 1>work that I do.</v>

775
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:35.280
<v Speaker 1>The natural sciences have organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>trees of knowledge.</v>

776
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.353
<v Speaker 1>So in physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people agree on a set of core knowledge </v>

777
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.870
<v Speaker 1>that at this point has become </v>
<v Speaker 1>unassailable,</v>

778
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:44.003
<v Speaker 1>not withstanding the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>still have the epistemic humility to </v>

779
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:46.831
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

780
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:48.630
<v Speaker 1>if new provision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only provisional,</v>

781
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:51.180
<v Speaker 1>if something now falsifies it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to revise it,</v>

782
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.270
<v Speaker 1>but the bedrock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bedrock is there.</v>

783
00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:57.360
<v Speaker 1>There's core knowledge that is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>unassailable.</v>

784
00:37:57.361 --> 00:37:58.194
<v Speaker 1>And physics and chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There aren't chemists who are for the </v>

785
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:04.320
<v Speaker 1>periodic table against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

786
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:05.693
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could build coherent trees of </v>

787
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:09.900
<v Speaker 1>knowledge or the term that I love to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

788
00:38:09.901 --> 00:38:13.500
<v Speaker 1>which was reintroduced into the common </v>
<v Speaker 1>lexicon by Eo Wilson,</v>

789
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.850
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary biologist at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's consilience unity of knowledge.</v>

790
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.833
<v Speaker 1>So the natural sciences by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the nature of how they test theories </v>

791
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.083
<v Speaker 1>have these organized trees of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's lacking in the social </v>

792
00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:29.040
<v Speaker 1>sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's lacking,</v>

793
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not because of the social sciences </v>
<v Speaker 1>are any less scientific,</v>

794
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:36.890
<v Speaker 1>it's because it is easier for ideologies</v>
<v Speaker 1>to creep into the social sciences.</v>

795
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm a libertarian or a Marxist,</v>

796
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
<v Speaker 1>I might study economics in a way that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very polluted by my personal ideology.</v>

797
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:51.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that the social sciences are</v>
<v Speaker 1>epistemologically and he inherently less</v>

798
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:56.371
<v Speaker 1>scientific than chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that biases are easier to creep in.</v>

799
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because I'll hear and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to.</v>

800
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes someone's a leftist economist </v>
<v Speaker 1>or libertarian economists or whatever it</v>

801
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:03.910
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd always think it's kind of funny,</v>

802
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:06.430
<v Speaker 1>like we all have our own beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically.</v>

803
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little more libertarian these </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

804
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but if you're studying something within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the window of the way you want it to be,</v>

805
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:15.580
<v Speaker 1>it's by default is going to be a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>screwy.</v>

806
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>

807
00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:22.850
<v Speaker 1>it is naturally more difficult for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal ideological biases to come into</v>

808
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:26.320
<v Speaker 1>a something that you're studying in </v>
<v Speaker 1>organic chemistry.</v>

809
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:27.303
<v Speaker 1>Although I should mention that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been famous cases where even hard </v>

810
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:34.120
<v Speaker 1>sciences have been deeply polluted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>

811
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:39.120
<v Speaker 1>So Lysenko Ism Lysenko was a Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union,</v>

812
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:40.743
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>geneticists who proposed a theory of </v>

813
00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:49.021
<v Speaker 1>genetics that he thought was more inline</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Marxist philosophy that was a wrong</v>

814
00:39:51.161 --> 00:39:51.994
<v Speaker 1>theory of genetics that led to a massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>famine and to the death of millions of </v>

815
00:39:56.981 --> 00:39:57.814
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even it's not as though hard </v>

816
00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:04.831
<v Speaker 1>scientists are a inoculated from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of being progressive advised</v>

817
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:05.843
<v Speaker 1>by some of these ideological biases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's too late for the hard </v>

818
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:09.034
<v Speaker 1>sciences to be protected?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is it too late for them to turn </v>

819
00:40:11.651 --> 00:40:12.484
<v Speaker 1>their forcefield on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we do see this creeping now in </v>

820
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:14.854
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Bret Weinstein's been talking </v>

821
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:16.594
<v Speaker 1>about this now that now it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaching its hand into that which could </v>

822
00:40:19.961 --> 00:40:22.140
<v Speaker 1>have horrific repercussions for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>

823
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:22.930
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a,</v>

824
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:26.260
<v Speaker 1>when a scientist and the 21st century </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking of myself right now,</v>

825
00:40:26.261 --> 00:40:27.094
<v Speaker 1>it has to appear in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian Senate to argue that there is </v>

826
00:40:29.141 --> 00:40:30.670
<v Speaker 1>such a thing as male and female.</v>

827
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:31.783
<v Speaker 1>That evolutionary biology is based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the recognition that there is sexual </v>

828
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:35.764
<v Speaker 1>dimorphism in human sexual dimorphism is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fancy term for saying basically that </v>

829
00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:42.220
<v Speaker 1>they are evolved sex differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans,</v>

830
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.310
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bales are bigger than females,</v>

831
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a sexual dimorphism.</v>

832
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.980
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that I have to appear in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of the Canadian Senate to actually</v>

833
00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:55.981
<v Speaker 1>argue these things demonstrates how far </v>
<v Speaker 1>the snake has gone into the den.</v>

834
00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a weird way,</v>

835
00:40:57.161 --> 00:41:01.720
<v Speaker 1>your position as a evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologist is a,</v>

836
00:41:01.721 --> 00:41:02.554
<v Speaker 1>is sort of right at the front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of person that this ideology would </v>

837
00:41:05.651 --> 00:41:06.280
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

838
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Just to grab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an evolutionary psychologists.</v>

839
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists are not biologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologists,</v>

840
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I apply evolutionary biological</v>

841
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:14.430
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

842
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:15.131
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

843
00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:15.441
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

844
00:41:15.441 --> 00:41:16.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's craziness,</v>

845
00:41:16.391 --> 00:41:16.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

846
00:41:16.711 --> 00:41:19.650
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason why I'm so if you like,</v>

847
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:20.523
<v Speaker 1>aware of the epistemological dichotomy </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the natural and social sciences </v>

848
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.023
<v Speaker 1>is because my scientific career of 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus years has really been straddling </v>

849
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:29.800
<v Speaker 1>both these fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

850
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 1>I apply evolutionary biology to study </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer behavior.</v>

851
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Consumer behavior would be construed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something within the social sciences.</v>

852
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Evolutionary biology is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is within the natural sciences,</v>

853
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.713
<v Speaker 1>so I really am very much steeped in both</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures and I see the extent to which </v>

854
00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:48.734
<v Speaker 1>it is easier for people to succumb to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their personal biases and the social </v>

855
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:53.480
<v Speaker 1>sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just give you one example.</v>

856
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:59.270
<v Speaker 1>If you start off with the premise that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't agree on whether there is such</v>

857
00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 1>a thing as an eight sex differences or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

858
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:02.683
<v Speaker 1>how could you from that starting point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever build a tree of knowledge that's </v>

859
00:42:06.081 --> 00:42:08.630
<v Speaker 1>organized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If at this most fundamental level,</v>

860
00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:11.120
<v Speaker 1>we can agree that there is such a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>as male or female,</v>

861
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.500
<v Speaker 1>then we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're cooked.</v>

862
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:13.643
<v Speaker 1>A physicists don't suffer from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and that's why they make much </v>

863
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:19.010
<v Speaker 1>better progress than than social </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists do.</v>

864
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.640
<v Speaker 1>So as someone that studies marketing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we behave,</v>

865
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.730
<v Speaker 1>how we do what turns us on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what turns us off,</v>

866
00:42:25.731 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a weird way,</v>

867
00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:28.154
<v Speaker 1>you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were prepared for everything that </v>

868
00:42:29.331 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 1>was going to happen politically right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and what's happening on the academic</v>

869
00:42:33.411 --> 00:42:36.740
<v Speaker 1>front because all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all marketing in a way.</v>

870
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's marketing.</v>

871
00:42:38.001 --> 00:42:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Market yourself in a,</v>

872
00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:40.803
<v Speaker 1>in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the trends were all their life that </v>

873
00:42:43.531 --> 00:42:44.560
<v Speaker 1>has marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

874
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.270
<v Speaker 1>So when people asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

875
00:42:46.271 --> 00:42:48.650
<v Speaker 1>what do you study as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a professor of marketing,</v>

876
00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:52.070
<v Speaker 1>and I always answered them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything you do in life is marketing.</v>

877
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.800
<v Speaker 1>You market yourself on the mating </v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

878
00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:57.420
<v Speaker 1>We even use the euphemisms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace,</v>

879
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

880
00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.440
<v Speaker 1>you position yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace,</v>

881
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.780
<v Speaker 1>you market yourself and the labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

882
00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:03.853
<v Speaker 1>You market yourself to friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you position yourself depending on </v>

883
00:43:07.161 --> 00:43:09.230
<v Speaker 1>whether you wish to belong to a group or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

884
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Animals communicate with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

885
00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:13.610
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when animals advertise,</v>

886
00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:14.630
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the peacock,</v>

887
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:18.860
<v Speaker 1>the peacock is literally engaging and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspicuous advertising.</v>

888
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:19.963
<v Speaker 1>So everything in life as marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the reasons why I was very </v>

889
00:43:23.391 --> 00:43:24.224
<v Speaker 1>much interested in applying all of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>training in marketing is because that's </v>

890
00:43:28.341 --> 00:43:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I think where all the sexy stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

891
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.540
<v Speaker 1>We take all of these principles from </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

892
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:34.130
<v Speaker 1>from economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from biology,</v>

893
00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:35.183
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I apply them in areas that are </v>

894
00:43:37.161 --> 00:43:37.994
<v Speaker 1>of greatest import to most people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there something kind of scary about </v>

895
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:41.324
<v Speaker 1>that though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's not that the best ideas will </v>

896
00:43:43.401 --> 00:43:44.234
<v Speaker 1>necessarily when it's that the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketed ideas or win and those often </v>

897
00:43:47.241 --> 00:43:50.030
<v Speaker 1>are not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good point.</v>

898
00:43:50.031 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

899
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm right now working on my next book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just connected with a,</v>

900
00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:55.293
<v Speaker 1>a what appears to be a wonderful that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very agent and he actually made this </v>

901
00:43:58.611 --> 00:43:59.180
<v Speaker 1>exact point.</v>

902
00:43:59.180 --> 00:43:59.750
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

903
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.583
<v Speaker 1>what's really important as we move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward with your book is how to market </v>

904
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:04.184
<v Speaker 1>it because there'll be people who will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be very resistant to the ideas that you </v>

905
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:09.980
<v Speaker 1>propose in that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

906
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.870
<v Speaker 1>everything is marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically if you want to.</v>

907
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.113
<v Speaker 1>So did trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think have not to bring </v>

908
00:44:15.021 --> 00:44:16.730
<v Speaker 1>everything back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he must've had,</v>

909
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.593
<v Speaker 1>I guess as a businessman and putting his</v>
<v Speaker 1>name all over these things for the last </v>

910
00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:21.554
<v Speaker 1>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had an innate understanding of </v>

911
00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:25.760
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you're talking about and </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

912
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:26.653
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could speak to one thing that he knew </v>

913
00:44:28.521 --> 00:44:29.354
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could completely read that many </v>

914
00:44:31.801 --> 00:44:32.634
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the silent majority or certainly a </v>

915
00:44:34.381 --> 00:44:35.214
<v Speaker 1>sizable minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're going to use the popular vote </v>

916
00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:41.430
<v Speaker 1>that we're fed up with political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness and said,</v>

917
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:42.443
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be the anti pc guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he bet pretty much everything on </v>

918
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:49.470
<v Speaker 1>that and it turns out that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>responded to it,</v>

919
00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:49.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

920
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:52.560
<v Speaker 1>He could have equivocated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could have been more careful with his</v>

921
00:44:52.561 --> 00:44:54.060
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he sort of,</v>

922
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:58.890
<v Speaker 1>he flies off the handle because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that the general atmosphere was</v>

923
00:44:58.891 --> 00:45:01.950
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're having chats on facebook</v>

924
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:06.000
<v Speaker 1>or at their workplace by the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooler at the university,</v>

925
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:06.893
<v Speaker 1>are tired of feeling stifled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are tired of feeling scared of the next </v>

926
00:45:10.531 --> 00:45:14.160
<v Speaker 1>syllable that they might miss other that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might ruin their careers.</v>

927
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the anti pc warrior,</v>

928
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.370
<v Speaker 1>and people responded to that marketing </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

929
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.350
<v Speaker 1>So as someone that studies all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

930
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.250
<v Speaker 1>what do you think people really drives </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at the end of the day?</v>

931
00:45:26.251 --> 00:45:27.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned before,</v>

932
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often I think it's just a couple things.</v>

933
00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 1>You want to have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have some money,</v>

934
00:45:30.601 --> 00:45:32.640
<v Speaker 1>hopefully a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a family,</v>

935
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:34.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe some sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

936
00:45:34.051 --> 00:45:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Just the basic stuff that we all do.</v>

937
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.370
<v Speaker 1>You think those are really just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>undesired?</v>

938
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:40.440
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in several of my books,</v>

939
00:45:40.441 --> 00:45:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I actually answered that question in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>following way.</v>

940
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I map consumption acts onto four key </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian modules.</v>

941
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.550
<v Speaker 1>So think about how maslow's hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

942
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.130
<v Speaker 1>so at the basic level there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological needs and then belonging,</v>

943
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.233
<v Speaker 1>safety needs belonging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This needs all the way up to self </v>

944
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:00.300
<v Speaker 1>actualization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

945
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 1>his theory was really based on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanistic philosophy.</v>

946
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.780
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this bias,</v>

947
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:07.614
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ideological bias of how humans </v>

948
00:46:09.211 --> 00:46:10.044
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't necessarily grounded in an </v>

949
00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:15.810
<v Speaker 1>understanding of biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took this principal and I said,</v>

950
00:46:15.811 --> 00:46:16.644
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see what actually drives people </v>

951
00:46:19.411 --> 00:46:23.460
<v Speaker 1>based on biological principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my four Darwinian modules are the</v>

952
00:46:23.461 --> 00:46:24.294
<v Speaker 1>survival module.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the things that we do are </v>

953
00:46:26.461 --> 00:46:31.440
<v Speaker 1>related to our survival instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our preference for fatty foods,</v>

954
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.573
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that it's easy for us to </v>

955
00:46:33.631 --> 00:46:34.464
<v Speaker 1>succumb to the desert effect having an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra piece of dessert when we've </v>

956
00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:39.600
<v Speaker 1>already had more calories and we need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

957
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:40.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes from the fact that our </v>

958
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:41.964
<v Speaker 1>gustatory preferences have evolved in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment of caloric scarcity and </v>

959
00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:48.840
<v Speaker 1>caloric uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your taste buds and mine are vestiges</v>

960
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.990
<v Speaker 1>of an environment long gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that we've evolved to have.</v>

961
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.300
<v Speaker 1>But can your brain evolved to override </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

962
00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.260
<v Speaker 1>That's actually called the mismatch </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>

963
00:46:58.261 --> 00:46:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll come to it and sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

964
00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.510
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first we've got survival,</v>

965
00:47:00.511 --> 00:47:03.570
<v Speaker 1>then we've got a reproduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything related to sex.</v>

966
00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:04.643
<v Speaker 1>Why do men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are 99 percent of Ferrari owners </v>

967
00:47:07.231 --> 00:47:09.390
<v Speaker 1>mail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the form of peacocking.</v>

968
00:47:09.391 --> 00:47:12.780
<v Speaker 1>So the peacock stale is literally the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aston Martin that men drive,</v>

969
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:13.614
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course both men and women engage </v>

970
00:47:15.511 --> 00:47:18.090
<v Speaker 1>in sexual signaling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first we've got survival instincts.</v>

971
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:21.030
<v Speaker 1>We've got a reproduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we've got kin selection.</v>

972
00:47:21.031 --> 00:47:21.864
<v Speaker 1>Kin Selection is the mechanism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>explains why is it that I would jump </v>

973
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:26.400
<v Speaker 1>into the river to save three of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers.</v>

974
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 1>If all I care about is my survivability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would I ever take the risk on them?</v>

975
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you realize that a natural </v>

976
00:47:33.071 --> 00:47:35.500
<v Speaker 1>selection operates at the level of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene,</v>

977
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:36.603
<v Speaker 1>then saving three brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of whom share half the genes with </v>

978
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 1>me makes sense.</v>

979
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:40.901
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

980
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:44.110
<v Speaker 1>how do you apply that in consumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior while gift giving practices?</v>

981
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.153
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how I modulate the size of the gift </v>

982
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:48.424
<v Speaker 1>that I give to different people turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to be perfectly correlated to the </v>

983
00:47:51.641 --> 00:47:54.010
<v Speaker 1>genetic relatedness with each of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

984
00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I give larger gifts to my brother than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do to my second cousin.</v>

985
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:58.503
<v Speaker 1>I may not do this consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may not know all these fancy theories </v>

986
00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:04.330
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our brains have evolved to recognize</v>

987
00:48:04.331 --> 00:48:06.910
<v Speaker 1>that people are not of equal genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatedness.</v>

988
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.580
<v Speaker 1>And the fourth module is reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>altruism.</v>

989
00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:11.163
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I jumped into the river to save three </v>

990
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:13.294
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why would I jump in to save Dave </v>

991
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Ruben?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not my brother.</v>

992
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes from this evolved idea of tit</v>

993
00:48:19.061 --> 00:48:20.830
<v Speaker 1>for tat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I scratch your back.</v>

994
00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:21.970
<v Speaker 1>You scratch mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

995
00:48:21.971 --> 00:48:22.804
<v Speaker 1>today I might jump to save you with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation that tomorrow when I'm </v>

996
00:48:25.421 --> 00:48:27.370
<v Speaker 1>drowning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you'll come and save me.</v>

997
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.490
<v Speaker 1>So this idea of reciprocity has evolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>for social species,</v>

998
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.473
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it explains why I will invite you out </v>

999
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:37.480
<v Speaker 1>for dinner when it's your birthday and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you will hopefully reciprocate when it's</v>

1000
00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a strict economic perspective,</v>

1001
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:40.660
<v Speaker 1>there's no point to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1002
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's not invite each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll be at the same final position.</v>

1003
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.280
<v Speaker 1>The reason why we do this exchange is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil our friendship and our bond.</v>

1004
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 1>So I argue that much of consumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior could be mapped onto these four</v>

1005
00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:53.880
<v Speaker 1>modules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now to your other question,</v>

1006
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.553
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very difficult for our brain to </v>

1007
00:48:57.131 --> 00:48:59.890
<v Speaker 1>catch up to a current reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1008
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 1>men have evolved sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual territoriality as a,</v>

1009
00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.700
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a strong element of their psychology,</v>

1010
00:49:06.701 --> 00:49:07.534
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like women to be promiscuous </v>

1011
00:49:09.821 --> 00:49:14.200
<v Speaker 1>if there with them they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get sexually jealous.</v>

1012
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.390
<v Speaker 1>If another man touches a woman and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1013
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Well why would that have evolved?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That goes both ways,</v>

1014
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men and women,</v>

1015
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:20.980
<v Speaker 1>interestingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1016
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:24.850
<v Speaker 1>so that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not my voice.</v>

1017
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.430
<v Speaker 1>This is David buses work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a colleague,</v>

1018
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.290
<v Speaker 1>evolution psychologist at the University</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Texas,</v>

1019
00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked at what some of his colleagues</v>

1020
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:36.370
<v Speaker 1>at romantic infidelity versus sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>infidelity.</v>

1021
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:38.470
<v Speaker 1>So he brought in people to the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1022
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:39.483
<v Speaker 1>he set him up with all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological measures to measure their </v>

1023
00:49:42.191 --> 00:49:45.130
<v Speaker 1>stress and had them read one of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>vignettes.</v>

1024
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:46.583
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1025
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.220
<v Speaker 1>your husband right now is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1026
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.530
<v Speaker 1>having sex with the gorgeous secretary </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus a,</v>

1027
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.020
<v Speaker 1>your husband is developing an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>bond with his coworker.</v>

1028
00:49:56.021 --> 00:49:57.510
<v Speaker 1>She laughs at his jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1029
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.353
<v Speaker 1>they get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in one case you trigger sexual </v>

1030
00:50:00.461 --> 00:50:03.010
<v Speaker 1>fidelity and the other one romantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>infidelity.</v>

1031
00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:03.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that women respond much </v>

1032
00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:06.650
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1033
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:10.930
<v Speaker 1>adversely to romantic infidelity than to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual infidelity.</v>

1034
00:50:10.931 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And that effect is reversed for men.</v>

1035
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:13.953
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean that women </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate sexual infidelity or are </v>

1036
00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:18.520
<v Speaker 1>tolerant of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's less.</v>

1037
00:50:18.521 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the reasons for it?</v>

1038
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that sexual infidelity is a</v>

1039
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:27.470
<v Speaker 1>profoundly important evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem for men because we're a parental</v>

1040
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:30.530
<v Speaker 1>species where males invest a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their children.</v>

1041
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.260
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make a lot of sense for me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>invest for many,</v>

1042
00:50:33.261 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 1>many years until little johnny grows up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be sexually mature.</v>

1043
00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:37.813
<v Speaker 1>So then find out that it was the sexy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek or Roman gardener who sired that </v>

1044
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:41.990
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1045
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I evolve this,</v>

1046
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.930
<v Speaker 1>the psychological apparatus to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect against this possibility.</v>

1047
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.470
<v Speaker 1>So I am very intolerant of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>infidelity.</v>

1048
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:52.543
<v Speaker 1>If a woman cheats on a man that almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantees the end of the solution the </v>

1049
00:50:54.771 --> 00:50:55.940
<v Speaker 1>other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

1050
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:57.343
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the greatest threat to a woman's </v>

1051
00:50:59.031 --> 00:50:59.864
<v Speaker 1>interest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that he has a sexual dalliance </v>

1052
00:51:02.991 --> 00:51:03.650
<v Speaker 1>one time.</v>

1053
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.410
<v Speaker 1>This is why men very naively often will </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1054
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I just had sex with her once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She meant nothing to me.</v>

1055
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:10.603
<v Speaker 1>They actually think that this is helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is no emotional bond </v>

1056
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:15.380
<v Speaker 1>between us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a one time thing,</v>

1057
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:16.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

1058
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:21.140
<v Speaker 1>if a man develops a emotional tie with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

1059
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:22.183
<v Speaker 1>that's a much greater predictor of him </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving the relationship and that's why </v>

1060
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:28.370
<v Speaker 1>women respond so adversity to emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>infidelity.</v>

1061
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.440
<v Speaker 1>But if a man says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1062
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:32.090
<v Speaker 1>it was just a one time thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't he?</v>

1063
00:51:32.091 --> 00:51:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Then let's assume it's the truth for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second guy who does it one time.</v>

1064
00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:37.820
<v Speaker 1>He's telling the woman what she wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear right?</v>

1065
00:51:37.821 --> 00:51:38.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1066
00:51:38.201 --> 00:51:39.034
<v Speaker 1>what if it's true for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also what she does want to hear it </v>

1067
00:51:41.111 --> 00:51:42.140
<v Speaker 1>because she doesn't want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1068
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:47.141
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly a much better for him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say it was a onetime thing rather than I</v>

1069
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:48.044
<v Speaker 1>think I'm falling for her and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>planning on having sex and another 37 </v>

1070
00:51:50.541 --> 00:51:51.374
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he genuinely honestly is trying to </v>

1071
00:51:53.841 --> 00:51:57.350
<v Speaker 1>convey to her that she literally meant </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to him.</v>

1072
00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:58.183
<v Speaker 1>He's perfectly able to decouple the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual act from any emotional </v>

1073
00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:03.404
<v Speaker 1>investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1074
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:06.590
<v Speaker 1>When you think about when John's we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>go see prostitutes,</v>

1075
00:52:06.591 --> 00:52:07.424
<v Speaker 1>what do they typically tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's perfectly unencumbered sex and I'm </v>

1076
00:52:10.641 --> 00:52:15.641
<v Speaker 1>able to have sex with her and walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pay for that walking away.</v>

1077
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

1078
00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.434
<v Speaker 1>that speaks to evolved sex differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole conversation that we've had </v>

1079
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:25.670
<v Speaker 1>might be trans phobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>systemic violence on their bill.</v>

1080
00:52:25.671 --> 00:52:26.504
<v Speaker 1>C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>

1081
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.190
<v Speaker 1>because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't talk about the non or nonbinary</v>

1082
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:30.083
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must be a genocide supporter </v>

1083
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.133
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm glad you just mentioned that </v>

1084
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:35.623
<v Speaker 1>because as you're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even exactly sure what my </v>

1085
00:52:37.491 --> 00:52:40.370
<v Speaker 1>question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is there an element a,</v>

1086
00:52:40.371 --> 00:52:41.204
<v Speaker 1>as you're sitting across from a gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that enters some of the </v>

1087
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:44.680
<v Speaker 1>questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1088
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we finished the mismatch </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1089
00:52:47.031 --> 00:52:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1090
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get to that.</v>

1091
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Let me finish that then we'll talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality given me a lot here.</v>

1092
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I want it to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

1093
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1094
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.333
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1095
00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:57.253
<v Speaker 1>So it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our brains don't catch up as quickly as </v>

1096
00:53:02.091 --> 00:53:04.220
<v Speaker 1>we otherwise would want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1097
00:53:04.221 --> 00:53:06.800
<v Speaker 1>the fact that look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top killers,</v>

1098
00:53:06.801 --> 00:53:09.260
<v Speaker 1>the top medical killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colon cancer,</v>

1099
00:53:09.261 --> 00:53:10.520
<v Speaker 1>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes,</v>

1100
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 1>from an evolutionary medicine </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1101
00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:13.484
<v Speaker 1>the argument is that it stems from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that today we live in an </v>

1102
00:53:17.091 --> 00:53:17.924
<v Speaker 1>environment of plenty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our gustatory preferences have </v>

1103
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:25.220
<v Speaker 1>evolved in an environment of caloric </v>
<v Speaker 1>scar city and uncertainty.</v>

1104
00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:26.213
<v Speaker 1>That mismatch between our current </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment of plenty and the </v>

1105
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:33.480
<v Speaker 1>environment in which we evolved causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these top killers.</v>

1106
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.790
<v Speaker 1>So to answer your question in a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>winded way,</v>

1107
00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:36.923
<v Speaker 1>know our brains don't catch up if there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were selection pressures for the next x </v>

1108
00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:42.714
<v Speaker 1>number of years to cause an evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory to change that it would </v>

1109
00:53:46.831 --> 00:53:47.664
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but typically for even the most basic </v>

1110
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:53.580
<v Speaker 1>genetic selection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might take say 5,000</v>

1111
00:53:53.581 --> 00:53:53.940
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1112
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:54.773
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess what I'm talking about then </v>

1113
00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:56.843
<v Speaker 1>is for the person that never goes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the desert or never engines on this or </v>

1114
00:54:00.631 --> 00:54:02.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not an evolutionary thing.</v>

1115
00:54:02.311 --> 00:54:03.144
<v Speaker 1>As much as it's someone that's aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that's educated and aware of </v>

1116
00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.980
<v Speaker 1>that these things can cause health </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and you might be like,</v>

1117
00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I live here in la where everyone doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat this or that or doesn't want gluten.</v>

1118
00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has celiac disease,</v>

1119
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:20.400
<v Speaker 1>which no one had celiac disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not evolution.</v>

1120
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:23.970
<v Speaker 1>That's just sort of doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different with the information you have.</v>

1121
00:54:23.971 --> 00:54:24.804
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not on the macro level and </v>

1122
00:54:25.951 --> 00:54:26.784
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary thing and sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have multiple Darwinian pools pulling </v>

1123
00:54:31.021 --> 00:54:34.770
<v Speaker 1>you in different directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the net effect is zero.</v>

1124
00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:35.604
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I explained why they are </v>

1125
00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:38.574
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary pressures for both men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women to cheat on their longterm </v>

1126
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:44.190
<v Speaker 1>partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that it's a fatalistic</v>

1127
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:46.050
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not biological determinism,</v>

1128
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:51.051
<v Speaker 1>we're doomed to cheat because we also </v>
<v Speaker 1>have evolved the moral calculus,</v>

1129
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:51.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1130
00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.373
<v Speaker 1>Our morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're a religious person that </v>

1131
00:54:54.121 --> 00:54:54.954
<v Speaker 1>thinks that it comes from God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our morality has also evolved through </v>

1132
00:54:57.901 --> 00:55:01.740
<v Speaker 1>the exact same evolutionary forces that </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain why we have opposable thumbs.</v>

1133
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:05.550
<v Speaker 1>And so on the one hand I'd like to very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much cheat on my wife.</v>

1134
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.473
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this moral calculus that stops </v>

1135
00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:11.460
<v Speaker 1>me from doing the net effect is that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>might actually not do it.</v>

1136
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:14.100
<v Speaker 1>So this speaks to a really important </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1137
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:14.934
<v Speaker 1>which is the fact that you explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>something from an evolutionary </v>

1138
00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:20.880
<v Speaker 1>perspective doesn't mean that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically fatalistic.</v>

1139
00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1140
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.090
<v Speaker 1>So homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1141
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Now if we add that into this mix that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about here.</v>

1142
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:28.943
<v Speaker 1>So the top theory that has been proposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has not the data has not </v>

1143
00:55:34.111 --> 00:55:36.990
<v Speaker 1>cooperated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from actually kin selection.</v>

1144
00:55:36.991 --> 00:55:41.340
<v Speaker 1>So let me explain this a bit technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could increase your fitness,</v>

1145
00:55:41.341 --> 00:55:42.150
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

1146
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:45.150
<v Speaker 1>you could extend your genes through </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct reproduction.</v>

1147
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:46.690
<v Speaker 1>That's called direct fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1148
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:48.660
<v Speaker 1>If I have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm extending my genes,</v>

1149
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.000
<v Speaker 1>but I could also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

1150
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:51.893
<v Speaker 1>increase my inclusive fitness by </v>
<v Speaker 1>investing in those who are related to </v>

1151
00:55:55.261 --> 00:55:55.800
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I.</v>

1152
00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:00.800
<v Speaker 1>When I invest in my nephews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am indirectly extending my jeans.</v>

1153
00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:01.824
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the argument then is that a </v>

1154
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:05.483
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality need not be a Darwinian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could the sock meaning a Darwinian dead </v>

1155
00:56:09.421 --> 00:56:10.254
<v Speaker 1>end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even though you may decide to </v>

1156
00:56:13.471 --> 00:56:17.250
<v Speaker 1>not have children by investing in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>kin,</v>

1157
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 1>you could still be extending your genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1158
00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:21.360
<v Speaker 1>how would you test this idea while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would take,</v>

1159
00:56:21.361 --> 00:56:22.194
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexual uncles and heterosexual </v>

1160
00:56:24.821 --> 00:56:29.821
<v Speaker 1>uncles and see if the homosexual uncles </v>
<v Speaker 1>invest more in their nephews and nieces?</v>

1161
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:31.443
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer would be yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that would be one data point that </v>

1162
00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:35.524
<v Speaker 1>supports the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have taught my nephew everything I </v>

1163
00:56:37.451 --> 00:56:42.070
<v Speaker 1>know about star wars and I am very knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year,</v>

1164
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:44.380
<v Speaker 1>but the data has not supported that.</v>

1165
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 1>So the bottom line is the top argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top evolution,</v>

1166
00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:51.040
<v Speaker 1>if the data has not said that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happened exactly,</v>

1167
00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 1>and always the that kin selection based </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument for homosexuality,</v>

1168
00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:58.960
<v Speaker 1>while at the theoretical level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptually speaking,</v>

1169
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:02.740
<v Speaker 1>sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The data has not supported that.</v>

1170
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:03.993
<v Speaker 1>So that's as far as I know about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nexus between homosexuality and </v>

1171
00:57:06.791 --> 00:57:09.640
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I think we might have mentioned</v>

1172
00:57:09.641 --> 00:57:13.190
<v Speaker 1>this when you came on my show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have a current doctoral student who</v>

1173
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:17.050
<v Speaker 1>was actually planning on studying in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctoral dissertation,</v>

1174
00:57:17.051 --> 00:57:20.710
<v Speaker 1>the intersection between now get ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this homosexuality,</v>

1175
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:24.460
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary psychology and consumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and how's that gonna work?</v>

1176
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:29.670
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to look at phenomena that</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically happen between men and women.</v>

1177
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.310
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go out on a first date,</v>

1178
00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to never have a second date</v>

1179
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:39.270
<v Speaker 1>and the heterosexual context is for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man to be cheap on a first date,</v>

1180
00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:39.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1181
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:40.660
<v Speaker 1>That guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end,</v>

1182
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:44.980
<v Speaker 1>even if the woman is a billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he exhibits cues of frugality,</v>

1183
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:46.330
<v Speaker 1>it's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:47.163
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then let's take this idea and see </v>

1185
00:57:48.851 --> 00:57:51.700
<v Speaker 1>whether within the context of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamics of homosexual relationship,</v>

1186
00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:54.700
<v Speaker 1>when two men go out on a date for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>

1187
00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:57.100
<v Speaker 1>could we see a replication of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon?</v>

1188
00:57:57.101 --> 00:58:00.820
<v Speaker 1>But now there isn't male female here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would be the proxy measure?</v>

1189
00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Top bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So could,</v>

1190
00:58:03.131 --> 00:58:03.964
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sex role as either a predominantly </v>

1191
00:58:06.641 --> 00:58:07.474
<v Speaker 1>top or predominantly bottom replicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sex differences that we typically </v>

1192
00:58:12.461 --> 00:58:14.980
<v Speaker 1>see the interactions between men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

1193
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:17.170
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of that by the way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1194
00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting because I don't know</v>

1195
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:24.190
<v Speaker 1>that your sexual position has anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with how you necessarily on a date</v>

1196
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:26.110
<v Speaker 1>would say I'm going to pay or not pay.</v>

1197
00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1198
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get this.</v>

1199
00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 1>You were saying that basically the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that the masculine,</v>

1200
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1201
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's something that's what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would've guessed that,</v>

1202
00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>test something.</v>

1203
00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Let's take another example of exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea.</v>

1204
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when,</v>

1205
00:58:42.971 --> 00:58:43.804
<v Speaker 1>when men and women mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's what's called assortative </v>

1206
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.040
<v Speaker 1>mating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So birds of a feather flock together.</v>

1207
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.113
<v Speaker 1>So typically women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that women want necessarily </v>

1208
00:58:51.551 --> 00:58:53.800
<v Speaker 1>tall guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they want a taller guy,</v>

1209
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:54.723
<v Speaker 1>so it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare for a woman to date </v>

1210
00:58:57.401 --> 00:58:58.234
<v Speaker 1>someone shorter than her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's actually a study that was </v>

1211
00:58:59.951 --> 00:59:02.800
<v Speaker 1>done with 720 naturally occurring </v>
<v Speaker 1>couples,</v>

1212
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:08.070
<v Speaker 1>only one of the seven slash 20 was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman taller than the men really quick.</v>

1213
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.393
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's now let's apply that to almost </v>

1214
00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:14.920
<v Speaker 1>now I haven't done the research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's my hypothesis.</v>

1215
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I bet that the top bottom distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>will determine the height thing.</v>

1216
00:59:22.161 --> 00:59:22.994
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the bottom guy will be in a longterm </v>

1217
00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 1>union and the not a meeting and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gay sauna for quick sex,</v>

1218
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:34.870
<v Speaker 1>but longterm paragon know a marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1219
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:35.773
<v Speaker 1>he'll be the shorter guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the phenomena that we would </v>

1220
00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:38.894
<v Speaker 1>pick up from evolutionary psychology as </v>
<v Speaker 1>applied to heterosexual context will </v>

1221
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:45.920
<v Speaker 1>replicate in the homosexual contexts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm curious with all this being said,</v>

1222
00:59:45.921 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 1>and as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1223
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.820
<v Speaker 1>you're hypothesizing about some of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and obviously your,</v>

1224
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:52.140
<v Speaker 1>your students going to work on some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and other people are going to.</v>

1225
00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Is there a complication that links </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else we've been talking about</v>

1226
00:59:57.101 --> 00:59:57.934
<v Speaker 1>where if you talk about gay anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this could get you in some sort of </v>

1227
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:02.714
<v Speaker 1>trouble?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't since you feel that as you're </v>

1228
01:00:03.651 --> 01:00:04.484
<v Speaker 1>talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there would be some piece of </v>

1229
01:00:05.961 --> 01:00:06.794
<v Speaker 1>this that you might find something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would lead you to somewhere </v>

1230
01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable or something in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of academia.</v>

1231
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean you personally well,</v>

1232
01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.153
<v Speaker 1>but I actually think that if you do any </v>
<v Speaker 1>research right now on any of the Lgbtq </v>

1233
01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:19.334
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a very good thing because </v>

1234
01:00:20.031 --> 01:00:21.800
<v Speaker 1>it would be somehow label as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive.</v>

1235
01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:22.933
<v Speaker 1>So in the context of the els that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to a conclusion that was not </v>

1236
01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:27.770
<v Speaker 1>politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1237
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.753
<v Speaker 1>So that speaks to actually an issue that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've discussed with several folks and I </v>

1238
01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>think perhaps maybe Sam Harris mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when he had me on his show,</v>

1239
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.193
<v Speaker 1>he was asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any research that you were </v>

1240
01:00:37.531 --> 01:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>concerned I wanted to ask you this very </v>
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>

1241
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe we can get into that at and the</v>

1242
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:43.843
<v Speaker 1>term that I had used with him then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which came from a paper that was </v>

1243
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>published in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forbidden Knowledge.</v>

1244
01:00:48.741 --> 01:00:49.574
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a strong non proponent of the idea </v>

1245
01:00:52.161 --> 01:00:53.030
<v Speaker 1>of forbidden knowledge.</v>

1246
01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.193
<v Speaker 1>If research is done honestly said you </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asley with a full adherence to the </v>

1247
01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:00.104
<v Speaker 1>scientific method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there is no question that is taboo </v>

1248
01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:03.893
<v Speaker 1>to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually speaks to something in </v>

1249
01:01:06.471 --> 01:01:07.304
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between deontological </v>

1250
01:01:09.621 --> 01:01:10.454
<v Speaker 1>ethics and consequentialist ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anthological ethics is the </v>

1251
01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:15.860
<v Speaker 1>following.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is never okay to lie.</v>

1252
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:17.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthological statement.</v>

1253
01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>A consequentialist ethics statement </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>

1254
01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>well it might be okay to lie the pending</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the consequences of the lot.</v>

1255
01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1256
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.430
<v Speaker 1>If it's going to cause 20 people to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1257
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>So one is an absolute as perspective one</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1258
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a situation on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on the consequences,</v>

1259
01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.693
<v Speaker 1>so I will use that framework to answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>the forbidden taboo question of what </v>

1260
01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:44.261
<v Speaker 1>kind of research is okay or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are a purist at the ontological,</v>

1261
01:01:44.271 --> 01:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>epistemological person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do research wherever it takes me,</v>

1262
01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:50.390
<v Speaker 1>then you don't care about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

1263
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>If you are a consequentialist bent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you say,</v>

1264
01:01:53.721 --> 01:01:54.554
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we do race differences and the </v>

1265
01:01:57.171 --> 01:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>results come out in a way that it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be used to harm a racial group,</v>

1266
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:02.323
<v Speaker 1>then we should stay away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that that's a </v>

1267
01:02:04.311 --> 01:02:05.144
<v Speaker 1>profoundly dangerous position to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's precisely this type of </v>

1268
01:02:08.631 --> 01:02:13.250
<v Speaker 1>argument that led the social sciences to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reject biology as being important.</v>

1269
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1270
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:18.770
<v Speaker 1>the early anthropologist cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropologist who said biology,</v>

1271
01:02:18.771 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter for humans were coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an honorable place because they saw</v>

1272
01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>how cretins could misuse biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1273
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1274
01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a battle between the races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Darwinian struggle.</v>

1275
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>We're area and we won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

1276
01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Let the Jews die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1277
01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:36.804
<v Speaker 1>the British social class Aletha said </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a battle between the social </v>

1278
01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lower classes last,</v>

1279
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>screw them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Darwinian struggle,</v>

1280
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>of course this has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwin,</v>

1281
01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.760
<v Speaker 1>but because these folks misappropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>misappropriated biological thinking than</v>

1282
01:02:51.451 --> 01:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>the cultural anthropologists came along </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

1283
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.083
<v Speaker 1>let's get rid of biology because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can misuse it and now we're in </v>

1284
01:02:57.451 --> 01:02:58.284
<v Speaker 1>the quagmire where we are today where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to appear in front of the Canadian </v>

1285
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Senate to argue that there is such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as male or female.</v>

1286
01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:05.580
<v Speaker 1>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are a purist,</v>

1287
01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:06.414
<v Speaker 1>you pursue knowledge wherever it takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you unencumbered by the consequences is </v>

1288
01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:12.990
<v Speaker 1>the problem that I suppose a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people,</v>

1289
01:03:12.991 --> 01:03:17.991
<v Speaker 1>scientists included probably think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a purist but actually aren't.</v>

1290
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.250
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1291
01:03:20.251 --> 01:03:23.430
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Mengele probably thought that,</v>

1292
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is doing all sorts of eof all Nazi </v>

1293
01:03:25.581 --> 01:03:26.414
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not.</v>

1294
01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:27.713
<v Speaker 1>In this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that Nazi references out is </v>

1295
01:03:29.821 --> 01:03:30.654
<v Speaker 1>actually sensible as opposed to Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>references that are thrown around all </v>

1296
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:33.840
<v Speaker 1>day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1297
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.673
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Mengele was doing horrific </v>

1298
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:38.663
<v Speaker 1>experiments on twins and just all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that were considered a beyond </v>

1299
01:03:44.251 --> 01:03:45.300
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrible.</v>

1300
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:50.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably believed that he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for the good of truth and the good of</v>

1301
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.080
<v Speaker 1>science and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1302
01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:52.933
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he may have been a horrific </v>

1303
01:03:54.271 --> 01:03:54.540
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1304
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.373
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he in his heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably thought he was doing good </v>

1305
01:03:57.001 --> 01:03:58.110
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so.</v>

1306
01:03:58.111 --> 01:03:58.944
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that I would say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would stop that from happening now is </v>

1307
01:04:01.411 --> 01:04:02.244
<v Speaker 1>that we do have institutional review </v>
<v Speaker 1>boards or ethics boards now that ensure </v>

1308
01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:07.884
<v Speaker 1>that there is a boundary on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific pursuits that you could </v>

1309
01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.910
<v Speaker 1>pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is,</v>

1310
01:04:14.911 --> 01:04:17.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't frivolously harm animals.</v>

1311
01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:19.830
<v Speaker 1>The way you treat them in the lab is </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1312
01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.813
<v Speaker 1>You can't frivolously harm both </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically and slash or psychologically </v>

1313
01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:27.090
<v Speaker 1>human subjects right by incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly though,</v>

1314
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.620
<v Speaker 1>now they've gone overboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

1315
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:31.483
<v Speaker 1>the institutional review boards now have</v>
<v Speaker 1>become so aware to want to be the </v>

1316
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.653
<v Speaker 1>emphasis of Mandalay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that now if I asked you what is your </v>

1317
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.320
<v Speaker 1>sex right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that could be traumatizing.</v>

1318
01:04:43.321 --> 01:04:45.800
<v Speaker 1>If I asked you what is your income?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well wait,</v>

1319
01:04:45.801 --> 01:04:46.634
<v Speaker 1>in some cultures that's an upfront and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could send the person into a </v>

1320
01:04:49.621 --> 01:04:50.454
<v Speaker 1>tailspin of suicide because I asked him </v>
<v Speaker 1>what his income is and so now the most </v>

1321
01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:58.050
<v Speaker 1>banal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocuous questions have to be discussed</v>

1322
01:04:58.170 --> 01:04:59.003
<v Speaker 1>for 73,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and these institutional review </v>

1323
01:05:01.261 --> 01:05:04.050
<v Speaker 1>boards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think the fulcrum now swung too far</v>

1324
01:05:04.051 --> 01:05:04.884
<v Speaker 1>the other way so that it is now stopping</v>
<v Speaker 1>good science from being done because we </v>

1325
01:05:08.311 --> 01:05:10.430
<v Speaker 1>are so afraid of harming any third </v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

1326
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:11.343
<v Speaker 1>So the good intention of we actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to harm this animal or we </v>

1327
01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:16.380
<v Speaker 1>don't want to inject a dye into a humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

1328
01:05:16.381 --> 01:05:19.500
<v Speaker 1>My blind them has become now we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to offend this person.</v>

1329
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a huge jump.</v>

1330
01:05:21.401 --> 01:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>That's dangerous for science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1331
01:05:22.991 --> 01:05:23.321
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1332
01:05:23.321 --> 01:05:24.154
<v Speaker 1>and frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the fear and my graduate students </v>

1333
01:05:26.681 --> 01:05:27.514
<v Speaker 1>when they're about to apply for a thesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>grant because they've heard all these </v>

1334
01:05:32.111 --> 01:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>horror stories that they come to me as </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor side.</v>

1335
01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>How long has the process of going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through today?</v>

1336
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.083
<v Speaker 1>And I always answered them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really depends on the makeup of the </v>

1337
01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>folks that are going to review your </v>
<v Speaker 1>application.</v>

1338
01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>If they are perfectly reasonable people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might go through an a session,</v>

1339
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.353
<v Speaker 1>if they are absolute maniacs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might take us three months of </v>

1340
01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:55.600
<v Speaker 1>rewriting this damn thing for some guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to finally accept that,</v>

1341
01:05:55.601 --> 01:05:56.434
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not injecting dye and people's </v>

1342
01:05:57.431 --> 01:06:02.320
<v Speaker 1>fear and the reality is most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>research that I get involved in,</v>

1343
01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:07.350
<v Speaker 1>although it's very rigorous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific really has no downstream harm</v>

1344
01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.673
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be caused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's unbelievable the types of </v>

1345
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:11.704
<v Speaker 1>concerns that people raised and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to rail the reign that in a </v>

1346
01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1347
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1348
01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>robotics,</v>

1349
01:06:17.651 --> 01:06:18.484
<v Speaker 1>which I've never even mentioned the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase robot to you or any of that </v>

1350
01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:22.660
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is something about,</v>

1351
01:06:22.661 --> 01:06:23.494
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting into this time with </v>

1352
01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>incredible automation and we know about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1353
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.930
<v Speaker 1>cars that are driving themselves and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that,</v>

1354
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:30.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1355
01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:30.993
<v Speaker 1>people ipads are going to put Mcdonald's</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees out of business and all of </v>

1356
01:06:33.881 --> 01:06:37.570
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How will that affect the way we evolve?</v>

1357
01:06:37.571 --> 01:06:38.404
<v Speaker 1>How do now that we're going to add this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that is completely artificial and </v>

1358
01:06:41.381 --> 01:06:42.214
<v Speaker 1>outside of us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there an evolutionary piece to that </v>

1359
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.053
<v Speaker 1>or is that something else all together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something because for evolution to </v>

1360
01:06:49.451 --> 01:06:50.284
<v Speaker 1>work right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be a selection environment </v>

1361
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:56.170
<v Speaker 1>that is if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm bored,</v>

1362
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:57.043
<v Speaker 1>let me for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For for your viewers who may not know </v>

1363
01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:01.420
<v Speaker 1>how evolution works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me explain in three seconds.</v>

1364
01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's use a male and a female.</v>

1365
01:07:04.211 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Get together through sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction.</v>

1366
01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:09.940
<v Speaker 1>They have an offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This random combination and shuffling of</v>

1367
01:07:09.941 --> 01:07:11.950
<v Speaker 1>genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>results in their offspring.</v>

1368
01:07:11.951 --> 01:07:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Having a blue.here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that blue.is</v>

1369
01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:17.910
<v Speaker 1>heritable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be passed on and if that bluedoff</v>

1370
01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.280
<v Speaker 1>confers a survival advantage to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>

1371
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:26.430
<v Speaker 1>then the selection pressures are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place for eventually that blue.to</v>

1372
01:07:26.531 --> 01:07:29.140
<v Speaker 1>become part of the makeup of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

1373
01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:30.243
<v Speaker 1>So to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have to explain to me how </v>

1374
01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.053
<v Speaker 1>there are specific selection pressures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that affect the survivability of an </v>

1375
01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:39.154
<v Speaker 1>organism or it's reproductive viability </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to be able to offer an evolution </v>

1376
01:07:42.891 --> 01:07:44.260
<v Speaker 1>argument right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of one.</v>

1377
01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does make sense.</v>

1378
01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:47.643
<v Speaker 1>I feel I can't end this on a question </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we would say doesn't make sense </v>

1379
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:51.454
<v Speaker 1>perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I will ask you this and we're going </v>

1380
01:07:53.171 --> 01:07:54.010
<v Speaker 1>to do this many more times.</v>

1381
01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.470
<v Speaker 1>You'll do this again anytime I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1382
01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking everything that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed here.</v>

1383
01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Are you hopeful or not for the future of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the West?</v>

1384
01:08:03.021 --> 01:08:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we are just caught in sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this leftist,</v>

1385
01:08:06.641 --> 01:08:07.474
<v Speaker 1>postmodern is stuff versus a nationalism</v>
<v Speaker 1>or populism that could be dangerous or </v>

1386
01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:12.814
<v Speaker 1>do you think that the enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 1>values that you care about and </v>

1387
01:08:14.651 --> 01:08:15.484
<v Speaker 1>liberalism and all that actually has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to turn this stuff around is not </v>

1388
01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:20.730
<v Speaker 1>where I need to put on my marketing hat </v>
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

1389
01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an sell it brother.</v>

1390
01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:23.503
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm going to speak about some of </v>

1391
01:08:26.661 --> 01:08:31.220
<v Speaker 1>the times when I see the tsunami of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ostrich thinking that comes my way,</v>

1392
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.353
<v Speaker 1>then I feel very pessimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel as though an utter disaster has </v>

1393
01:08:35.721 --> 01:08:38.300
<v Speaker 1>to happen before people wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

1394
01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>because I'd like to peddle hope and </v>
<v Speaker 1>market hope.</v>

1395
01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:43.003
<v Speaker 1>I think that it doesn't take too much to</v>
<v Speaker 1>redress the ship if enough silent </v>

1396
01:08:47.001 --> 01:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silent voices rise up in every ecosystem</v>

1397
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.320
<v Speaker 1>on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

1398
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.430
<v Speaker 1>in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in academia,</v>

1399
01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.680
<v Speaker 1>at the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually the,</v>

1400
01:08:58.750 --> 01:08:59.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger the courage that is necessary </v>

1401
01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 1>for them to weigh in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the voices,</v>

1402
01:09:04.641 --> 01:09:07.430
<v Speaker 1>the enemies of reason will become </v>
<v Speaker 1>marginalized,</v>

1403
01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:11.720
<v Speaker 1>but we need to rise up and that's why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always tell people when they asked me,</v>

1404
01:09:11.721 --> 01:09:12.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can I do?</v>

1405
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:13.011
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1406
01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:16.090
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have the voice of Dave</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rubin or the platform if they ruin.</v>

1407
01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:17.143
<v Speaker 1>You just have to have enough courage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take on your friends when you're </v>

1408
01:09:20.631 --> 01:09:21.464
<v Speaker 1>engaging them on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When your professor says something that </v>

1409
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:26.000
<v Speaker 1>seems like it's an affront to reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge,</v>

1410
01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:26.834
<v Speaker 1>him or her don't be silent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that if enough people do </v>

1411
01:09:29.601 --> 01:09:31.550
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the ship can be addressed.</v>

1412
01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>If we remain apathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think we will lose the I.</v>

1413
01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.760
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I always say,</v>

1414
01:09:37.761 --> 01:09:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm one guy that started a channel on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>

1415
01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.140
<v Speaker 1>You're one guy who started a channel on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>

1416
01:09:42.141 --> 01:09:42.974
<v Speaker 1>We came from very different places and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if our voices have done a little </v>

1417
01:09:45.831 --> 01:09:47.420
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's plenty of other people that</v>

1418
01:09:47.421 --> 01:09:50.720
<v Speaker 1>can replicate that and brother as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1419
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I think you guys know where his channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1420
01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.950
<v Speaker 1>but if not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out gads youtube channel a youtube</v>
