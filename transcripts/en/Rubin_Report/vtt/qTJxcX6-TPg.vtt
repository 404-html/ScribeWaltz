00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.701
<v Speaker 1>you want to in gallery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than any Batman Villain or </v>

8
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>evil theory I've ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to save the Democrats,</v>

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:35.061
<v Speaker 1>but you're trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get to that in a little </v>

10
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:37.521
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot I want to do here with </v>

11
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:37.521
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>let's talk or if an experts and a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit just about your work.</v>

13
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what got you into thrillers?</v>

14
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing I ever wanted to do is </v>

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.611
<v Speaker 1>write thrillers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my parents did not let me watch TV </v>

16
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>when I was growing up in Leicester was </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alfred Hitchcock movie on or the Red Sox</v>

17
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>were on my dad's from Boston.</v>

18
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>So that was religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>and so all that I did was read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like climbing the </v>

20
00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>bookshelves to get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>jaws on the top shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Stephen King,</v>

22
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was just into all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

23
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>by fifth grade and I was obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I still remember reading Salem's </v>

24
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like under my bed with a flashlight.</v>

25
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I was 25 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my parents were out and I remember </v>

26
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.430
<v Speaker 1>just being terrified and just thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

27
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>it's insane to me that this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King can take a combination of </v>

28
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>familiar words and put them together in </v>
<v Speaker 1>an unfamiliar way and elicit this much </v>

29
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>emotion in me and just the only thing I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do.</v>

30
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:34.311
<v Speaker 1>So I started to write these mysteries </v>
<v Speaker 1>with like crown illustrations at that </v>

31
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went to college,</v>

32
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 1>studied English and psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I met Jordan because I </v>

33
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 1>thought that'd be the best combination </v>
<v Speaker 1>of majors.</v>

34
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>And I started my first novel when I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Harvard.</v>

35
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>I went to Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Say College.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

37
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>you could say that place in Canberra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.750
<v Speaker 1>and so basically I started my first book</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 19 and then it got supremely </v>

39
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>lucky and sold it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.710
<v Speaker 1>and kind of never had to have a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

41
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>

42
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>is that how it feels to you still have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real job?</v>

43
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:07.821
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was just looking through </v>
<v Speaker 1>your wikipedia today and all the cool </v>

44
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>things that you've done and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comic books that I've grown up,</v>

45
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading and the characters that </v>

46
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>everybody cares about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

47
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I get paid to do it.</v>

48
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Like I love it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of wake up and float down the </v>

49
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>hall to my office on a barge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratitude.</v>

50
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so great.</v>

51
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:29.421
<v Speaker 1>And the comics were a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the comics are like when you get </v>

52
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:32.721
<v Speaker 1>into marvel and DC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that super rich kid who used </v>

53
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:35.331
<v Speaker 1>to live up the street from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had all the best toys and you could </v>

54
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:35.331
<v Speaker 1>go to their house and play with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>toys.</v>

55
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:36.520
<v Speaker 1>That's more vul in DC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

56
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>do you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still remember my first call for </v>

57
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>marvel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the editor in chief who's,</v>

58
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.640
<v Speaker 1>who's a very good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Axel Alonso was a fan of some of my </v>

59
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.241
<v Speaker 1>books and called and said you can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of any character from the marvel </v>

60
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:50.241
<v Speaker 1>volts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

61
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And it had to be super calm and cool and</v>
<v Speaker 1>collected,</v>

62
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 1>but my inner geek boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing cartwheels.</v>

63
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you love this stuff and it's like</v>

64
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.160
<v Speaker 1>it's in our cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said know I wanted to do the </v>

65
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>punisher because the punisher was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end all be all.</v>

66
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of punisher in orphan acts</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

67
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:09.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can a lot of Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see those and basically I wound </v>

68
00:03:09.691 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>up writing that they wanted someone from</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of Comex because garth ennis had</v>

69
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:17.461
<v Speaker 1>completed his legendary run and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to kind of reboot it and I still </v>

70
00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>remember I had this totally surreal </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience where I went to the bookstore</v>

71
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>right here on Ventura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

72
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>the comic book shop and I could no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer buy my favorite comment because I</v>

73
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:29.791
<v Speaker 1>was writing it like I already knew what </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have happened in it and it was </v>

74
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>completely real comic book in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I was wild.</v>

75
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are you more of a marvel guy or a DC </v>

76
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 1>guy to ask?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that you legally can answer</v>

77
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're more marvel.</v>

78
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more of a more.</v>

79
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I am more marvel with the exception of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman.</v>

80
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love whole spider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hardcore spider man,</v>

81
00:03:44.961 --> 00:03:49.961
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had every punisher appearance </v>

82
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:53.430
<v Speaker 1>would make of sort of the way the movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gone down because it's so clear </v>

83
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>that marvel has figured out how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>these movies correctly and at least from</v>

84
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:58.710
<v Speaker 1>my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dc or the wonder woman,</v>

85
00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>the standalone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

86
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Like they just can't quite get right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the,</v>

87
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>the original Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Christian Bale,</v>

88
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Batman's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where will those Batman's?</v>

89
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote Batman the dark night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have here?</v>

90
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:15.961
<v Speaker 1>So my Batman series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very much has an homage to those </v>

91
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:17.600
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the main Batman title,</v>

92
00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:22.601
<v Speaker 1>just Batman was Batman the dark night </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was very focused on reinventing </v>

93
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:26.701
<v Speaker 1>the villains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love villains and I love dealing with </v>

94
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>darkness and giving them a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate viewpoint,</v>

95
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.220
<v Speaker 1>which is probably part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective shifting that I think that </v>

96
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm capable of doing politics.</v>

97
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I can see a lot of other sides and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of valid reasons for it.</v>

98
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can also see this is why you can do </v>

99
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.961
<v Speaker 1>some things with Jordan because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>always talks about you have to give the </v>

100
00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 1>devil his due and I guess you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do that if you're going to write</v>

101
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 1>a good villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.550
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean the bad guy never thinks he's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad guy.</v>

104
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:51.421
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the more I think younger </v>

105
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:51.421
<v Speaker 1>writers and me included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:55.400
<v Speaker 1>my early stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the worst possible serial </v>

107
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 1>killer villain you think that makes your</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy a better force for good.</v>

108
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 1>And what you realize is if you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually build a steel man instead of a </v>

109
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>straw man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone who has a reason,</v>

110
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>rationale and worldview that we almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to relate to as a villain,</v>

111
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 1>like it's right there.</v>

112
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And then your guy defeats him even </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that chaos and ambiguity,</v>

113
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually occurs way more positively</v>

114
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>to your protagonist than if he's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>tracking serial killers all day.</v>

115
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Serial killer is inherently aren't that </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting from a narrative perspective</v>

116
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 1>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you do it?</v>

117
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's insane.</v>

118
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can find people with a real </v>

119
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.090
<v Speaker 1>rationale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I do for,</v>

120
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>it's what I really do in the orphan </v>
<v Speaker 1>access.</v>

121
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>But I did that with penguin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with scarecrow,</v>

122
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:31.940
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.050
<v Speaker 1>the mad hatter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to give them an inner life that </v>

124
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.571
<v Speaker 1>shows the reflection of Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sorta like a buffalo bill.</v>

125
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't really the interesting bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silence of the lambs.</v>

126
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.670
<v Speaker 1>It was Hannibal Lecter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

127
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Like the psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were the straight up murdering </v>

128
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.690
<v Speaker 1>psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>It was more about the intricacies of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological piece.</v>

130
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that structured like a love story.</v>

131
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a love story between Hannibal </v>

132
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Lecter and clarice starling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

133
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Didn't end that well for well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well for them it did.</v>

134
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.900
<v Speaker 1>For them it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't end that well for the guy to </v>

135
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.450
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a dance and there was a </v>

136
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.450
<v Speaker 1>flirtation and so it's very much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

137
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just very weird,</v>

138
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>twisted foray into intimacy between two </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite parties.</v>

139
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>And so it's structured out like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance.</v>

140
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>We should recut cut that as a Romcom </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

141
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's done that on youtube </v>

142
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.931
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for somebody that's interested in </v>

143
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>stories and these archetypal characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you know,</v>

144
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

145
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much truth do you think people can </v>

146
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>get out of these stories because Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>is always talking about,</v>

147
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth that you can extrapolate from </v>

148
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.161
<v Speaker 1>religious stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also it does related that you </v>

149
00:06:45.161 --> 00:06:45.161
<v Speaker 1>can get truth from well written fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

150
00:06:45.161 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talks about Harry Potter a lot or the</v>

151
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 1>story of Pinocchio or just different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things when you're writing these things.</v>

152
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Are you really keeping that in mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

153
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really interesting question.</v>

154
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

155
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I believe I'm a hardcore young yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

156
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I first studied young under Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

157
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 1>my thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anybody,</v>

158
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.260
<v Speaker 1>like if Ambien doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my thesis was 14 and young in analysis </v>

159
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>of shakespearian tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I pause it that Shakespeare was.</v>

160
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 1>His tragedies are like perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrillers,</v>

161
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're highly structured,</v>

162
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.080
<v Speaker 1>convention bound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinterpretations of past themes that </v>

163
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.981
<v Speaker 1>are narratively driven of lust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intrigue and murder designed to appeal </v>

164
00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 1>to the broadest possible cross section </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

165
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.640
<v Speaker 1>But I'm a hardcore young Ian and that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do believe that the hero myth is as </v>

166
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 1>essential and evolutionarily selected as</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposable thumbs and eyelids.</v>

167
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Like you can find a tribe cut off from </v>
<v Speaker 1>all human contact very deep in the </v>

168
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Amazon and you know they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have opposable thumbs.</v>

169
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have eyelids and you </v>

170
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.030
<v Speaker 1>know that they're going to have a hero </v>
<v Speaker 1>myth with all the constituent parts.</v>

171
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

172
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I believe is that,</v>

173
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I believe,</v>

174
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what young believes,</v>

175
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:57.371
<v Speaker 1>what Jordan talks about a lot is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's essential wisdom that's </v>

176
00:07:57.371 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 1>embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in my mind is more,</v>

177
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:03.350
<v Speaker 1>is a more real truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is that we deal with on </v>

178
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>the surface and a lot of ways of how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contend with the unknown,</v>

179
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:07.960
<v Speaker 1>both internally and externally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you buy in.</v>

180
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 1>If we were looking at the Sorta Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris Jordan debate on this,</v>

181
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:16.571
<v Speaker 1>you buy Jordan's version of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's beyond just fact that can give</v>

182
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:23.081
<v Speaker 1>us truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that there has to be some other </v>

183
00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>sort of story on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

184
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I think we're story processing and story</v>
<v Speaker 1>making machines that you can't get value</v>

185
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>out of just fact alone basically.</v>

186
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you need to.</v>

187
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>You need to embed something in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal structure.</v>

188
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>So I always think of it like we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>preconditioned to have.</v>

189
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.280
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated because people think </v>

190
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about the end collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious people think that like </v>

191
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.501
<v Speaker 1>somewhere floating in our prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex is the notion of a whiz into old </v>

192
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 1>woman as representing wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it's that.</v>

193
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a story engine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is selected that drives people to say,</v>

194
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a representation for wisdom.</v>

195
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So if you look around your village or </v>
<v Speaker 1>your city or your community,</v>

196
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 1>that will tend to land on somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>

197
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:11.270
<v Speaker 1>like it's ingrained in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's different choices that </v>

198
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:11.270
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that,</v>

199
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 1>that there is sort of essential </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifics that are floating in our head,</v>

200
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>but the mechanism to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make meaning,</v>

201
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in there and the mechanism to look </v>

202
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.211
<v Speaker 1>at different things that are in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world around us and the plugin symbols </v>

203
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:27.120
<v Speaker 1>and to make them construct a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

204
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's why if you look at like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>epic of Gilgamesh,</v>

205
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a direct overlay for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terminator,</v>

206
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

207
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:38.150
<v Speaker 1>so there's all these overlaps and nuance</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the ways that we're used to </v>

208
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.931
<v Speaker 1>processing story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the fact that it </v>

209
00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:44.811
<v Speaker 1>seems like the only thing we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly do right in Hollywood these </v>

210
00:09:44.811 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 1>days is make superhero movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there some like extra meaning to that</v>

211
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:51.771
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're making blockbuster after </v>

212
00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:53.991
<v Speaker 1>blockbuster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least marble is just blown it out of </v>

213
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:56.091
<v Speaker 1>the water with all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't seem to be making a lot of </v>

214
00:09:56.091 --> 00:09:56.091
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>original stories anymore.</v>

215
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little.</v>

216
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm divided on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

217
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 1>my favorite movie last year was wind </v>
<v Speaker 1>river.</v>

218
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that.</v>

219
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taylor Sheridan is the writer director.</v>

220
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 1>He also wrote hell or high water and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a scenario.</v>

221
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

222
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>So there's interesting work that's being</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

223
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:19.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a preponderance of </v>

224
00:10:19.461 --> 00:10:22.010
<v Speaker 1>superhero stuff because as we are sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of laying waste to some of the </v>

225
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:25.260
<v Speaker 1>structures that have protected us in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways.</v>

226
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.720
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of the new gods and the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>

227
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the case of thor literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

228
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

229
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this overlay for us to contend with</v>

230
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 1>and make meaning with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with bigger symbols in our life.</v>

231
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird.</v>

232
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I Love Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

233
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 1>You're a Batman guy to just by being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marvel guy.</v>

234
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:47.570
<v Speaker 1>But it was so funny because I was out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day and there was a guy with </v>

235
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 1>like a Batman Wallet and a Batman Tattoo</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a Batman shirt and I was like,</v>

236
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.660
<v Speaker 1>we're grown men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>

237
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.330
<v Speaker 1>What does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

238
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 1>You have a wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sorta like,</v>

239
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 1>is it that different than having a cross</v>
<v Speaker 1>around your neck?</v>

240
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Like why are we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like it,</v>

241
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 1>if you like or comment if you like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

242
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 1>why are we necessarily like ingraining </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in our skin?</v>

243
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And having that be on our,</v>

244
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.030
<v Speaker 1>on our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our clothes.</v>

245
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Like why would we wear this with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shield?</v>

246
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of religious overlay to what </v>

247
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.230
<v Speaker 1>these represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

248
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Well the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

249
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:20.220
<v Speaker 1>These stories of good and evil and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way star wars,</v>

250
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:24.150
<v Speaker 1>at least the originals affected me or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the way now.</v>

251
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:29.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get so much truth and </v>

252
00:11:29.151 --> 00:11:29.151
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

253
00:11:29.151 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 1>profound psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thought out of the,</v>

254
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original Batman trilogy.</v>

255
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:35.570
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

256
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>it's funny how good and evil and laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>waste to the world.</v>

257
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean that heath ledger joker is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

258
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

259
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's funny.</v>

260
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 1>So you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of,</v>

261
00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:49.101
<v Speaker 1>we have a direct line with star wars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways because you have a young who </v>

262
00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:50.940
<v Speaker 1>has a fairly impenetrable cannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's not breathing reading,</v>

263
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read Freud and the studies read </v>

264
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.970
<v Speaker 1>like short stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

265
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 1>so it's obvious for me in hindsight why </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied it,</v>

266
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 1>but things never make sense when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just following things that you love.</v>

267
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.120
<v Speaker 1>And I was super interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis and in hindsight it's </v>

268
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>like of course all young wrote about was</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative and all Freud wrote about was,</v>

269
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting psychological case studies </v>

270
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>which are also narrative based and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>read like short stories.</v>

271
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.020
<v Speaker 1>But so you have a young who's very tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>to penetrate.</v>

272
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.790
<v Speaker 1>So you have Joseph Campbell who came </v>
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>

273
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I think of Campbell is like the cliff </v>
<v Speaker 1>notes for young.</v>

274
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Campbell has a lot of </v>

275
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:26.400
<v Speaker 1>stuff that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.890
<v Speaker 1>like young's tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

277
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 1>he's like reading young takes a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and focus.</v>

278
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.730
<v Speaker 1>So Campbell makes that more accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Campbell had,</v>

279
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where Bill Moyer,</v>

280
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>that famous interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

281
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:42.091
<v Speaker 1>And Lucas then specifies that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific in a way and when you're </v>

282
00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:44.290
<v Speaker 1>talking about meaning in stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing,</v>

283
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:49.291
<v Speaker 1>it's like no one will deny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find meaning from Freud and </v>

284
00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:49.291
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

285
00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>But when that's distilled down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's specific,</v>

286
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:55.021
<v Speaker 1>that embodies those principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that sort of tattooed </v>

287
00:12:55.021 --> 00:12:58.921
<v Speaker 1>on our spinal cords in this culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who didn't have that experience </v>

288
00:12:58.921 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 1>with Star Wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

289
00:12:59.081 --> 00:13:04.081
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't show up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because it's taking these </v>

290
00:13:04.081 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 1>things that are literally a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>

291
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:08.550
<v Speaker 1>psychological meaning making human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings in,</v>

292
00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these bodies,</v>

293
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:14.671
<v Speaker 1>in these cannons and distilling it down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to something that everybody can plug </v>

294
00:13:14.671 --> 00:13:14.671
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

295
00:13:14.671 --> 00:13:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Whether you get it at whatever level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get it out,</v>

296
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:20.791
<v Speaker 1>you get it at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing those at seven is different than </v>

297
00:13:20.791 --> 00:13:23.101
<v Speaker 1>us seeing them at 30 or 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when Jordan takes that to the </v>

298
00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 1>religious place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

299
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.320
<v Speaker 1>do you follow that thinking there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

300
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:28.930
<v Speaker 1>and I'm from like an atheist Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.370
<v Speaker 1>my socialist background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not conventionally religiously </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready,</v>

303
00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's like to deny that a story isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>that successful.</v>

304
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.660
<v Speaker 1>So here's a weird thing that's always an</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue that I have with,</v>

305
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.690
<v Speaker 1>with Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you get very defensive when </v>

306
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:45.690
<v Speaker 1>people have problems with Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

307
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.600
<v Speaker 1>There's this funny thing where Democrats</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to view other cultures with great </v>

308
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:54.250
<v Speaker 1>reverence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the more exotic they are,</v>

309
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:59.251
<v Speaker 1>even if there's some fundamental issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other cultures that should be </v>

310
00:13:59.251 --> 00:13:59.251
<v Speaker 1>relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

311
00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:03.241
<v Speaker 1>Like you have hardcore feminists who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were supporting certain regimes that </v>

312
00:14:03.241 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 1>treat women terribly and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should jar out of that.</v>

313
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Like that appreciation for the exotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one thing I find frustrating is </v>

314
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.691
<v Speaker 1>we have such a collection of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures in the United States and it's </v>

315
00:14:12.691 --> 00:14:16.771
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't you go to Alabama or the deep </v>

316
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:16.771
<v Speaker 1>south?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the deep south.</v>

317
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Like when I sold my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drove through the deep south to go to </v>

318
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.280
<v Speaker 1>the Bourbon distilleries and a see </v>
<v Speaker 1>faulkner's home.</v>

319
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.650
<v Speaker 1>And why don't you look at that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's relationship with the second </v>

320
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.771
<v Speaker 1>amendment and their relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and their relationship with </v>

321
00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 1>their value system as also being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that is different.</v>

322
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:31.630
<v Speaker 1>That should be appreciated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

323
00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:34.090
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>

324
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 1>And so we do it for the outward world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sort of,</v>

325
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.670
<v Speaker 1>it's to be safely exotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

326
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Speaker 1>But if someone disagrees with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>

327
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.840
<v Speaker 1>this is true both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not,</v>

328
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:48.841
<v Speaker 1>I'm not merely beating up Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a frustration that I've had to </v>

329
00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:48.841
<v Speaker 1>say people think differently.</v>

330
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:53.910
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to pretend that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going jump into their brain and make a </v>

331
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.400
<v Speaker 1>moral judgement on why they hold their </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions,</v>

332
00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:00.580
<v Speaker 1>that's not good for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the same thing holds true for </v>

333
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.191
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like going to any university and </v>

334
00:15:03.191 --> 00:15:05.561
<v Speaker 1>it's super cool and hip to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to analyze the marvel stories or to </v>

335
00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:06.230
<v Speaker 1>analyze star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

336
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:11.350
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you do the same with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story that is so successful that it </v>

337
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.420
<v Speaker 1>dwarfs all of those over centuries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries that his,</v>

338
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given rise to cathedrals and,</v>

339
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:18.650
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

340
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.320
<v Speaker 1>and wars and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is stuff that is moved.</v>

341
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

342
00:15:21.731 --> 00:15:26.731
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like if you're into those </v>

343
00:15:26.731 --> 00:15:26.731
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

344
00:15:26.731 --> 00:15:26.731
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

345
00:15:26.731 --> 00:15:26.850
<v Speaker 1>that was yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

346
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.060
<v Speaker 1>you're a Jesus freak and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

347
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:34.090
<v Speaker 1>like write a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody that guys at the star wars </v>

348
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.090
<v Speaker 1>convention.</v>

349
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

350
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

351
00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:39.461
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's the story of Jesus like if </v>

352
00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:39.461
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you shoulder your own burden,</v>

353
00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:41.780
<v Speaker 1>if you bear your own cross and accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own suffering,</v>

354
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:46.781
<v Speaker 1>that's the only means toward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to transforming it or to transcending </v>

355
00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:46.781
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say.</v>

356
00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:47.300
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

357
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 1>is that relevant in relationships or </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology?</v>

358
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the best approach?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone's really screwed up and </v>

359
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:55.090
<v Speaker 1>complaining and as a murderer in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole world,</v>

360
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.930
<v Speaker 1>like you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

361
00:15:55.931 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm honey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world's awful.</v>

362
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the parenting that you want?</v>

363
00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Or to say what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the things you're doing?</v>

364
00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Where are the faults as they exist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

365
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.210
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing that Jews are great on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Old Testament.</v>

366
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.360
<v Speaker 1>God's angry we screwed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

367
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Jordan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan says that a lot.</v>

368
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like where is it centered in you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what is the way that you can accept </v>

369
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.261
<v Speaker 1>the conditions in the inherent tragedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life in a way that allows you to </v>

370
00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:18.560
<v Speaker 1>transcend that and it's like that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>played again and again and again.</v>

371
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at Tony Scott,</v>

372
00:16:21.171 --> 00:16:26.171
<v Speaker 1>Denzel Washington's a man on fire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you look at how beautifully </v>

373
00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:30.761
<v Speaker 1>that takes an hour in the first act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the relationship between him and </v>

374
00:16:30.761 --> 00:16:34.091
<v Speaker 1>the girl and it's basically a classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you need to become a monster to </v>

375
00:16:34.091 --> 00:16:37.571
<v Speaker 1>hunt monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the story of his salvation and </v>

376
00:16:37.571 --> 00:16:37.650
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice for something innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

377
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:42.670
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my favorite modern movie </v>

378
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.670
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the fact that people</v>

379
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.670
<v Speaker 1>actually care about this stuff right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

380
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:47.651
<v Speaker 1>Like this type of conversation and being</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to relate it to either comic books </v>

381
00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:51.551
<v Speaker 1>or movies and still talk about religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>or talk about it from an atheist </v>

382
00:16:51.551 --> 00:16:56.411
<v Speaker 1>perspective that people actually care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this were I think four years ago </v>

383
00:16:56.411 --> 00:16:57.370
<v Speaker 1>if have a whole bunch of us had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this,</v>

384
00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.600
<v Speaker 1>people will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

385
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Like he likes this relevant.</v>

386
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

387
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:06.010
<v Speaker 1>You guys live in your mom's basement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what they'd be saying </v>

388
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.500
<v Speaker 1>covered with snack crumbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may well be true,</v>

389
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.320
<v Speaker 1>but I cleaned up before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember that.</v>

390
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.890
<v Speaker 1>We appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

391
00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:17.891
<v Speaker 1>I think what's interesting is there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter f Scott Fitzgerald sent to his </v>

392
00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 1>editor and it's great because he talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about all the notes that you get from an</v>

393
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:24.731
<v Speaker 1>attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said the American reading public is </v>

394
00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:25.790
<v Speaker 1>totally stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be led by the nose or number</v>

395
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:30.791
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massively brilliant and can interpret </v>

396
00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:30.870
<v Speaker 1>every problem that you have more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

397
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.900
<v Speaker 1>it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so morphous view that we always </v>

398
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.730
<v Speaker 1>take toward society and so there's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of like the American attention span</v>

399
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:42.731
<v Speaker 1>is shortening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at it like we went from books </v>

400
00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:44.780
<v Speaker 1>to blogs to kind of my space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to build out to facebook,</v>

401
00:17:44.781 --> 00:17:45.860
<v Speaker 1>to twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to instagram,</v>

402
00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 1>like this ever shrinking aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's too simplistic.</v>

403
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's too simplistic,</v>

404
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:56.121
<v Speaker 1>so we have podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploding audio books and publishing </v>

405
00:17:56.121 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 1>exploding and this sort of longer form </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>

406
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think is really interesting,</v>

407
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 1>this is a lot of people were hungry for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

408
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say to Jordan and it makes no </v>

409
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.440
<v Speaker 1>sense at all that he did a lecture </v>
<v Speaker 1>series on the psychological underpinning</v>

410
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:11.060
<v Speaker 1>of the Bible and more than three people </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed up like it just.</v>

411
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.100
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't anticipate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are a lot smarter and are a </v>

412
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.850
<v Speaker 1>lot more oriented in their desire for </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

413
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Then we give credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that from being on this </v>

414
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:23.490
<v Speaker 1>tour with him in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll often say something about how he's</v>

415
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:25.650
<v Speaker 1>working on the next series of biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>exteriors.</v>

416
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.970
<v Speaker 1>It gets a huge applause every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people want more of that.</v>

417
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether they're believers or not.</v>

418
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I think many of the people that watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and appreciate them actually aren't</v>

419
00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:37.500
<v Speaker 1>believers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in a traditional sense.</v>

420
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who knows what that means.</v>

421
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I a believer or like do I believe </v>

422
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.351
<v Speaker 1>those stories contain some of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental grains of first principles </v>

423
00:18:48.351 --> 00:18:50.430
<v Speaker 1>of orienting oneself in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

424
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's like what does it even mean to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a believer?</v>

425
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.570
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the other thing I find really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting with it is that it's sort of</v>

426
00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:02.571
<v Speaker 1>going back to our conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypes and my belief that it's </v>

427
00:19:02.571 --> 00:19:05.550
<v Speaker 1>selected is we were sort of meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>making creatures and so if,</v>

428
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:10.610
<v Speaker 1>if there's a discussion that Jordan has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you guys aren't conversation on a </v>

429
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:11.370
<v Speaker 1>stage or Eric's arguing with Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

430
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 1>You get these opposing views within this</v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

431
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 1>people are engaged in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there,</v>

432
00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 1>if it feels like there's a genuine focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

433
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.920
<v Speaker 1>for meaning because it's like that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that we want more than anything </v>

434
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.980
<v Speaker 1>and it gets hijacked a lot for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose to be like,</v>

435
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.060
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be happy.</v>

436
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's like happiness is temporary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a femoral.</v>

437
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.180
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's what's happening with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these longer form discussions that </v>

438
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:40.191
<v Speaker 1>people are engaged in is because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels like there's something real </v>

439
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:43.041
<v Speaker 1>happening and it's not buzzwords and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliches and facile dismissals.</v>

440
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.970
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's real.</v>

441
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like also at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream has become so meaningless,</v>

442
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:55.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That our ability to just do this and </v>

443
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.371
<v Speaker 1>have a little bit of an exchange maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some differences and some </v>

444
00:19:58.371 --> 00:20:01.521
<v Speaker 1>agreements has that much more value </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now where 10 years ago maybe it </v>

445
00:20:01.521 --> 00:20:05.781
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have had so much value but the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as mainstream careens off into the </v>

446
00:20:05.781 --> 00:20:06.480
<v Speaker 1>abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

447
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.770
<v Speaker 1>we're still here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

448
00:20:07.771 --> 00:20:12.771
<v Speaker 1>it's funny too because in some ways a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable centrist view is now radical,</v>

449
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:18.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a senator who's willing </v>

450
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.950
<v Speaker 1>to compromise and interact with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side to pass legislation,</v>

451
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.340
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the tenants of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress had was the right,</v>

452
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.030
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of radical.</v>

453
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Like if you don't only vilify and shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>down from either side and,</v>

454
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.480
<v Speaker 1>and continue to polarize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually,</v>

455
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

456
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.900
<v Speaker 1>part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking a lot about how this </v>

457
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.971
<v Speaker 1>has driven with mainstream media and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I were talking a little bit about </v>

458
00:20:40.971 --> 00:20:45.351
<v Speaker 1>trying to use the intellectual dark web </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an ability to sort of broaden out </v>

459
00:20:45.351 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 1>what views are of different parties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:52.351
<v Speaker 1>it's all heterodoxy base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like how do we bring in centrist </v>

461
00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:55.921
<v Speaker 1>views and have them represented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things I've been </v>

462
00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:58.531
<v Speaker 1>thinking about a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing a lot of candidate </v>

463
00:20:58.531 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to dozens of candidates from</v>

464
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Tennessee to Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all over the country.</v>

465
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Virtually no one that I talked to is </v>
<v Speaker 1>making it a key key aspect of their </v>

466
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

467
00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:12.250
<v Speaker 1>trans bathrooms in democratic socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally not a one.</v>

468
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 1>So then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

469
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:16.150
<v Speaker 1>is there a role that we're all playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

470
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 1>even in this umbrella of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>

471
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:19.420
<v Speaker 1>dark web.</v>

472
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.420
<v Speaker 1>But then the mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who's sort of virtue signaling </v>

473
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 1>on social media in starting to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

474
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Eric calls it the Chihuahua fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

475
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 1>there's very loud people who are out at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edges and like maybe good for them,</v>

476
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:36.991
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not in favor of d platforming </v>

477
00:21:36.991 --> 00:21:39.061
<v Speaker 1>anybody on either on either edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a huge story in the middle </v>

478
00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:42.230
<v Speaker 1>that I think isn't being told and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's really important to,</v>

479
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:42.910
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

480
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.360
<v Speaker 1>to have the Chihuahua fact not cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the middle from being able </v>

481
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:50.770
<v Speaker 1>to sort of speak up and have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse that they want to have.</v>

482
00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.870
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat down with the,</v>

483
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 1>with the Washington Post have sat down </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some other places and said,</v>

484
00:21:56.591 --> 00:22:01.591
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>count the number of times that you've </v>

485
00:22:01.591 --> 00:22:01.591
<v Speaker 1>written about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

486
00:22:01.591 --> 00:22:01.591
<v Speaker 1>it costs ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

487
00:22:01.591 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she won in a very deep blue district,</v>

488
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:03.490
<v Speaker 1>like good on her.</v>

489
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Go off in the Bronx and when and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

490
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.440
<v Speaker 1>what's going to work there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not my proclivity,</v>

491
00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:13.441
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not denigrating that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like how many times have you </v>

492
00:22:13.441 --> 00:22:14.560
<v Speaker 1>written about her verse versus Angie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Craig Halley,</v>

493
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Steven's Joseph crops or Ken Harbor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these amazing former military pro</v>

494
00:22:19.121 --> 00:22:21.360
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing Democratic candidates.</v>

495
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.630
<v Speaker 1>But I'm guessing that 90 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people watching,</v>

496
00:22:23.631 --> 00:22:28.631
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard one of those names and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she said she was all over everything </v>

497
00:22:28.631 --> 00:22:30.760
<v Speaker 1>endlessly for weeks and everyone does </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

498
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:33.730
<v Speaker 1>So I've been trying to think about why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why that is the case,</v>

499
00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:38.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would bet if you go to the New York </v>

500
00:22:38.731 --> 00:22:38.731
<v Speaker 1>Times or the Washington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's mentioned,</v>

501
00:22:38.731 --> 00:22:43.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 x 20 x these other candidates if not </v>

502
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 1>even more so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think from the right it makes sense.</v>

503
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:50.670
<v Speaker 1>And the left does this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is not me claiming that the </v>

504
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.671
<v Speaker 1>rights owner who does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense to paint the parties </v>

505
00:22:53.671 --> 00:22:56.191
<v Speaker 1>further left than it is because it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier sort of target to paint the </v>

506
00:22:56.191 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Speaker 1>furthest extreme and then to denigrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

507
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.360
<v Speaker 1>But with the left they're doing it also </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because there's problems and </v>

508
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.570
<v Speaker 1>they need clickbait and eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's that.</v>

509
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's also a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>curious.</v>

510
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a curious desire on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left sometimes to continue to be </v>

511
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:14.410
<v Speaker 1>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

512
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:19.411
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if sometimes there's a drive to app to </v>

513
00:23:19.411 --> 00:23:22.360
<v Speaker 1>to further the stories that are stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in fact are going to hurt the left.</v>

514
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.470
<v Speaker 1>An example of that is when we talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress that's being made,</v>

515
00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of progress being made in </v>
<v Speaker 1>race relations for,</v>

516
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.340
<v Speaker 1>for women in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a propensity for the left to say</v>

517
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:38.790
<v Speaker 1>everything's bad as it ever was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's gotten better and you go </v>

518
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:39.280
<v Speaker 1>really like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like today it's the same.</v>

519
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not to say that there isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic widespread racism,</v>

520
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it really the same as in during,</v>

521
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 1>before the civil rights is really the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same as in Jim Crow,</v>

522
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 1>that nothing's changed and it comes.</v>

523
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.170
<v Speaker 1>I think from a concern that if you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that things are better than everyone</v>

524
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 1>will just give up and go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like a driver to it.</v>

525
00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.080
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that there's this aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>with how the left engages with progress </v>

526
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 1>and what candidates that it looks at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's almost.</v>

527
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 1>And I think the right does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has its own version of this.</v>

528
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:11.561
<v Speaker 1>There's almost a desire to be constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset and outraged or to constantly be </v>

529
00:24:11.561 --> 00:24:16.061
<v Speaker 1>under the heel of what's viewed as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side and what I'm noticing a lot </v>

530
00:24:16.061 --> 00:24:19.841
<v Speaker 1>in the discourse that is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>advocated or is the most widely spread </v>

531
00:24:19.841 --> 00:24:24.041
<v Speaker 1>is there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a real sort of martyr mentality </v>

532
00:24:24.041 --> 00:24:25.430
<v Speaker 1>that lies beneath the outrage from </v>
<v Speaker 1>either side.</v>

533
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's just back up a little bit </v>

534
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we come from a pretty similar </v>

535
00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.521
<v Speaker 1>political backgrounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both pretty much democrats our whole </v>

536
00:24:36.521 --> 00:24:36.560
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both part of the left,</v>

537
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

538
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I think we differ a little bit now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I basically think that ship has </v>

539
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.190
<v Speaker 1>sailed on this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

540
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I do think that the left has just rotted</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats from the inside.</v>

541
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:52.571
<v Speaker 1>I get that there are these good people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I look forward to having many of </v>

542
00:24:52.571 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 1>them sit in that very chair and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope that some things can return,</v>

543
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's going to get a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse before it gets better.</v>

544
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 1>You're really trying to help the </v>
<v Speaker 1>messaging of this thing,</v>

545
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 1>the focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the messaging,</v>

546
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.020
<v Speaker 1>but basically it get rid of some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics stuff.</v>

547
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe stop doing so much class warfare </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

548
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I think a few other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few other pieces of this convinced me </v>

549
00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.380
<v Speaker 1>that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>

550
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

551
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:22.310
<v Speaker 1>First of all that I bet if we sat down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and did a chart of our political views,</v>

552
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I think years in minor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the closest of anybody in the </v>

553
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.261
<v Speaker 1>intellectual dark web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you and I are probably aligned on </v>

554
00:25:32.261 --> 00:25:33.170
<v Speaker 1>everything from gun discipline to </v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion.</v>

555
00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go down the list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

556
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.080
<v Speaker 1>and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the biggest difference is like </v>

557
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.310
<v Speaker 1>you've left the party and you and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to write.</v>

558
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I haven't joined a new party but just </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the record,</v>

559
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 1>but I don't consider myself a democratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>political.</v>

560
00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:49.900
<v Speaker 1>If that's a party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll join that party.</v>

561
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying to kind of refocus the </v>

562
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 1>party in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

563
00:25:55.130 --> 00:26:00.130
<v Speaker 1>that lives up to the promise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it has specifically to when </v>

564
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:00.130
<v Speaker 1>people like you back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

565
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:05.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a long road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of hurdles and there's a </v>

566
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.501
<v Speaker 1>lot of quagmires and we have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of errors that have been</v>

567
00:26:11.001 --> 00:26:16.001
<v Speaker 1>made and I think that one of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that corruption is a very </v>

568
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:21.671
<v Speaker 1>widespread problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the Democrats can </v>

569
00:26:21.671 --> 00:26:24.350
<v Speaker 1>continue to make an argument that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the less corruptive to parties.</v>

570
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a winning argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

571
00:26:26.581 --> 00:26:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I think you could probably make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter argument pretty easily,</v>

572
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Democrats did a lot of stuff </v>

573
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.641
<v Speaker 1>against Bernie and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Donna Brazil and the questions to </v>

574
00:26:36.641 --> 00:26:39.881
<v Speaker 1>hillary and all sorts of other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could argue there are probably </v>

575
00:26:39.881 --> 00:26:41.450
<v Speaker 1>more corrupt and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be another.</v>

576
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think that's an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument to have any anymore because I </v>

577
00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 1>think put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's assume from my perspective,</v>

578
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.950
<v Speaker 1>let's just take the leap to say I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe the Democrats are less corrupt </v>

579
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.950
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

580
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:56.720
<v Speaker 1>than what is happening right now under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under this administration and some of </v>

581
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:56.720
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

582
00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we can have an argument </v>

583
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.630
<v Speaker 1>that says vote for us were corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just kind of lost.</v>

584
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a winning argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if we're going to engage </v>

585
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.640
<v Speaker 1>with people like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

586
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians,</v>

587
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>

588
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.180
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they're going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to corruption validly.</v>

589
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

590
00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:17.310
<v Speaker 1>you want to clean up corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

591
00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:22.311
<v Speaker 1>You first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a reasonable first claim for </v>

592
00:27:22.311 --> 00:27:22.710
<v Speaker 1>people who have been in the party and </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that they're lost.</v>

593
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:28.070
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of the hope that I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the party or these new candidates </v>

594
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 1>and voices and as part of my dismay </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the way that it's painted that the</v>

595
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:35.420
<v Speaker 1>far left is what's getting the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention or,</v>

596
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.780
<v Speaker 1>or like the ridiculous stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens on college campuses.</v>

597
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of the attention that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like claiming that every person </v>

598
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.160
<v Speaker 1>who's on the right is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you know,</v>

599
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.160
<v Speaker 1>a radicalized neo Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

600
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.070
<v Speaker 1>so where is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is the internal push back on that?</v>

601
00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:58.071
<v Speaker 1>Because I can see it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that from someone that was always a </v>

602
00:27:58.071 --> 00:27:59.040
<v Speaker 1>lefty and a Democrat and a progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing,</v>

603
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.340
<v Speaker 1>and now although I still consider myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal,</v>

604
00:28:01.341 --> 00:28:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone sat me for four hours here,</v>

605
00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I could probably get to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say I'm a libertarian.</v>

606
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I see ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual flexibility on the right.</v>

607
00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:13.290
<v Speaker 1>These days I see a libertarian side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the never trumpers,</v>

608
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I see the trumpers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see sort of the Mug lefties.</v>

609
00:28:16.351 --> 00:28:21.351
<v Speaker 1>Like I do see like a couple of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>pillars that are all sort of lefties,</v>

610
00:28:21.811 --> 00:28:23.250
<v Speaker 1>the Mug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mug lefties.</v>

611
00:28:23.251 --> 00:28:25.160
<v Speaker 1>What I would say like I feel like a mug </v>
<v Speaker 1>lefty.</v>

612
00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that I see like a couple of </v>

613
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.410
<v Speaker 1>different groups that are thought of on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right right now that differ on </v>

614
00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:37.671
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically you're agreeing to </v>

615
00:28:37.671 --> 00:28:37.671
<v Speaker 1>disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that on the left,</v>

616
00:28:37.671 --> 00:28:39.840
<v Speaker 1>but you just mentioned a couple of names</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you believe are people will.</v>

617
00:28:39.841 --> 00:28:44.841
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think is happening and it </v>

618
00:28:44.841 --> 00:28:44.841
<v Speaker 1>goes to your point about where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen is,</v>

619
00:28:44.841 --> 00:28:45.720
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

620
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.220
<v Speaker 1>if there's some evidence of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

621
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see it in here as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trail of candidates.</v>

622
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:51.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

623
00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I could list 20 candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I won't just rattle off,</v>

624
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.570
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't necessarily know,</v>

625
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:03.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katie Hill and Haley Stevens and Kendra </v>

626
00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Horn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dealing with people everyday who </v>

627
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.700
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about number one thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>anticorruption and they're signing.</v>

628
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.710
<v Speaker 1>I asked yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at an event with six candidates </v>

629
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:13.120
<v Speaker 1>and Adam Schiff and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

630
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working with others.</v>

631
00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Instead of all of you signed on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disclose act,</v>

632
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.090
<v Speaker 1>disclose act is vowing to a name </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists,</v>

633
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.820
<v Speaker 1>all lobbyist influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all to get money out of politics,</v>

634
00:29:23.821 --> 00:29:28.821
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is the number one issue </v>

635
00:29:28.821 --> 00:29:28.821
<v Speaker 1>isn't business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

636
00:29:28.821 --> 00:29:31.480
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of the donor class level and </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of lobbyists.</v>

637
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that's a really big </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

638
00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do you disclose everybody?</v>

639
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:41.150
<v Speaker 1>You disclose your donors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to talk more about from </v>

640
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.281
<v Speaker 1>a libertarian perspective in a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we had a very interesting </v>

641
00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:44.410
<v Speaker 1>conversation with Ben that shifted some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my thinking on that.</v>

642
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

643
00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 1>You going to name all your lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to come out for protection</v>

644
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:50.710
<v Speaker 1>of the vote no matter what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

645
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to come out hard against </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking pac money for individual </v>

646
00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.310
<v Speaker 1>candidates or like bombing the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side through a pack,</v>

647
00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 1>a anti Gerrymandering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

648
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Which means either a bi partisan </v>
<v Speaker 1>committee that does it,</v>

649
00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:06.460
<v Speaker 1>which has some problems or judicial or </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm increasingly starting to think about</v>

650
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a congress congressional fix,</v>

651
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:10.510
<v Speaker 1>like if you're really great job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress doing a lot more.</v>

652
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if they did anything right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's swearing a bunch of things </v>

653
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:19.351
<v Speaker 1>before they're going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's dozens and dozens of names on </v>

654
00:30:19.351 --> 00:30:22.741
<v Speaker 1>the list of people who have signed onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>this call is to act and I believe </v>

655
00:30:22.741 --> 00:30:23.140
<v Speaker 1>they're all democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all younger Democrats.</v>

656
00:30:23.141 --> 00:30:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Would this wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the disclosed thing is troubling for</v>

657
00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:28.460
<v Speaker 1>me because you get stupid stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

658
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:32.670
<v Speaker 1>this in and out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a boycott that lasted a day and a half,</v>

659
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.550
<v Speaker 1>which if people aren't familiar with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think somebody called it,</v>

660
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:40.590
<v Speaker 1>they found out the in and out had </v>
<v Speaker 1>donated to Republicans and called for a </v>

661
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.900
<v Speaker 1>boycott and the best thing in southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

662
00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 1>everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

663
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.960
<v Speaker 1>that's in and out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

664
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not happening.</v>

665
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:50.610
<v Speaker 1>But then they found out that they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>given money to Democrats and like the </v>

666
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.491
<v Speaker 1>whole thing is this mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so and I understand and things are </v>

667
00:30:53.491 --> 00:30:56.431
<v Speaker 1>also complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Nike Right now has Colin </v>

668
00:30:56.431 --> 00:30:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Kaepernick's the face of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're calling him a $6,000,000,000</v>

669
00:30:57.251 --> 00:31:02.251
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They rent the ground floor of trump </v>

670
00:31:02.251 --> 00:31:02.251
<v Speaker 1>tower for $13,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

671
00:31:02.251 --> 00:31:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've given three times as much money </v>

672
00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:06.560
<v Speaker 1>to Republicans and Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like who are we boycotting?</v>

673
00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.461
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile there's a sandwich chain </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just got put out of business </v>

674
00:31:11.461 --> 00:31:12.160
<v Speaker 1>because the owner took a picture with </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

675
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like from both sides,</v>

676
00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:15.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing?</v>

677
00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's burning there Nike's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually paying $30,000,000</v>

678
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:20.290
<v Speaker 1>to rent space and are giving three act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

679
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:25.291
<v Speaker 1>They're using sweatshops in China or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam or wherever and now suddenly </v>

680
00:31:25.291 --> 00:31:29.971
<v Speaker 1>everyone on the left school with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want to support Nike </v>

681
00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:32.520
<v Speaker 1>because right in the eds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also everybody in the right is sort </v>

682
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.720
<v Speaker 1>of outraged by this move and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning their shoes.</v>

683
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.720
<v Speaker 1>But Nike also was given three act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like let's not look for our moral </v>

684
00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.960
<v Speaker 1>guidance maybe from corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe that's a good.</v>

685
00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:45.961
<v Speaker 1>So that that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say not your moral guidance nor </v>

686
00:31:45.961 --> 00:31:49.860
<v Speaker 1>from politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should be getting it </v>

687
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Speaker 1>from politicians or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people look at politicians now as</v>

688
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:55.861
<v Speaker 1>if they're supposed to be superheroes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just people who are middle </v>

689
00:31:55.861 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 1>management pushing things one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another a little bit,</v>

690
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:04.380
<v Speaker 1>but instead we want people to come in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with magical powers and fix things that </v>

691
00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.790
<v Speaker 1>haven't been able to be fixed for all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

692
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are certain standards to </v>

693
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:14.110
<v Speaker 1>which we want politicians held.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we want doctors and lawyers.</v>

694
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:19.200
<v Speaker 1>There are certain oats of the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone's life is being run by </v>

695
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:19.570
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a problem,</v>

696
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.790
<v Speaker 1>but to go back just real quickly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

697
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.640
<v Speaker 1>to that concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is if you just close everything,</v>

698
00:32:24.641 --> 00:32:26.600
<v Speaker 1>then people can kind of mob you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>boycott you,</v>

699
00:32:26.601 --> 00:32:29.980
<v Speaker 1>and we've seen that from both sides in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that just becomes a mess.</v>

700
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.980
<v Speaker 1>And then companies like my one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest protest actually isn't a moral.</v>

701
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:40.350
<v Speaker 1>It's that it makes everything boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes it so dull that anytime </v>

702
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:42.290
<v Speaker 1>somebody takes her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a comedian.</v>

703
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Guests what you live on the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you live on the edge,</v>

704
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:49.451
<v Speaker 1>you're going to say stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it doesn't play or stuff </v>

705
00:32:49.451 --> 00:32:49.451
<v Speaker 1>that's offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at Richard Pryor.</v>

706
00:32:49.451 --> 00:32:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Look at Eddie Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at Dave Chappelle.</v>

707
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:55.870
<v Speaker 1>You know you're a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole game is to do that and </v>

708
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.501
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're going to miss and fall down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then got a cell phone in the in the </v>

709
00:32:59.501 --> 00:33:03.521
<v Speaker 1>crowd waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just waiting to click send and then </v>

710
00:33:03.521 --> 00:33:03.521
<v Speaker 1>there's that word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>craven nonsense.</v>

711
00:33:03.521 --> 00:33:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Apologies to who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is,</v>

712
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:10.810
<v Speaker 1>who is like curled in a fetal position </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their shower scrubbing themselves </v>

713
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.900
<v Speaker 1>because Dave Rubin made a joke that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean about something like I just don't.</v>

714
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Who are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do people apologize too?</v>

715
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:18.500
<v Speaker 1>But so one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

716
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:21.680
<v Speaker 1>and I know that this is an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is one of the other things I</v>

717
00:33:21.681 --> 00:33:26.681
<v Speaker 1>know that disclosing is a problem from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian perspective because why </v>

718
00:33:26.681 --> 00:33:29.831
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't people just give money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that somebody in La and </v>

719
00:33:29.831 --> 00:33:31.790
<v Speaker 1>they're Christian and they give money to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pro family,</v>

720
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:36.791
<v Speaker 1>anti gay marriage group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe they don't want to be </v>

721
00:33:36.791 --> 00:33:36.791
<v Speaker 1>out and if it means they're never going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work again.</v>

722
00:33:36.791 --> 00:33:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I understand those concerns.</v>

723
00:33:39.261 --> 00:33:43.220
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I'm sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of discussing and advocating is to raise</v>

724
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.580
<v Speaker 1>the floor of that to some number and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what it is,</v>

725
00:33:46.581 --> 00:33:49.220
<v Speaker 1>but these are conversations that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being had internally.</v>

726
00:33:49.221 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 1>And obviously the Democratic Party is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one pushing all this.</v>

727
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:56.591
<v Speaker 1>This is not my invention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is something that I find to be </v>

728
00:33:56.591 --> 00:33:56.750
<v Speaker 1>important with the candidates who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>running to talk about,</v>

729
00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 1>but maybe there's some floor where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

730
00:33:58.731 --> 00:33:59.590
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>

731
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 1>or $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>give what you want and it's secret,</v>

732
00:34:02.661 --> 00:34:07.661
<v Speaker 1>but if you're giving over $10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be political player and </v>

733
00:34:07.661 --> 00:34:11.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe have the spine to stand behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>your money then and I know that that's </v>

734
00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.861
<v Speaker 1>not like I will concede that that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>running against the current of what a </v>

735
00:34:14.861 --> 00:34:17.660
<v Speaker 1>libertarian argument would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm weighing that against,</v>

736
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dark money that no one knows</v>

737
00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 1>where it's from.</v>

738
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:25.660
<v Speaker 1>If it's in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the country going up to take out </v>

739
00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:25.660
<v Speaker 1>candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

740
00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:27.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a sacrifice that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in making.</v>

741
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of those middle ground </v>

742
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:32.480
<v Speaker 1>things that I think is worth having the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about because I don't.</v>

743
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm not someone that would say there </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be no government involvement in </v>

744
00:34:36.401 --> 00:34:36.650
<v Speaker 1>any of their shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to figure out,</v>

745
00:34:36.651 --> 00:34:41.651
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a real player in </v>

746
00:34:41.651 --> 00:34:43.541
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe that does have to disclose </v>

747
00:34:43.541 --> 00:34:43.541
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually does make sense to me.</v>

748
00:34:43.541 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately this isn't where you get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of headlines of,</v>

749
00:34:45.471 --> 00:34:50.471
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are trying to figure out what </v>

750
00:34:50.471 --> 00:34:52.121
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fair balances on what to </v>

751
00:34:52.121 --> 00:34:52.121
<v Speaker 1>disclose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wouldn't it be cool?</v>

752
00:34:52.121 --> 00:34:56.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like we have this thing and it's </v>

753
00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:56.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I talked so much about</v>
<v Speaker 1>messaging.</v>

754
00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Speaker 1>You walk into a big rally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

755
00:34:56.931 --> 00:34:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I believe universal healthcare is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

756
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's immediately in their camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

757
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's cheering and it's wonderful.</v>

758
00:35:04.341 --> 00:35:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Or like there's no way I worked so hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole life.</v>

759
00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I paid for my own healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't people do it?</v>

760
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And what you just said about there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable ground in the middle.</v>

761
00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these are conversations I think that</v>

762
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:16.730
<v Speaker 1>are essential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything's in the middle.</v>

763
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

764
00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:18.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

765
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:23.830
<v Speaker 1>we think everyone should have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard of healthcare so people aren't </v>

766
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 1>dying in the streets in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

767
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:27.860
<v Speaker 1>That's an American and it's unethical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a massive public health issue.</v>

768
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 1>If people just die in their bodies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotting and Mr also paying for it either</v>

769
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

770
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.170
<v Speaker 1>So like still it's an economic argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's not pretend,</v>

771
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.200
<v Speaker 1>let's not fight over an abstract notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of whether universal healthcare is a </v>

772
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 1>right or a privilege like that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do anything for people who need</v>

773
00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.100
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>

774
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.230
<v Speaker 1>So instead do we look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

775
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.640
<v Speaker 1>average cost of an emergency room visit </v>
<v Speaker 1>is $1,233</v>

776
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.820
<v Speaker 1>hospital passes onto an insurance </v>
<v Speaker 1>company who passes it on to us because </v>

777
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.840
<v Speaker 1>they're uninsured and our rates go up or</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccination is $19.</v>

778
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:03.290
<v Speaker 1>So let's have some dollars and cents </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions and let's also talk to </v>

779
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:07.011
<v Speaker 1>people from around the table even who we</v>
<v Speaker 1>might disagree with about how we get </v>

780
00:36:07.011 --> 00:36:11.001
<v Speaker 1>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was interesting because I was on </v>

781
00:36:11.001 --> 00:36:11.730
<v Speaker 1>with Jordan when we jumped on the phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Ben when I was talking through some</v>

782
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:16.731
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was trying to figure out if </v>

783
00:36:16.731 --> 00:36:16.731
<v Speaker 1>there's any good argument for </v>
<v Speaker 1>gerrymandering.</v>

784
00:36:16.731 --> 00:36:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Aside from the fact that everyone from </v>
<v Speaker 1>either party just gets to keep their </v>

785
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:23.130
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why would you literally the points of</v>

786
00:36:23.131 --> 00:36:25.440
<v Speaker 1>interest to me is to call someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and be like,</v>

787
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:28.530
<v Speaker 1>make an argument for gerrymandering so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can know what it is.</v>

788
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.310
<v Speaker 1>And so I was kind of having this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and,</v>

789
00:36:31.311 --> 00:36:36.311
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting pushback from Ben about this </v>

790
00:36:36.311 --> 00:36:37.620
<v Speaker 1>disclosure thing for exactly the in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>out reasons and it's like,</v>

791
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:39.690
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he and I aren't going to agree,</v>

792
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's,</v>

793
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:45.710
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna see his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his opinion is get all money out of </v>

794
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.790
<v Speaker 1>government and then no one's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete for it.</v>

795
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different solution to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one that I advocate.</v>

796
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Speaker 1>But in hearing that I think there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to,</v>

797
00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:55.660
<v Speaker 1>to address concerns that reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will have to say I want to give </v>

798
00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.070
<v Speaker 1>to $2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>through candidate.</v>

799
00:36:56.071 --> 00:37:01.071
<v Speaker 1>I don't want the whole neighborhood to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know like what if it's more liberal and </v>

800
00:37:01.071 --> 00:37:01.071
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

801
00:37:01.071 --> 00:37:04.890
<v Speaker 1>What if it's more conservative and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>in San Francisco and so the ways to sort</v>

802
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:09.120
<v Speaker 1>of hear where people are coming from and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out ways to discuss that.</v>

803
00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:14.120
<v Speaker 1>And so the biggest hope when you said to</v>
<v Speaker 1>convince me for me is this next </v>

804
00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 1>generation of leadership in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Party.</v>

805
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.220
<v Speaker 1>There is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

806
00:37:17.221 --> 00:37:22.221
<v Speaker 1>there's a Guy Joseph Kopser in Texas who</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years he was an army ranger,</v>

807
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.200
<v Speaker 1>a professor at West Point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the Kennedy School,</v>

808
00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:27.630
<v Speaker 1>got a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started his own business,</v>

809
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:32.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>created hundreds of jobs for people in </v>

810
00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Texas and is now running for a seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting guy,</v>

811
00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.340
<v Speaker 1>very common sense geared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes into churches,</v>

812
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:40.341
<v Speaker 1>goes into Republican strongholds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sits down and we'll have a conversation </v>

813
00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:41.640
<v Speaker 1>with anybody could sit here and hold his</v>
<v Speaker 1>own with you.</v>

814
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:46.670
<v Speaker 1>So this does show why the media or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way they frame all this is so much of </v>

815
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:50.130
<v Speaker 1>the problem because no one has heard of </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of these people.</v>

816
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:53.280
<v Speaker 1>And if you control the information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting,</v>

817
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.600
<v Speaker 1>we're shifting the views on the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel the same way an inverse about</v>

818
00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.620
<v Speaker 1>trump voters.</v>

819
00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing from them.</v>

820
00:38:00.271 --> 00:38:05.271
<v Speaker 1>And people are saying it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's guys with torches at midnight </v>

821
00:38:05.271 --> 00:38:05.271
<v Speaker 1>protecting confederate statues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

822
00:38:05.271 --> 00:38:10.191
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an incredibly wide array of </v>

823
00:38:10.191 --> 00:38:12.891
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a very broad cross section of </v>

824
00:38:12.891 --> 00:38:15.321
<v Speaker 1>friends who voted for trump and it's too</v>
<v Speaker 1>widespread for me to dismiss everybody </v>

825
00:38:15.901 --> 00:38:18.300
<v Speaker 1>as being mouth breathing troglodytes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

826
00:38:18.301 --> 00:38:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I've very smart friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends who were in the military,</v>

827
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.700
<v Speaker 1>there are a bunch of people made </v>
<v Speaker 1>different decisions.</v>

828
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:28.701
<v Speaker 1>There's people who think that we need </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything as long as it wasn't another </v>

829
00:38:28.701 --> 00:38:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Bush or another Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what it is.</v>

830
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:34.990
<v Speaker 1>They wanted a disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it's really important.</v>

831
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Look at the way that the media is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tailoring that.</v>

832
00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:41.590
<v Speaker 1>And part of what I think our job is are </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like us,</v>

833
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 1>is to sort of cut through that and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try and have a conversation about what's</v>

834
00:38:45.941 --> 00:38:46.900
<v Speaker 1>really going on.</v>

835
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.430
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Democrats,</v>

836
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:50.020
<v Speaker 1>it's like I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

837
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean have people sit down or look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

838
00:38:53.141 --> 00:38:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Angie Craig or Kendra Horn or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can harbaugh's someone I just spoke with</v>

839
00:38:57.761 --> 00:38:58.480
<v Speaker 1>last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

840
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:03.481
<v Speaker 1>another guy was in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't emergency relief a organization </v>

841
00:39:03.481 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 1>afterwards health 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like you talk to him.</v>

842
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:07.690
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about healthcare and jobs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and education.</v>

843
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:12.730
<v Speaker 1>And when you say that most of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks are against identity politics and </v>

844
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:16.510
<v Speaker 1>just sort of the general state of when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk about the left,</v>

845
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 1>what it's become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you say that they're in opposition</v>

846
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:23.980
<v Speaker 1>to what I think are most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerning part of the left?</v>

847
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.540
<v Speaker 1>The concerning parts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

848
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean what's hard is at least the parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we seem to be concerned about,</v>

849
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:34.380
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's hard with identity </v>

850
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.211
<v Speaker 1>politics is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of these terms that means very </v>

851
00:39:36.211 --> 00:39:36.211
<v Speaker 1>different things to different people.</v>

852
00:39:36.211 --> 00:39:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people are like identity and </v>

853
00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.581
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm African American and have an </v>

854
00:39:41.581 --> 00:39:44.851
<v Speaker 1>issue with actual statistics on </v>
<v Speaker 1>imprisonment rates or police brutality </v>

855
00:39:44.851 --> 00:39:48.960
<v Speaker 1>and ways that that skews is one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying you can't have cultural </v>

856
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.590
<v Speaker 1>appropriation and I'm melting down over </v>
<v Speaker 1>white male privilege because you know,</v>

857
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Justin timberlake has a braiding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hair is another thing and all of </v>

858
00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:01.180
<v Speaker 1>those are sort of different and chopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and it's like I like for me,</v>

859
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.420
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I haven't had one conversation </v>

860
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.061
<v Speaker 1>about trans bathrooms or white male </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege or any of these things with </v>

861
00:40:09.061 --> 00:40:12.601
<v Speaker 1>the candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that they are not more </v>

862
00:40:12.601 --> 00:40:15.391
<v Speaker 1>inclined based on their political </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation and their big five </v>

863
00:40:15.391 --> 00:40:15.391
<v Speaker 1>personality traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

864
00:40:15.391 --> 00:40:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Or empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher openness to have sympathy for </v>

865
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.970
<v Speaker 1>those arguments or the arguments that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are beneath those arguments where people</v>

866
00:40:21.971 --> 00:40:26.971
<v Speaker 1>are coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the very far left stuff about it </v>

867
00:40:26.971 --> 00:40:28.630
<v Speaker 1>like a day without white people at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Evergreen.</v>

868
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Evergreen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brass.</v>

869
00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hearing that stuff anywhere.</v>

870
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.160
<v Speaker 1>So it gets a little tricky because for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me I feel like we can't have it be that </v>

871
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.410
<v Speaker 1>all immigration is bad or all </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration is good.</v>

872
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you were talking about meeting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle with stuff.</v>

873
00:40:43.481 --> 00:40:48.481
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone in this country is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the descendant of an immigrant </v>

874
00:40:48.481 --> 00:40:48.481
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

875
00:40:48.481 --> 00:40:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Unless you were native American or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or brought here.</v>

876
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:53.680
<v Speaker 1>And we also can make an argument that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all immigration is good.</v>

877
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:58.770
<v Speaker 1>So maybe if we could put down those bats</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were beating each other with and </v>

878
00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:01.570
<v Speaker 1>actually sit down and talk to what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerns are.</v>

879
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.890
<v Speaker 1>It could be a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said something very interesting about</v>

880
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.350
<v Speaker 1>when you were on with banner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben was on with you.</v>

881
00:41:08.351 --> 00:41:13.351
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about abortion and </v>

882
00:41:13.351 --> 00:41:13.351
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

883
00:41:13.351 --> 00:41:13.351
<v Speaker 1>you support choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

884
00:41:13.351 --> 00:41:17.050
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself begrudgingly pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice and I cut off basically.</v>

885
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like you,</v>

886
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.640
<v Speaker 1>you conceded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was really interesting </v>

887
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.071
<v Speaker 1>because I'm always trying to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this issue and to approach an issue </v>

888
00:41:26.071 --> 00:41:29.251
<v Speaker 1>that's incredibly emotional with like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually is an issue with very good </v>

889
00:41:29.251 --> 00:41:33.181
<v Speaker 1>people on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the abortion was the most </v>

890
00:41:33.181 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious that sides have</v>

891
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.160
<v Speaker 2>a principled position to start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One doesn't want to control the woman's </v>

892
00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:39.950
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One doesn't want,</v>

893
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.490
<v Speaker 2>one wants to make sure that this child </v>
<v Speaker 2>is taken care of it and has the right to</v>

894
00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:48.491
<v Speaker 2>life and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like if we can at least </v>

895
00:41:48.491 --> 00:41:48.491
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge that now we can start </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing some of the science,</v>

896
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.620
<v Speaker 2>we can start discussing some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social responsibility of government and </v>

897
00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:53.620
<v Speaker 2>everything else</v>

898
00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.060
<v Speaker 1>before we get into trouble is when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>impugn the motives of another side </v>

899
00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.330
<v Speaker 1>because nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know our own motives half </v>

900
00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:00.330
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me to say,</v>

901
00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you just said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you what your moral failings</v>

902
00:42:02.081 --> 00:42:07.081
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you where you're not in </v>

903
00:42:07.081 --> 00:42:07.081
<v Speaker 1>command of your own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

904
00:42:07.081 --> 00:42:09.530
<v Speaker 1>moral nature to be flawed to make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument right.</v>

905
00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Anytime we get that from the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side's the reaction is obviously like a </v>

906
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.670
<v Speaker 1>highest men into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you said that I thought was the</v>

907
00:42:15.671 --> 00:42:17.920
<v Speaker 1>most courageous thing that you said and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the.</v>

908
00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

909
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:24.400
<v Speaker 1>the tectonic plate under which we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of build solutions.</v>

910
00:42:24.401 --> 00:42:25.000
<v Speaker 1>As you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

911
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I can seed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of my argument is arbitrary.</v>

912
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Like how about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you say?</v>

913
00:42:30.071 --> 00:42:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Twenty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 weeks,</v>

914
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.370
<v Speaker 1>so obviously weeks in a day.</v>

915
00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.410
<v Speaker 1>How about if she's raped and she's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to die,</v>

916
00:42:35.411 --> 00:42:38.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's 21 weeks there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

917
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.320
<v Speaker 1>We have to concede that we are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute in our views and some things </v>

918
00:42:43.361 --> 00:42:48.361
<v Speaker 1>are absolute for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like when we're talking about </v>

919
00:42:48.361 --> 00:42:48.361
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

920
00:42:48.361 --> 00:42:51.340
<v Speaker 1>When we're talking about gun discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's certain stuff where if</v>

921
00:42:51.341 --> 00:42:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you go in same thing where everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise your hand who's for gun control?</v>

922
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to immediately go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>their two camps,</v>

923
00:42:57.281 --> 00:42:58.990
<v Speaker 1>but you can go in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look guys,</v>

924
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:04.860
<v Speaker 1>politicians and the media always want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it seem like this is an all or </v>

925
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.770
<v Speaker 1>nothing proposition that anything that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slippery slope.</v>

926
00:43:05.771 --> 00:43:07.330
<v Speaker 1>We're going to just slide all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom,</v>

927
00:43:07.331 --> 00:43:09.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we make any impingement on,</v>

928
00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:15.210
<v Speaker 1>on second amendment rights that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's going to take our guns away </v>

929
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:15.210
<v Speaker 1>and the other side is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

930
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:18.250
<v Speaker 1>anything that you come for me for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I give any ground,</v>

931
00:43:18.251 --> 00:43:23.251
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's really entrenched in </v>

932
00:43:23.251 --> 00:43:23.420
<v Speaker 1>that and it's like we're already on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slippery.</v>

933
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.760
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think we need to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because it seems to me that I'm </v>

934
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.111
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got these two sides kind of going </v>

935
00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:33.111
<v Speaker 2>and polar opposite directions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

936
00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:37.431
<v Speaker 2>I've spent more time talking about one </v>
<v Speaker 2>side that I used to be part of because </v>

937
00:43:37.431 --> 00:43:37.431
<v Speaker 2>that's where I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I get it.</v>

938
00:43:37.431 --> 00:43:40.340
<v Speaker 2>We've got two sides doing this partially</v>
<v Speaker 2>scoring lover thing to do.</v>

939
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:41.070
<v Speaker 2>You do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

940
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.840
<v Speaker 2>that's why I said mugged left the year </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

941
00:43:42.841 --> 00:43:45.270
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm Bret Weinstein said that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

942
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I have ptsd basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever,</v>

943
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.750
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

944
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.110
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a part of something,</v>

945
00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.290
<v Speaker 2>you can recognize it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>

946
00:43:52.291 --> 00:43:57.291
<v Speaker 2>if 10 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm hanging out with all these </v>

947
00:43:57.291 --> 00:43:58.100
<v Speaker 2>libertarians and they're all crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

948
00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I'll call them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

949
00:43:59.371 --> 00:44:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Like I just think it's just human </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

950
00:44:01.081 --> 00:44:03.270
<v Speaker 2>You can go to what you know and where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were.</v>

951
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.690
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we need something crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>

952
00:44:06.691 --> 00:44:08.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what I mean by this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

953
00:44:08.581 --> 00:44:11.580
<v Speaker 2>To break this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about it rationally,</v>

954
00:44:11.581 --> 00:44:16.581
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the whole idw crew can talk about </v>

955
00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:16.581
<v Speaker 2>how to have these conversations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree to disagree and I,</v>

956
00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:17.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ben and the,</v>

957
00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Speaker 2>the gay cake and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can try to hopefully he'll make </v>

958
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.390
<v Speaker 2>me a cake one day now that I think he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in particularly good baker,</v>

959
00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.670
<v Speaker 2>but like we can do that for the next 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

960
00:44:26.671 --> 00:44:31.671
<v Speaker 2>that discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it almost seems to me we're on this </v>

961
00:44:31.671 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 2>like slide to something</v>

962
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.810
<v Speaker 1>really horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is gonna happen.</v>

963
00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what I mean,</v>

964
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:38.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's like what would it take to wake</v>
<v Speaker 1>people up to this?</v>

965
00:44:38.401 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 1>We're all talking about it and no one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually stopping it from happening.</v>

966
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inevitable descent I think in a </v>

967
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 1>weird way when everyone's looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of trump phenomenon,</v>

968
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:54.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which came out of nowhere seemingly but </v>

969
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:58.470
<v Speaker 1>really didn't part of the vote for him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for you know,</v>

970
00:44:58.471 --> 00:45:03.471
<v Speaker 1>a 70 something year old democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist from Vermont I think was that.</v>

971
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:08.541
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a reaction to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people said the status quo isn't </v>

972
00:45:08.541 --> 00:45:10.350
<v Speaker 1>going to work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

973
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be another Bush </v>

974
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

975
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.371
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might disagree with the choices that </v>

976
00:45:19.371 --> 00:45:22.191
<v Speaker 1>some people made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't disagree with the driving </v>

977
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.380
<v Speaker 1>anger and frustration that underlay </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

978
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:25.880
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

979
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Eric talks about the sort of three big </v>
<v Speaker 1>lies that have been put forth,</v>

980
00:45:30.271 --> 00:45:32.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is that all immigration is good,</v>

981
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is that would trade a rising </v>

982
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.731
<v Speaker 1>tide lifts all ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third is that there is zero </v>

983
00:45:40.731 --> 00:45:41.670
<v Speaker 1>connection whatsoever between terrorism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Islam,</v>

984
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.940
<v Speaker 1>that they're totally unhooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I add a fourth though,</v>

985
00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Eric thinks it's less relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it's the argument that,</v>

986
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that biology has no basis whatsoever in </v>

987
00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:53.730
<v Speaker 1>gender definition or in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

988
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>

989
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:56.070
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>

990
00:45:56.071 --> 00:45:57.830
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a huge one these days.</v>

991
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Mean Eric believes that that's less wide</v>
<v Speaker 1>spread.</v>

992
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:05.661
<v Speaker 1>But I think that culturally that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that position is so weaponizing that I </v>

993
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:10.530
<v Speaker 1>think that that's an equivalent one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what you're seeing is a</v>

994
00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:15.531
<v Speaker 1>reaction to these absolutes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows that a gut level aren't </v>

995
00:46:15.531 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 1>true and it's like everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining them on the surface.</v>

996
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's having a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

997
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:24.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe only an open borders or I </v>

998
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:24.800
<v Speaker 1>believe we have to shut down borders </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

999
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.150
<v Speaker 1>and separate families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>

1000
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:32.210
<v Speaker 1>these polls are so crazy and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're both groups are motivated </v>

1001
00:46:32.461 --> 00:46:37.461
<v Speaker 1>to protect their further left or right </v>
<v Speaker 1>compatriots.</v>

1002
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're having this movement that's </v>

1003
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.361
<v Speaker 1>going out in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's what it was a </v>

1004
00:46:44.361 --> 00:46:44.361
<v Speaker 1>reaction to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you're saying,</v>

1005
00:46:44.361 --> 00:46:45.150
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the point of the Big Bang theory</v>

1006
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:46.120
<v Speaker 1>that the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1007
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:51.290
<v Speaker 1>explodes that it starts to come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and because I'm afraid it's </v>

1008
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.450
<v Speaker 1>going to have to take something </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

1009
00:46:51.451 --> 00:46:52.530
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what I mean.</v>

1010
00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Is there going to be like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists deck or something that will </v>

1011
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.910
<v Speaker 1>just remind us that these people are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our enemies.</v>

1012
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:00.840
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1013
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to think of the world that </v>

1014
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.811
<v Speaker 1>you were saying essentially what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thesis is to say if there's a horrible </v>

1015
00:47:07.811 --> 00:47:11.370
<v Speaker 1>terrorist attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new sort of outgroup threat will get</v>

1016
00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Americans back together because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants that to happen of course.</v>

1017
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:20.481
<v Speaker 1>And there's huge danger and what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends up leading to because we know how </v>

1018
00:47:20.481 --> 00:47:22.170
<v Speaker 1>we sort of went crazy after nine slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>11 and the Patriot Act and all that.</v>

1019
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.650
<v Speaker 1>But like it just seems to me that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheels on this thing,</v>

1020
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.050
<v Speaker 1>although now people are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1021
00:47:28.051 --> 00:47:32.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not slowing down and that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads me to believe it gets to the ledge</v>

1022
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:35.400
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think the first thing is,</v>

1023
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:37.630
<v Speaker 1>is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like clean up your own kitchen first.</v>

1024
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the guy that I'm on tour with,</v>

1025
00:47:39.581 --> 00:47:40.930
<v Speaker 1>it's doing something about cleaning up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own.</v>

1026
00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.520
<v Speaker 1>But see I switched into kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>

1027
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was effective.</v>

1028
00:47:44.381 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It's yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan got everything.</v>

1029
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 1>He knows I'm boiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1030
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:53.881
<v Speaker 1>let's pause there for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just real quick because we shouldn't </v>

1031
00:47:53.881 --> 00:47:53.881
<v Speaker 1>have totally dismissed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were in Jordan student?</v>

1032
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:54.740
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1033
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 1>what was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1034
00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll get back there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just not because I wanted to </v>

1035
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:00.600
<v Speaker 1>do it like 20 minutes ago and Jordan was</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

1036
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Jordan from minute one.</v>

1037
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.530
<v Speaker 1>He taught me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1038
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:08.580
<v Speaker 1>personality psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back into the young seminar with </v>

1039
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.010
<v Speaker 1>him and then he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my thesis advisor is like,</v>

1040
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:09.850
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mid Nineties?</v>

1041
00:48:09.851 --> 00:48:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I graduated in 95 and he was dynamite.</v>

1042
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:16.540
<v Speaker 1>He was very imposing and formal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

1043
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:17.930
<v Speaker 1>right away was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1044
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:23.150
<v Speaker 1>was like I just got to solve the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and I remember telling my college </v>

1045
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.890
<v Speaker 1>roommates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1046
00:48:23.891 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a guy who's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered just by his last name,</v>

1047
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:30.080
<v Speaker 1>like Hundred Years after his dad and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1048
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I didn't quite think it was because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to be doing,</v>

1049
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kermit the frog.</v>

1050
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Hitler means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like whatever.</v>

1051
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just thought in an academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>arena.</v>

1052
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sort of brilliance for me was.</v>

1053
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:42.430
<v Speaker 1>And his pattern recognition and ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to boil stuff down.</v>

1054
00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.820
<v Speaker 1>But he would even then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody came in ideologically from </v>

1055
00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.050
<v Speaker 1>the left or the right and it was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hollow shell,</v>

1056
00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:53.020
<v Speaker 1>he would just puncture it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have as much of a,</v>

1057
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

1058
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:56.990
<v Speaker 1>He was formidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he wasn't as joking.</v>

1059
00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good friends now,</v>

1060
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.820
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1061
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.680
<v Speaker 1>he could be intimidating to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1062
00:49:02.681 --> 00:49:06.610
<v Speaker 1>but I always just really liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we stayed in touch after that.</v>

1063
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:11.611
<v Speaker 1>He was my thesis advisor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very close and then he officiated </v>

1064
00:49:11.611 --> 00:49:11.611
<v Speaker 1>my wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1065
00:49:11.611 --> 00:49:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only person on record to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wedding that like sites extensively from</v>

1066
00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Canaan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

1067
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:19.390
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume the Gulag archipelago needs.</v>

1068
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:23.110
<v Speaker 1>We had little like Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like table settings.</v>

1069
00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at one point my wife and I just re </v>

1070
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.760
<v Speaker 1>watched our wedding video was so funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's looking and you know,</v>

1071
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.260
<v Speaker 1>she adores Jordan to and Jordan was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going off about something and she,</v>

1072
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:38.490
<v Speaker 1>she's looking up at me and she's in her </v>
<v Speaker 1>dress like where that moment at the </v>

1073
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:38.490
<v Speaker 1>altar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

1074
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:42.031
<v Speaker 1>this is the part where I wasn't sure if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting married or being treated </v>

1075
00:49:42.031 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 1>like they're Jordan did a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypical analysis and then,</v>

1076
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:45.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1077
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I put his rules for life in orphan acts </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

1078
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.120
<v Speaker 1>as a I have like the assassins 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>commandments and I wanted to actually </v>

1079
00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.420
<v Speaker 1>good rules that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone could be raised by.</v>

1080
00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:56.890
<v Speaker 1>And then I helped him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1081
00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.090
<v Speaker 1>edit the book and work on the book from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the early stage.</v>

1082
00:50:01.091 --> 00:50:03.940
<v Speaker 1>So I read it and had an orphan x three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years before his book came out.</v>

1083
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:05.890
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say that when people would come</v>

1084
00:50:05.891 --> 00:50:08.680
<v Speaker 1>in with arguments from either side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he could just pop them just like that.</v>

1085
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:11.890
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to me because if you listen again</v>

1086
00:50:11.891 --> 00:50:14.440
<v Speaker 1>to what mainstream is saying about him </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he's this,</v>

1087
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:19.470
<v Speaker 1>he's this ultra conservative or this </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest monogamy or he doesn't like gay </v>

1088
00:50:19.901 --> 00:50:22.000
<v Speaker 1>people are just like any of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

1089
00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Which every night I hear him go up there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and beat these arguments down.</v>

1090
00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 1>He beats down the arguments of identity</v>

1091
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.360
<v Speaker 2>politics on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1092
00:50:29.361 --> 00:50:34.361
<v Speaker 2>he's literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every criticism of him is like the </v>

1093
00:50:34.361 --> 00:50:37.421
<v Speaker 2>reverse of what he's actually doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean he's right about </v>

1094
00:50:37.421 --> 00:50:37.421
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

1095
00:50:37.421 --> 00:50:38.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is deserving of criticism,</v>

1096
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:43.661
<v Speaker 2>but it should be legit criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it must infuriate you when you read </v>

1097
00:50:43.661 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 2>some of these things about him knowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1098
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1099
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:47.690
<v Speaker 2>this isn't the guy that you learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1100
00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you meanwhile he brings like a gay </v>

1101
00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.350
<v Speaker 1>guy on tour with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a crazy Christian homophone.</v>

1102
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1103
00:50:54.221 --> 00:50:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the jokes I have,</v>

1104
00:50:55.241 --> 00:50:58.890
<v Speaker 1>he got accused of being an antisemite at</v>
<v Speaker 1>some point and um,</v>

1105
00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:01.250
<v Speaker 1>it was so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric and I were talking about this and I</v>

1106
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:02.500
<v Speaker 1>think I tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1107
00:51:02.501 --> 00:51:03.460
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1108
00:51:03.461 --> 00:51:08.461
<v Speaker 1>Jordan did a terrible job covering up </v>
<v Speaker 1>his antisemitism when he officiated my </v>

1109
00:51:08.461 --> 00:51:12.451
<v Speaker 1>wedding 15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most incompetent anti-semite I've ever </v>

1110
00:51:12.451 --> 00:51:12.451
<v Speaker 1>met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1111
00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more infuriating for me.</v>

1112
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:19.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the media skew is so </v>

1113
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:20.310
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've almost given up on us in,</v>

1114
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:22.240
<v Speaker 1>in certain ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>

1115
00:51:22.241 --> 00:51:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I think the media has done an amazingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive stuff.</v>

1116
00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of the Washington Post </v>

1117
00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.060
<v Speaker 1>despite how some things have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like I'm not,</v>

1118
00:51:31.061 --> 00:51:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving up on that.</v>

1119
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the media is doing a </v>

1120
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:38.260
<v Speaker 1>really good job on cultural issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm accustomed to it when people come in</v>

1121
00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:42.070
<v Speaker 1>and attack Jordan for being right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there is a video online of him</v>

1122
00:51:42.071 --> 00:51:45.700
<v Speaker 1>denouncing the alt right for an hour if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you bothered to look into it.</v>

1123
00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:51.300
<v Speaker 1>The thing that infuriates me more </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly intelligent intellectual </v>

1124
00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:55.531
<v Speaker 1>people who will dismiss him or get </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous if I bring his name up based on </v>

1125
00:51:55.531 --> 00:51:58.900
<v Speaker 1>anything that is wildly taken out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

1126
00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.820
<v Speaker 1>And with Jordan it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1127
00:52:00.821 --> 00:52:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I was a student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known him a lot of years.</v>

1128
00:52:03.701 --> 00:52:08.701
<v Speaker 1>I've seen hundreds and hundreds of hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his lectures both in school and here.</v>

1129
00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:09.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1130
00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I helped him with his book when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going through the book and he makes fun </v>

1131
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:18.361
<v Speaker 1>of me for that and the acknowledgements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that he has said that I.</v>

1132
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know his work about as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone could.</v>

1133
00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:25.360
<v Speaker 1>There's not a single thing that he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you don't contextualize,</v>

1134
00:52:25.361 --> 00:52:28.900
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't actually make sense and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have people wholesale say,</v>

1135
00:52:28.901 --> 00:52:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I have my feelings about that.</v>

1136
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1137
00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll mentioned doing something with him </v>

1138
00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:37.020
<v Speaker 1>and people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are seemingly academic and I'll say,</v>

1139
00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:37.480
<v Speaker 1>did you read the book</v>

1140
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:42.970
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that just the plight of doing </v>

1141
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:42.970
<v Speaker 2>something that is something close to </v>
<v Speaker 2>true?</v>

1142
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I'm out there with him every</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and he changes the speed,</v>

1143
00:52:45.531 --> 00:52:46.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does an hour and a half.</v>

1144
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm warm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crowd up.</v>

1145
00:52:47.751 --> 00:52:50.420
<v Speaker 2>He does an hour and a half and then we </v>
<v Speaker 2>do like 40 minutes together at the end,</v>

1146
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:52.790
<v Speaker 2>but that hour and a half he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He changes it every night.</v>

1147
00:52:52.791 --> 00:52:56.900
<v Speaker 2>I see him searching for truth every </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and it's like,</v>

1148
00:52:57.110 --> 00:53:02.110
<v Speaker 2>well actually all this hatred and all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that non contextualized stuff that </v>

1149
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:06.101
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just the shitty part of doing </v>

1150
00:53:06.101 --> 00:53:06.620
<v Speaker 2>something good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1151
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that if you were writing the </v>

1152
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.511
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you be doing dealing with all </v>

1153
00:53:13.511 --> 00:53:13.511
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting.</v>

1154
00:53:13.511 --> 00:53:13.511
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1155
00:53:13.511 --> 00:53:16.490
<v Speaker 2>so two things like who's gonna say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something true and then it's going to be</v>

1156
00:53:16.491 --> 00:53:17.930
<v Speaker 2>all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's going to love him.</v>

1157
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worked out for Jesus.</v>

1158
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Didn't work out that well for the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the center right,</v>

1159
00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:29.160
<v Speaker 1>so I was thinking that brought up two </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of ideas for me.</v>

1160
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:34.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of them is people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly academic and intelligent and </v>

1161
00:53:34.161 --> 00:53:37.701
<v Speaker 1>pride themselves on being cerebral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how dare you denigrate him </v>

1162
00:53:37.701 --> 00:53:42.391
<v Speaker 1>because you read an unflattering profile</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not read a book or listen to a </v>

1163
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 1>lecture or do any research beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they got it in the New York Times.</v>

1164
00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1165
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:52.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean or in any host of other places </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have missed the mark and then the </v>

1166
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.200
<v Speaker 1>New York Times will come around and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something flattering.</v>

1167
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean a profiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a profile and they take a point of view </v>

1168
00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.110
<v Speaker 1>but like dig deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's so interesting is you were </v>

1169
00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:04.341
<v Speaker 1>just talking about that and that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a cool thing to watch him just like</v>

1170
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:09.411
<v Speaker 1>you're watching somebody grappling with </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues when he's on stage and you've </v>

1171
00:54:09.411 --> 00:54:09.411
<v Speaker 1>watched him do that a lot.</v>

1172
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.960
<v Speaker 1>It reminds me a bit of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abstract expressionists.</v>

1173
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:17.961
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're pollock started to say the act of </v>

1174
00:54:17.961 --> 00:54:18.660
<v Speaker 1>creation is a triumph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1175
00:54:18.661 --> 00:54:21.630
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm going to paint something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see my brush stroke,</v>

1176
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:26.631
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's laid on on canvas and of course </v>

1177
00:54:26.631 --> 00:54:29.631
<v Speaker 1>linkedin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did a great kind of piss take on </v>

1178
00:54:29.631 --> 00:54:30.000
<v Speaker 1>that where he did like a carefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>painted cartoon version of that.</v>

1179
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:35.390
<v Speaker 1>But where you really are seeing the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the work is what is the </v>

1180
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:39.161
<v Speaker 1>abstract expressionists really sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>put the art world on their head by </v>

1181
00:54:39.161 --> 00:54:42.720
<v Speaker 1>elevating the form and the function for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the heroism of the crater.</v>

1182
00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.580
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of interesting because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't,</v>

1183
00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've noted of course that he's grappling</v>

1184
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:49.410
<v Speaker 1>with things and part of him thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is what's appealing.</v>

1185
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Like the thing that I said that I keyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to with you is saying,</v>

1186
00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:56.661
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of my argument for pro choice is </v>

1187
00:54:56.661 --> 00:54:56.661
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>

1188
00:54:56.661 --> 00:54:56.670
<v Speaker 1>It has to be we're so used to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceding any of that,</v>

1189
00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:00.840
<v Speaker 1>so to see somebody stand up in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>3000 people and go hang on,</v>

1190
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:06.470
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really be reasoning with that in a </v>

1191
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:08.751
<v Speaker 1>way that you might reach in a bag and </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with nothing is compelling and </v>

1192
00:55:08.751 --> 00:55:12.351
<v Speaker 1>there's something heroic about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way the Jackson pollock was </v>

1193
00:55:12.351 --> 00:55:16.670
<v Speaker 1>portraying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as a writer you want to create </v>

1194
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:18.891
<v Speaker 1>characters that show vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it shows that they're human and </v>

1195
00:55:18.891 --> 00:55:22.491
<v Speaker 1>yet we seem to operate in a time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost no one is showing vulnerability </v>

1196
00:55:22.711 --> 00:55:25.170
<v Speaker 1>outwardly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our politicians don't want to show it or</v>

1197
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.310
<v Speaker 1>media people like everyone wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect every,</v>

1198
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:32.330
<v Speaker 1>all the virtue signaling these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants to be like this perfect </v>

1199
00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:34.320
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you get the few people that show</v>

1200
00:55:34.321 --> 00:55:37.230
<v Speaker 1>a little vulnerability and I guess that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a little extra value.</v>

1201
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

1202
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean we tend to question there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the point.</v>

1203
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I see.</v>

1204
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.550
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because we see a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo vulnerability,</v>

1205
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:50.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when it's masking virtue signaling,</v>

1206
00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:53.670
<v Speaker 1>like I've been thinking about this other</v>
<v Speaker 1>notion that I have,</v>

1207
00:55:53.671 --> 00:55:54.570
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1208
00:55:54.571 --> 00:55:56.310
<v Speaker 1>in writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's sort of like why am I doing</v>

1209
00:55:56.311 --> 00:55:57.690
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff and politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1210
00:55:57.691 --> 00:55:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing makes sense.</v>

1211
00:55:58.651 --> 00:56:00.210
<v Speaker 1>So I looked back on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was like,</v>

1212
00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:01.200
<v Speaker 1>why would I study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1213
00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:02.910
<v Speaker 1>shakespearian tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young and Freud,</v>

1214
00:56:02.911 --> 00:56:03.780
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1215
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:05.430
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's thrillers,</v>

1216
00:56:05.431 --> 00:56:06.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's everything that I love.</v>

1217
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.330
<v Speaker 1>But likewise with politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you're writing,</v>

1218
00:56:09.331 --> 00:56:11.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to avoid is cliche.</v>

1219
00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you don't want to do is do </v>

1220
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.030
<v Speaker 1>like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're supposed to say,</v>

1221
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:21.651
<v Speaker 1>everything about you and what you do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not saying what everyone else says and </v>

1222
00:56:21.651 --> 00:56:23.010
<v Speaker 1>not lowering yourself to cliche.</v>

1223
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:23.820
<v Speaker 1>So in books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1224
00:56:23.821 --> 00:56:25.450
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you search for,</v>

1225
00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:27.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's an obvious plot turn right,</v>

1226
00:56:27.281 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you have the cops sitting outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy being like,</v>

1227
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 1>this is my last day till retirement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy a yacht and sail around</v>

1228
00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:33.430
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1229
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:38.431
<v Speaker 1>that guy's getting killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything we try and do is avoid </v>

1230
00:56:38.431 --> 00:56:38.431
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1231
00:56:38.431 --> 00:56:42.240
<v Speaker 1>So in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much of what I'm doing is trying to </v>

1232
00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.791
<v Speaker 1>make people speak humanly and to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>buzzwords and so it's like I have this </v>

1233
00:56:44.831 --> 00:56:47.050
<v Speaker 1>theory that like as soon as you talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1234
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:52.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman's right to choose that doesn't </v>

1235
00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:54.160
<v Speaker 1>feel like it's sufficiently complex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated.</v>

1236
00:56:54.161 --> 00:56:57.610
<v Speaker 1>I understand people need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to gravitate with shorthand.</v>

1237
00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:00.880
<v Speaker 1>But like I remember growing up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan era family of like,</v>

1238
00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:05.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were the only Jews in Saratoga and </v>

1239
00:57:05.881 --> 00:57:08.971
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley in my neighborhood at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and the only people who voted </v>

1240
00:57:08.971 --> 00:57:08.971
<v Speaker 1>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1241
00:57:08.971 --> 00:57:11.380
<v Speaker 1>it was early days of Silicon Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so diverse now,</v>

1242
00:57:11.381 --> 00:57:16.381
<v Speaker 1>but that was all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Hewlett Packard engineers who look </v>

1243
00:57:16.381 --> 00:57:17.320
<v Speaker 1>like the launch guys from NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the glasses and the pocket protector.</v>

1244
00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:19.290
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was totally geared that way.</v>

1245
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Retail is not thrilled with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity in silicon valley,</v>

1246
00:57:21.311 --> 00:57:22.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's a different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot Okay.</v>

1247
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1248
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 1>he's not thrilled with the diversity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

1249
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:27.940
<v Speaker 1>but you were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university is getting code of thought.</v>

1250
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Where was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost my thread.</v>

1251
00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 1>You guys were the outliers when you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up there.</v>

1252
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everybody was talking about </v>

1253
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.741
<v Speaker 1>family values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big political thing from the </v>

1254
00:57:40.741 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 1>rice and I'm sure you had a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to that too,</v>

1255
00:57:41.021 --> 00:57:46.021
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I want to talk about family values </v>

1256
00:57:46.021 --> 00:57:48.570
<v Speaker 1>and I just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you feel like it's such a </v>

1257
00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Republican word that coded for all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff for me?</v>

1258
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:50.350
<v Speaker 1>And I was naturally very resistant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1259
00:57:50.351 --> 00:57:51.490
<v Speaker 1>So then I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get married,</v>

1260
00:57:51.491 --> 00:57:52.900
<v Speaker 1>I have two kids and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1261
00:57:52.901 --> 00:57:53.500
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1262
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I should have family values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family values.</v>

1263
00:57:55.630 --> 00:58:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I like this new light because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word was co-opted as a catchphrase and </v>

1264
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:05.011
<v Speaker 1>when Republicans were using it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it one time it had a rich and body</v>

1265
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:11.430
<v Speaker 1>of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it's used again and again and </v>

1266
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:12.010
<v Speaker 1>again and again in a campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it loses all the life to it.</v>

1267
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing happens with liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>slogans.</v>

1268
00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And so it's almost like the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>compressing information into newsworthy </v>

1269
00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:24.720
<v Speaker 1>soundbites and using phrases and catch </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases the further you are from genuine</v>

1270
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:30.510
<v Speaker 1>or authentic thought and it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar thing of where you're trying to </v>

1271
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:33.910
<v Speaker 1>reach in and do things differently in </v>
<v Speaker 1>novels or in screenwriting or Comex,</v>

1272
00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very similar thing to the stage.</v>

1273
00:58:36.491 --> 00:58:41.491
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't just shovel out a bunch of </v>

1274
00:58:41.491 --> 00:58:41.491
<v Speaker 1>cliches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1275
00:58:41.491 --> 00:58:44.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats are all for redistribution of </v>

1276
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:44.520
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1277
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:44.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what all democrats are for.</v>

1278
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Republicans are all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1279
00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.770
<v Speaker 1>racist and scared of outsiders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1280
00:58:47.771 --> 00:58:49.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what all Republicans are.</v>

1281
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:53.410
<v Speaker 1>And so the more that we hear things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've heard again and again and again,</v>

1282
00:58:53.411 --> 00:58:58.411
<v Speaker 1>the further we're off the mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's why this expansive </v>

1283
00:58:58.411 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 1>format you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1284
00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 1>is what's leading to more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>things because we're not,</v>

1285
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:06.250
<v Speaker 1>we don't have two minutes to just sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hurl the cliches at each other.</v>

1286
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:10.540
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're looking forward a little bit to</v>

1287
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:13.420
<v Speaker 1>the elections that are about to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these midterms now,</v>

1288
00:59:13.421 --> 00:59:16.090
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the decent Democrats,</v>

1289
00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:21.120
<v Speaker 1>trying to retain some of what old </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism and old democratic messaging </v>

1290
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.900
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a really tough position here </v>

1291
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 1>because it seems to me that if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats win,</v>

1292
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.600
<v Speaker 1>it means that the further left wing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the party wins right now.</v>

1293
00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a fair estimation?</v>

1294
00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's right.</v>

1295
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:35.870
<v Speaker 1>So because you think that these sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown people.</v>

1296
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

1297
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like tell me the candidates who </v>

1298
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:43.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be hardcore laugh.</v>

1299
00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Well here's the reason I'm asking you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if,</v>

1300
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 1>if the argument is that these far left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are going to win.</v>

1301
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Well then there's no reason to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reformation of the Democratic Party.</v>

1302
00:59:51.951 --> 00:59:52.760
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1303
00:59:52.761 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Greg Sia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1304
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:54.920
<v Speaker 1>our far left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one.</v>

1305
00:59:55.430 --> 01:00:00.430
<v Speaker 1>If the Republicans win and then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of far left thing implodes,</v>

1306
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.320
<v Speaker 1>then there's a huge amount of space for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1307
01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if what you're saying is there is this </v>

1308
01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:11.531
<v Speaker 1>huge groundswell of people that nobody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard of who are more moderate sort of </v>

1309
01:00:11.531 --> 01:00:13.400
<v Speaker 1>blue dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're rejecting some of this socialism</v>

1310
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:18.401
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hopeful story there that I </v>

1311
01:00:18.401 --> 01:00:18.401
<v Speaker 1>haven't heard too much.</v>

1312
01:00:18.401 --> 01:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm more sanguine about this </v>

1313
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:23.771
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like just like we talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about people dismissing Jordan because </v>

1314
01:00:23.771 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>they read a New York Times profile or </v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever the head pieces of the guy</v>

1315
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:28.610
<v Speaker 1>who talked about him romancing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>salvage,</v>

1316
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.650
<v Speaker 1>like there's horrible stuff that's out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1317
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:36.250
<v Speaker 1>but they haven't actually read his book </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they haven't seen an actual lecture </v>

1318
01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>or they haven't read an opposing piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you only want to read profiles,</v>

1319
01:00:38.271 --> 01:00:43.271
<v Speaker 1>so it's like maybe read a flattering one</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hold yourself to be an </v>

1320
01:00:43.271 --> 01:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>intellectual before dismissing him as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pseudo scientists,</v>

1321
01:00:44.631 --> 01:00:46.970
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given his academic record,</v>

1322
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>like maybe take a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bigger position.</v>

1323
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Same thing is happening in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>with politics and like,</v>

1324
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever want to put people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot,</v>

1325
01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:55.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1326
01:00:55.401 --> 01:01:00.401
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like name a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>congressional candidates and people are </v>

1327
01:01:00.401 --> 01:01:03.851
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Rossio and across you it's like </v>

1328
01:01:03.851 --> 01:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what we're reading.</v>

1329
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.760
<v Speaker 1>That's not the water we're swimming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to really have a conversation we </v>

1330
01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.630
<v Speaker 1>have to go outside of the profiles </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1331
01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you being an old writer and Jordan being</v>

1332
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever Jordan is this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1333
01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>The things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

1334
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know we need to go out and dig into </v>

1335
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:25.061
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing where I can say </v>

1336
01:01:25.061 --> 01:01:25.061
<v Speaker 1>I've spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1337
01:01:25.061 --> 01:01:28.210
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of hours with the party and </v>

1338
01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:28.210
<v Speaker 1>finding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know all this stuff,</v>

1339
01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:31.430
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not a natural politician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to talk to people to go,</v>

1340
01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>here's what I think we need to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unify the party,</v>

1341
01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the values that I think that we've</v>

1342
01:01:37.821 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>had in the past and need to improve on </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

1343
01:01:40.881 --> 01:01:45.881
<v Speaker 1>Especially with the anticorruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the way that we need to talk </v>

1344
01:01:45.881 --> 01:01:49.301
<v Speaker 1>about issues that they can see that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side is human and that we don't </v>

1345
01:01:49.301 --> 01:01:52.370
<v Speaker 1>have a magical ball to judge them and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>judge all of their moral shortcomings.</v>

1346
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm finding again and again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>again and again,</v>

1347
01:01:56.751 --> 01:02:01.130
<v Speaker 1>is that these candidates are amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's sort of no reason unless you</v>

1348
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:06.131
<v Speaker 1>really go digging that you would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard of them because no one's doing </v>

1349
01:02:06.131 --> 01:02:06.131
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of why I,</v>

1350
01:02:06.131 --> 01:02:10.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called you to enlist you in my eval </v>

1351
01:02:10.751 --> 01:02:10.751
<v Speaker 1>project and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1352
01:02:10.751 --> 01:02:14.680
<v Speaker 1>you and I agree on almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me get some people on here to talk </v>

1353
01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:19.121
<v Speaker 1>to you so that you can see that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in fact like 90 percent of the </v>

1354
01:02:19.121 --> 01:02:19.121
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1355
01:02:19.121 --> 01:02:23.261
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care how this story ends as long as I </v>

1356
01:02:23.261 --> 01:02:23.261
<v Speaker 1>remain true to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

1357
01:02:23.261 --> 01:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>if you succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1358
01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:28.761
<v Speaker 1>And the messaging of this succeeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and five years from now I'm proud to be </v>

1359
01:02:28.761 --> 01:02:32.481
<v Speaker 1>a Democrat again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that even matters in the labeling </v>

1360
01:02:32.481 --> 01:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>process or whether I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever else I am,</v>

1361
01:02:33.001 --> 01:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>as long as I'm true to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I care about,</v>

1362
01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:39.921
<v Speaker 1>but like it's like man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to it and make this thing work and </v>

1363
01:02:39.921 --> 01:02:39.921
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be great.</v>

1364
01:02:39.921 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I should also make,</v>

1365
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.040
<v Speaker 1>make abundantly clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't mean in any way to imply </v>

1366
01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>that I'm somehow like the magical </v>
<v Speaker 1>steering.</v>

1367
01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1368
01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1369
01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:48.990
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1370
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>But I mean that's what I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm doing my part of that.</v>

1371
01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>But obviously there's a lot of political</v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>

1372
01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My team is,</v>

1373
01:02:56.770 --> 01:03:01.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>includes Marshall Herskovitz and Kenny </v>

1374
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Corey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we have a lot of people who are </v>

1375
01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>engaged in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1376
01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1377
01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.310
<v Speaker 1>your point holds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just realized I don't,</v>

1378
01:03:05.311 --> 01:03:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sit here and pretend </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm,</v>

1379
01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm the unique message or the party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had been putting in a lot of time </v>

1380
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:13.080
<v Speaker 1>and I think I see things in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1381
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I have a pretty broad range of friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>and associates and I think I can really </v>

1382
01:03:19.561 --> 01:03:21.450
<v Speaker 1>see things well from different </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives.</v>

1383
01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Like if there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is,</v>

1384
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another talent that I would claim </v>

1385
01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>besides typing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1386
01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:28.920
<v Speaker 1>it might be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like I'm,</v>

1387
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad and empowered to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations with people like you where</v>

1388
01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you have concerns that are </v>

1389
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:38.700
<v Speaker 1>different than mine and a real genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity to kind of go,</v>

1390
01:03:38.701 --> 01:03:41.730
<v Speaker 1>what are poke called poke holes in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I'm thinking.</v>

1391
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Tell me everything that's dumped because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll give me a big benefit when I </v>

1392
01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.031
<v Speaker 1>have to go sell it internally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly when we go out in the real </v>

1393
01:03:50.031 --> 01:03:52.641
<v Speaker 1>world because then you're naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I can enlist people who think </v>

1394
01:03:52.641 --> 01:03:54.690
<v Speaker 1>differently and see the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently to really beat up ideas that</v>

1395
01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:57.210
<v Speaker 1>I might have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's just silly.</v>

1396
01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.730
<v Speaker 1>That's like wandering out into the mob </v>
<v Speaker 1>naked,</v>

1397
01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:01.040
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

1398
01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:06.041
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just something that's always </v>

1399
01:04:06.041 --> 01:04:06.041
<v Speaker 1>intrigued me.</v>

1400
01:04:06.041 --> 01:04:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty solid input.</v>

1401
01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think unless you got something better </v>

1402
01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:11.490
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was that.</v>

1403
01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:11.850
<v Speaker 1>We kind of wrapped it nicely there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1404
01:04:11.851 --> 01:04:16.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I deteriorate into </v>

1405
01:04:16.851 --> 01:04:16.851
<v Speaker 1>inarticulateness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll just.</v>

1406
01:04:16.851 --> 01:04:16.851
<v Speaker 1>We'll call it a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1407
01:04:16.851 --> 01:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do more on comic books </v>
<v Speaker 1>next time I think we should do all comic</v>

1408
01:04:18.701 --> 01:04:23.701
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should just totally geek out and </v>

1409
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:24.630
<v Speaker 1>you'll have like three viewers like your</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast low will get super.</v>

1410
01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you'll get a whole bunch of </v>

1411
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.690
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1412
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.690
<v Speaker 1>You just shift audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1413
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It's all the people who we associate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with are not going to be interested </v>

1414
01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:33.980
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

1415
01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:34.110
<v Speaker 1>It's been a pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
