1
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be sitting down with Tommy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Robinson this week to say,</v>

2
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a controversial figure,</v>

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.004
<v Speaker 1>would be putting it mildly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only have to glance it is twitter </v>

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:10.854
<v Speaker 1>mentions to see how some see him as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern day hero defending Western </v>

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>society while others see him as a racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>thug.</v>

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.773
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully I don't get all my </v>
<v Speaker 1>information from twitter and neither </v>

7
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:21.804
<v Speaker 1>should you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy is the cofounder of the English </v>

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Defense League,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movement that opposes Islam,</v>

9
00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:27.454
<v Speaker 1>Islam and Sharia law in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left the edl a few years ago after </v>

10
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:31.914
<v Speaker 1>connecting with my [inaudible] is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quilliam Foundation because he felt the </v>

11
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>edl had become too extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

12
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:38.454
<v Speaker 1>Tommy is part of Paquita UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a subset of the bigger European paquita </v>

13
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.314
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has the stated goal of preventing </v>

14
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>the Islamification of our countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

15
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:50.094
<v Speaker 1>Tommy thinks that the UK and now all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe are in route to becoming Islamic </v>

16
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:55.270
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time.</v>

17
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.263
<v Speaker 1>He reached out to me about two months </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago to see about being a guest on the </v>

18
00:00:58.621 --> 00:00:59.454
<v Speaker 1>show before I said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually had to do a bit of soul </v>

19
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>searching.</v>

20
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.203
<v Speaker 1>As you guys know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm beyond fed up with the regressive </v>

21
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>left's labeling of everyone a bigot or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

22
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.443
<v Speaker 1>but in Tommy's case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they actually right and if the </v>

23
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:12.924
<v Speaker 1>regressives are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should I even talk to someone with </v>

24
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>racist views?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt.</v>

25
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Tommy spends most of his time talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the dangers of Islam.</v>

26
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:21.474
<v Speaker 1>He certainly isn't hiding that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are his motives actually based in </v>

27
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:25.224
<v Speaker 1>bigotry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just those questions that had </v>

28
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:28.374
<v Speaker 1>me unsure whether to talk to him though </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was actually something else at </v>

29
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>work and something that really exposes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rot that the regressives are causing</v>

30
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of me was actually afraid that if I</v>

31
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:40.284
<v Speaker 1>spoke to Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of whether he really is a </v>

32
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>bigot or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I also would be labeled a bigot.</v>

33
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.943
<v Speaker 1>Let me repeat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feared that just by having a </v>

34
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>conversation with someone just by </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing their views on this show as I do</v>

35
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>every week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would then get one of those awful</v>

36
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>labels that people throw around thrown </v>
<v Speaker 1>on me.</v>

37
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>After a couple of days of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

38
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I realized that not only did I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the interview with Tommy,</v>

39
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>but my fear was the exact reason that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to do it.</v>

40
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.173
<v Speaker 1>The chilling effect that words like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigoted and racist have are not just on </v>

41
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:13.254
<v Speaker 1>the person and who they are aimed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also used to stop other </v>

42
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>people from talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The less we talk,</v>

43
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>the more the authoritarians can move in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with easy answers.</v>

44
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Once I really wrapped myself around </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

45
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:25.644
<v Speaker 1>it was a no brainer like all my guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all at Tommy's ideas be heard and you </v>

46
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>the audience will be the judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>

47
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>if the left had been more honest about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dangers of Islam,</v>

48
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.204
<v Speaker 1>Islam all along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would feel less of a need to have </v>

49
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>conversations like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they refuse to.</v>

50
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>So here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If his ideas are good,</v>

51
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>then let them spread.</v>

52
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>If they aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then let them be beat by better ideas.</v>

53
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.133
<v Speaker 1>As my former guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Murray said on Sam Harris' </v>

54
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.833
<v Speaker 1>podcast a few weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too late to be willing to be </v>

55
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:55.344
<v Speaker 1>blackmailed by people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally insincere in their </v>

56
00:02:58.051 --> 00:02:58.884
<v Speaker 1>insults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly how I feel about labels </v>

57
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:02.164
<v Speaker 1>or pretty much any of the other nonsense</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from people who would rather </v>

58
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.280
<v Speaker 1>stifled debate than have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This past weekend.</v>

59
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I rewatched one of my all time favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

60
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>v for Vendetta and powerful speech to </v>
<v Speaker 1>London.</v>

61
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:14.014
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where once you had the freedom to </v>

62
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>object to think and speak as you saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>fit,</v>

63
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.923
<v Speaker 1>you now have sensors and systems of </v>
<v Speaker 1>surveillance coercing you're conformity </v>

64
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and soliciting your submission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did this happen?</v>

65
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Who's to blame?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>certainly there are those more </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible than others and they will be</v>

67
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>held accountable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

68
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>truth be told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking for the guilty,</v>

69
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.573
<v Speaker 1>you need only look in the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's getting high time that we </v>

70
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>all look in the mirror and decide what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we believe.</v>

71
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.790
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is an author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>activist,</v>

72
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:47.624
<v Speaker 1>and former leader of the English defense</v>
<v Speaker 1>league is also no stranger to </v>

73
00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 1>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Robinson,</v>

74
00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:53.414
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the show.</v>

75
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.893
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

76
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>All right man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to start with this,</v>

77
00:03:57.911 --> 00:03:58.744
<v Speaker 1>which is what I lead the show off with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that I struggled with the </v>

78
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:03.394
<v Speaker 1>decision to even have you on the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I see what people say about you </v>

79
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.303
<v Speaker 1>and half of it is this guy is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save the Western world and then half of </v>

80
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>it is he's a bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a racist and plenty other stuff,</v>

81
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in line with that.</v>

82
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you get that often?</v>

83
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you get that people are sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to talk to you?</v>

84
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

85
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.683
<v Speaker 2>And there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will be targeted as high as anyone </v>

86
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 2>else that speaks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Great.</v>

87
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.790
<v Speaker 2>By a campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will trust me.</v>

88
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:39.624
<v Speaker 2>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just been asked last night it was </v>

89
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:44.280
<v Speaker 2>released on ongoing to be addressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

90
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.380
<v Speaker 2>the Hindu leadership of the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been invited to an event to discuss</v>

91
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.160
<v Speaker 2>multiculturalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been targeted,</v>

92
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.550
<v Speaker 2>they're getting attacked now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I expect that when I turn up,</v>

93
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.670
<v Speaker 2>if they're not forced or pressurized </v>
<v Speaker 2>into canceling,</v>

94
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.420
<v Speaker 2>which is what's happened with university</v>
<v Speaker 2>after university,</v>

95
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.230
<v Speaker 2>after university with schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone that asked me to speak,</v>

96
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.450
<v Speaker 2>even tv shows in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a conservative effort to silence</v>

97
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:16.680
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying and to attack anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gives me a platform to say it.</v>

98
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:18.174
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned that the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was really what my deciding factor </v>

100
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:21.684
<v Speaker 1>was to talk to you because I'm so sick </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everyone being labeled bigoted and </v>

101
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:27.264
<v Speaker 1>racist and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if I'm afraid to talk to you then </v>

102
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:33.390
<v Speaker 1>that that is almost a bigger problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>than bigotry and racism,</v>

103
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.150
<v Speaker 1>so that's why we have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

104
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

105
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.870
<v Speaker 2>you're in a minority that I so thank </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

106
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.603
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

107
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.143
<v Speaker 2>most people put their reputations or </v>
<v Speaker 2>their careers or what things are that </v>

108
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 2>before free speech in the UK.</v>

109
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

110
00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:50.984
<v Speaker 1>somehow I still have this belief that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about free speech that it'll </v>

111
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.110
<v Speaker 1>actually be good for my career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shall,</v>

112
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we start with this?</v>

113
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's just start with the most obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of meat.</v>

114
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Are you bigoted against Muslims?</v>

115
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Go to separate Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I,</v>

116
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.273
<v Speaker 2>whenever I speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to set up separate Muslims from </v>

117
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:12.884
<v Speaker 2>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an opinion on Islam in the same </v>

118
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:19.390
<v Speaker 2>way Islam has an opinion on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam is bigoted towards Muslims.</v>

119
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not every Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

120
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:22.840
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every Muslim is not bigoted.</v>

121
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

122
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.483
<v Speaker 2>if you've read my book that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best meet people I've met in my life </v>

123
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:31.830
<v Speaker 2>growing up on Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with Muslim,</v>

124
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 2>but I do have a problem with the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam is influencing my country.</v>

125
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I have a problem with the hatred that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>incited from it.</v>

126
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.703
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're fearful of what the future </v>

127
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:41.560
<v Speaker 2>holds.</v>

128
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to be clear,</v>

129
00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:45.400
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I've spent a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time on the show talking about.</v>

130
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.760
<v Speaker 1>You're making a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

131
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.260
<v Speaker 1>meaning the doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the set of ideas that are in books,</v>

132
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.413
<v Speaker 1>a between that and between the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that may or may not be using these </v>

133
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.790
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you said,</v>

134
00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:01.624
<v Speaker 1>you've met plenty of Muslim people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you liked a lot and you're making that </v>

135
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>

136
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll make that distinction in a similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to the fact that,</v>

137
00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:09.120
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was a critic of Scientology,</v>

138
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.020
<v Speaker 2>I would not be getting called a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not be getting called any of the</v>

139
00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:13.854
<v Speaker 2>things that I am just because it happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the majority of Muslims are not </v>

140
00:07:17.941 --> 00:07:18.774
<v Speaker 2>white on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beaten down and attacked with this </v>

141
00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:21.624
<v Speaker 2>racist stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is ridiculous because Islam is an </v>

142
00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:24.744
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an idea that should be criticize </v>

143
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.300
<v Speaker 2>and it's my God given right to criticize</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

144
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't incite hate against any </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual Muslims.</v>

145
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:33.803
<v Speaker 2>I've never ever there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let the English Defense League for </v>

146
00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:37.660
<v Speaker 2>over six years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

147
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I've never been done for any racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any extremism,</v>

148
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.280
<v Speaker 2>any insightful speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

149
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:48.270
<v Speaker 2>if people at the height of leading the </v>
<v Speaker 2>English Defense League when there was,</v>

150
00:07:48.271 --> 00:07:49.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when our soldier leaving,</v>

151
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.670
<v Speaker 2>he was beheaded in the streets of London</v>
<v Speaker 2>are very next demonstration.</v>

152
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.893
<v Speaker 2>I started my speech off by saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are 600 Muslims who served in the </v>

153
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.673
<v Speaker 2>British armed forces that if you attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Muslim woman or you get spare Muslim </v>

154
00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:03.240
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

155
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.073
<v Speaker 2>You're an absolute coward and I tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the distinction between some things </v>

156
00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:08.094
<v Speaker 2>are morally just and I think my campaign</v>
<v Speaker 2>is morally just and righteous and other </v>

157
00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:14.610
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cowardly attack in houses of worship,</v>

158
00:08:14.611 --> 00:08:17.160
<v Speaker 2>whether they be Christian or Muslim is </v>
<v Speaker 2>cowardly.</v>

159
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.340
<v Speaker 2>So from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that from day one.</v>

160
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.180
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as the organization goes,</v>

161
00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:25.770
<v Speaker 2>we've been a moderate voice in this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

162
00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:26.604
<v Speaker 2>but we can put completely attacked as </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremists or hateful and insight and </v>

163
00:08:29.761 --> 00:08:32.890
<v Speaker 2>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally just this week I've gone where</v>

164
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.160
<v Speaker 2>we're having a demonstration in the city</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Birmingham,</v>

165
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.170
<v Speaker 2>which is Britain's second biggest city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has it,</v>

166
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.590
<v Speaker 2>has a large Muslim population that has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of problems there.</v>

167
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.300
<v Speaker 2>And I met a Muslim counselor and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

168
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.690
<v Speaker 2>This is where the problem comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said to him,</v>

169
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:50.070
<v Speaker 2>if an organization is completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful and there's no violence,</v>

170
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.993
<v Speaker 2>there's no alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have a right to come to this </v>

171
00:08:53.191 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 2>city?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And criticized as well,</v>

172
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 2>and he said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where we're at.</v>

173
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.231
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

174
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because criticizing Islam insights.</v>

175
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

176
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 2>telling the truth can't incite hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

177
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 2>and that's where we've been beaten down </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much because so many.</v>

178
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a counselor for the Labor Party,</v>

179
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.253
<v Speaker 2>which is a mainstream political party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people are against free speech </v>

180
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to Islam.</v>

181
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well as my audience knows,</v>

182
00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is really where the left has</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed.</v>

183
00:09:21.441 --> 00:09:22.274
<v Speaker 1>And from everything that I'm hearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>from my friends in the UK and across </v>

184
00:09:24.441 --> 00:09:27.020
<v Speaker 1>most of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sadly most of western Europe,</v>

185
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.620
<v Speaker 1>the left is failing everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

186
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.840
<v Speaker 1>and the more that the voices of Liberals</v>
<v Speaker 1>are silenced,</v>

187
00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:35.780
<v Speaker 1>the more that the far right is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be strengthened.</v>

188
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:36.893
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably somewhat of an example </v>

189
00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:38.774
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before we get into all the specifics </v>

190
00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:41.264
<v Speaker 1>and everything that's going on today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you just tell me a little bit of </v>

191
00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:47.030
<v Speaker 1>your history growing up when you became </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically active?</v>

192
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.163
<v Speaker 1>That kind of stuff.</v>

193
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.670
<v Speaker 2>So I grew up in a town called Luton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

194
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.910
<v Speaker 2>so one of the most multicultural towns </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Europe when I was born in 1982,</v>

195
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 2>there was one mosque.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's an excess of 30.</v>

196
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.870
<v Speaker 2>We have approximately 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims.</v>

197
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 2>We've had just last week for Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>from my hometown.</v>

198
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:10.130
<v Speaker 2>One which went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to my school,</v>

199
00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:12.810
<v Speaker 2>had been charged with terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another young,</v>

200
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.260
<v Speaker 2>another Muslim who was a white convert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just again this,</v>

201
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.400
<v Speaker 2>this week has been charged with insight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and support for Isis.</v>

202
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 2>My hometown was the launch pad for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven seven attack on London.</v>

203
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.930
<v Speaker 2>London's underground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fertilizer bomb plot.</v>

204
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stock counting bomber.</v>

205
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Some of you may remember the stock </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomber.</v>

206
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.970
<v Speaker 2>He was radicalized in my hometown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lived two doors away from my army.</v>

207
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.580
<v Speaker 2>So Amazon Redeem Omar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Omar Bakri Abu Hamza with the hook,</v>

208
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 2>their head office and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations base was in my town.</v>

209
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.340
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in their town?</v>

210
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.030
<v Speaker 2>What's going on in that sound is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

211
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.820
<v Speaker 2>we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been the epicenter and the,</v>

212
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:53.703
<v Speaker 2>and the home of radical Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there'd been allowed with </v>

213
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.950
<v Speaker 2>unchallenged by councils or government </v>
<v Speaker 2>or police for 30 years to plan,</v>

214
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 2>orchestrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and radicalize an entire community.</v>

215
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:05.843
<v Speaker 2>And we've filled in my hometown after </v>
<v Speaker 2>September the 11th in America when I </v>

216
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:11.034
<v Speaker 2>come out to my shops the next week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had magnificent noname posters </v>

217
00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had posters glorifying the 19 suicide</v>

218
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:19.840
<v Speaker 2>bombers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

219
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.910
<v Speaker 2>the in the local college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They celebrate it every year after that,</v>

220
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.953
<v Speaker 2>outside in our town center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a celebration parade for the </v>

221
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Muslims who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

222
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 2>who murdered on September 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I live.</v>

223
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.440
<v Speaker 2>So I've grown up from a very young age </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have,</v>

224
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I have many of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we call liberals in the UK,</v>

225
00:11:36.691 --> 00:11:41.010
<v Speaker 2>they're not really liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but or those on the left who condemn me,</v>

226
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.990
<v Speaker 2>they shout at me that they.</v>

227
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.120
<v Speaker 2>And they know nothing about the life </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lived.</v>

228
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

229
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 2>to the life I've lived that have not </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen what we've seen.</v>

230
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.343
<v Speaker 2>They don't live with the effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we talk about multiculturalism </v>

231
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 2>in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have our political leaders.</v>

232
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 2>David Cameron has come out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiculturalism has failed.</v>

233
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Angela Merkel said years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiculturalism has failed.</v>

234
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 2>What they're actually saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're actually saying.</v>

235
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 2>This Islams failed because in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hometown and my group of friends,</v>

236
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 2>the majority of them come from immigrant</v>
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds,</v>

237
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:14.920
<v Speaker 2>whether it be Saint Lucian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian,</v>

238
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Bulgarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamaican,</v>

239
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone gets on fine.</v>

240
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my town has been divided,</v>

241
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 2>not through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not through racial lines ever.</v>

242
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.550
<v Speaker 2>We don't have the racial problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you believe you may have</v>

243
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:28.384
<v Speaker 2>in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have a racial problem that </v>

244
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.993
<v Speaker 2>we have a religious tensions and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious line drawn through the </v>

245
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:34.654
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>

246
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you saw this growing up,</v>

247
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.000
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not that old,</v>

249
00:12:41.001 --> 00:12:42.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in your mid thirties.</v>

250
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.040
<v Speaker 1>When did your sort of awakening a </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear?</v>

251
00:12:46.041 --> 00:12:46.910
<v Speaker 1>When did you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

252
00:12:46.911 --> 00:12:50.000
<v Speaker 1>this is something that I'd have to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and attach myself to?</v>

253
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.290
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

254
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.620
<v Speaker 2>my awakening was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

255
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.560
<v Speaker 2>the Beslan school massacre 2000 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>2004,</v>

256
00:12:57.561 --> 00:12:58.394
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it was was that I'd watch this </v>

257
00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:01.880
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this group,</v>

258
00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:02.714
<v Speaker 2>how measure dean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd watch them grow and and when I say </v>

259
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.383
<v Speaker 2>watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the man who's convicted this </v>

260
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.473
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was an ex member of their </v>

261
00:13:08.751 --> 00:13:09.584
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a white ginger convert would ebe room </v>

262
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Hansen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name is Roger.</v>

263
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched him convert.</v>

264
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.943
<v Speaker 2>I'd watched him become radical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd seen some of my own friends who had </v>

265
00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:22.604
<v Speaker 2>converted in prison and changed yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd seeing it or seeing this group </v>

266
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.840
<v Speaker 2>and then I watched an interview after </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Beslan massacre where this group was</v>

267
00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:32.770
<v Speaker 2>saying in my hometown that if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to an English school,</v>

268
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.613
<v Speaker 2>it would be justified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also knew that that group openly </v>

269
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.780
<v Speaker 2>converting and recruiting in my town </v>
<v Speaker 2>center where my family go.</v>

270
00:13:41.781 --> 00:13:42.614
<v Speaker 2>Where were y'all go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were openly recruiting on the </v>

271
00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:44.924
<v Speaker 2>streets every single Saturday to send </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to fight for the Taliban against </v>

272
00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:50.990
<v Speaker 2>our armed forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was it for me.</v>

273
00:13:50.991 --> 00:13:54.200
<v Speaker 2>That was 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I organized my first demonstration.</v>

274
00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:55.034
<v Speaker 2>I was aged 21 years old and I organize a</v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstration called bandaloop and </v>

275
00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.313
<v Speaker 2>Taliban,</v>

276
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.200
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard to believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're actually recruiting in a town</v>

277
00:14:04.201 --> 00:14:05.034
<v Speaker 1>in England for the Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that a lot of Isis fighters are </v>

278
00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:08.814
<v Speaker 1>coming from England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're coming from all of western </v>

279
00:14:10.291 --> 00:14:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Europe basically going through Turkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>right into Syria.</v>

280
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.160
<v Speaker 1>What does law enforcement do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like not much,</v>

281
00:14:17.161 --> 00:14:17.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

282
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do nothing.</v>

283
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 2>So what I did when I organize this </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstration,</v>

284
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I actually made leaflets over 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago now and in those leaflets,</v>

285
00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:27.454
<v Speaker 2>what we're going back 12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this was before people had heard of </v>

286
00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 2>homegrown terrorism in the UK before </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have heard of these organizations</v>

287
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.863
<v Speaker 2>and in the leaflets I made a point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>our daughters and our sisters are being </v>

288
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:38.854
<v Speaker 2>groomed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we now know as an epidemic called </v>

289
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.253
<v Speaker 2>grooming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where groups of Muslim men </v>

290
00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:44.134
<v Speaker 2>would get young girls and their gang </v>
<v Speaker 2>raped them and it's become an epidemic </v>

291
00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:50.530
<v Speaker 2>across the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's been going on for 30 years.</v>

292
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.393
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever spoke about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twelve years ago I made a leaflet which </v>

293
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:58.400
<v Speaker 2>went on the front page and one national </v>
<v Speaker 2>news of my local newspaper saying whites</v>

294
00:14:58.401 --> 00:14:59.234
<v Speaker 2>and blacks are being religiously target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our women are being pimped and sexually </v>

295
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:07.160
<v Speaker 2>abused and prostituted by Muslim gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I named the Muslim gangs.</v>

296
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.080
<v Speaker 2>I named the extremist organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

297
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.143
<v Speaker 2>and I stood in the town center and read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read this leaflet out wherever I said </v>

298
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 2>that we demand that the police act with </v>
<v Speaker 2>demand that the council's act,</v>

299
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no action after that.</v>

300
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:22.940
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that happened was I was targeted.</v>

301
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I was targeted by Muslim gangs.</v>

302
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Can some of the blame here be blamed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something related to,</v>

303
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.890
<v Speaker 1>to British society that maybe we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have here in America,</v>

304
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:34.724
<v Speaker 1>America for all our faults and we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty of racial problems and all kinds </v>

305
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done the melting pot pretty well.</v>

306
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is come here no matter where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're from.</v>

307
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:46.390
<v Speaker 1>And pretty much mixed in bringing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions and then,</v>

308
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.253
<v Speaker 1>and then becoming American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like from the emails I'm </v>

309
00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:51.740
<v Speaker 1>getting from Denmark and Sweden and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

310
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 1>that something has happened in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess specifically in the UK where</v>

311
00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:56.864
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim population just hasn't </v>

312
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.170
<v Speaker 1>integrated the way that other immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 1>populations have been.</v>

313
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Some of that be on the fault of the UK </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just the Muslim population.</v>

314
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes it can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

315
00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.373
<v Speaker 2>It can be on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with multiculturalists who encouraged </v>

316
00:16:13.301 --> 00:16:14.134
<v Speaker 2>all these people to come here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told them that their culture was equal </v>

317
00:16:16.361 --> 00:16:17.194
<v Speaker 2>to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told them that they can go back into </v>

318
00:16:19.391 --> 00:16:22.060
<v Speaker 2>their own communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can live as they did in Afghanistan</v>

319
00:16:22.061 --> 00:16:23.670
<v Speaker 2>and Iraq and Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

320
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.490
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as anyone like ourselves try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to scratch beneath the surface to say,</v>

321
00:16:27.491 --> 00:16:29.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see where we differ culturally.</v>

322
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Let's see where our opinions differ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we've been screened down as racist.</v>

323
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.010
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

324
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.900
<v Speaker 2>and you say it's worked relatively well </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

325
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:38.800
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>

326
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.023
<v Speaker 2>You have nowhere near the percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims in comparison to Europe and it </v>

327
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.020
<v Speaker 2>and it will not work well in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the,</v>

328
00:16:45.021 --> 00:16:47.410
<v Speaker 2>that's the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you need to realize is that you need</v>

329
00:16:47.411 --> 00:16:48.244
<v Speaker 2>to learn from what's happening over here</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're going to face the same </v>

330
00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:50.974
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're ever uneducated Somalians </v>

331
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.523
<v Speaker 2>coming in uncontrollable numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will face exactly the same problems </v>

332
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've grown up with a loop.</v>

333
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.460
<v Speaker 2>If you allow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you allow Saudi Arabia,</v>

334
00:17:00.461 --> 00:17:02.010
<v Speaker 2>you allow guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you allow around,</v>

335
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.440
<v Speaker 2>you allow them footholds in your country</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Salafist or what hobbies mosques.</v>

336
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:08.530
<v Speaker 2>You allow them to build schools and </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach these children hatred.</v>

337
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:09.603
<v Speaker 2>You will in the next generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The experience in the height I </v>

338
00:17:11.861 --> 00:17:12.694
<v Speaker 2>experienced growing up.</v>

339
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.040
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think a town like yours </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it.</v>

340
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.973
<v Speaker 1>This has been growing for a long time as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying what should be done at </v>

341
00:17:21.701 --> 00:17:22.534
<v Speaker 1>this point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these people are citizens of the </v>

342
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:25.744
<v Speaker 1>UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what should be done to fight these </v>

343
00:17:27.971 --> 00:17:29.740
<v Speaker 1>ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the people,</v>

344
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.900
<v Speaker 1>but to fight these ideas that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>spreading.</v>

345
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.960
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

346
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.690
<v Speaker 2>what shouldn't be done is my local </v>
<v Speaker 2>counsel spend 188,000</v>

347
00:17:36.691 --> 00:17:40.710
<v Speaker 2>pounds of tax payers money given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given to the Salafist mosque.</v>

348
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a master.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Causes us huge problem that that's a mos</v>

349
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.080
<v Speaker 2>that went off set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went in into it.</v>

350
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.770
<v Speaker 2>They found books in the children's </v>
<v Speaker 2>school library for how to handsome fee.</v>

351
00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't be funding them.</v>

352
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.083
<v Speaker 2>We also should not be allowed in Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia or Qatar to fund these addresses </v>

353
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.620
<v Speaker 2>are popping up left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

354
00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 2>and center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be tough on,</v>

355
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:03.810
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on so many issues.</v>

356
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

357
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.423
<v Speaker 2>it's knowing where to start really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think towns that haven't had the </v>

358
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:12.540
<v Speaker 2>problems at Luton have had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be looking to our town looking at</v>

359
00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:13.374
<v Speaker 2>the infiltration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we've seen is the way the Muslims </v>

360
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 2>control themselves and the way they </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>

361
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Then our local council no longer care </v>
<v Speaker 2>about us.</v>

362
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 2>They don't care because we don't keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in power.</v>

363
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.280
<v Speaker 2>The Labor party are kept in power every </v>
<v Speaker 2>year in Luton by 30 to $50,000</v>

364
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 2>remotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we become irrelevant and that's spoke</v>

365
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.003
<v Speaker 2>bank politics and we don't vote based on</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's ethnicity or we don't vote on </v>

366
00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.560
<v Speaker 2>base somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's religion,</v>

367
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.360
<v Speaker 2>but the Muslim community do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all they vote.</v>

368
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

369
00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:44.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even as I'm talking to you,</v>

370
00:18:44.591 --> 00:18:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I have this feeling because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal,</v>

371
00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I have this feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:18:49.091 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 1>is he exaggerating this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this,</v>

373
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.740
<v Speaker 1>how big is this problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

374
00:18:53.741 --> 00:18:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I follow you on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tweet videos all day long,</v>

375
00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:57.870
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.770
<v Speaker 1>women being attacked either in the UK or</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Germany or wherever,</v>

377
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:03.843
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes I have trouble sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how much of this is </v>

378
00:19:07.451 --> 00:19:08.284
<v Speaker 1>actually happening all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big are the problem is versus is it </v>

379
00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:15.130
<v Speaker 1>just this micro problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

380
00:19:15.131 --> 00:19:17.140
<v Speaker 1>and I guess I guess your answer would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

381
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a micro problem in my town,</v>

382
00:19:19.271 --> 00:19:20.104
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's spreading into this big macro </v>

383
00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:21.994
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

384
00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.010
<v Speaker 2>The problem is bigger than anyone can </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehend.</v>

385
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the political leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why police forces,</v>

386
00:19:28.241 --> 00:19:31.600
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's now a fact in the UK </v>
<v Speaker 2>that police,</v>

387
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 2>social workers councils conspired to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hide these tracks for,</v>

388
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.930
<v Speaker 2>for decades.</v>

389
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Can go into that a little bit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a couple,</v>

390
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.430
<v Speaker 1>a couple controversies about that.</v>

391
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

392
00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:43.983
<v Speaker 2>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been a rover and rapport before </v>

393
00:19:45.891 --> 00:19:47.110
<v Speaker 2>this Robin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rapport Ppp.</v>

394
00:19:47.111 --> 00:19:47.944
<v Speaker 2>We used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people used to say I was lying or </v>

395
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.503
<v Speaker 2>inciting hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I choose to say it because it </v>

396
00:19:50.651 --> 00:19:51.484
<v Speaker 2>happened to my cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the similar sorts of crimes and we knew </v>

397
00:19:53.411 --> 00:19:57.070
<v Speaker 2>what the police reaction was then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was a robin report and in depth</v>

398
00:19:57.071 --> 00:20:01.330
<v Speaker 2>report into one little small town in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>north of England in that small town,</v>

399
00:20:01.331 --> 00:20:04.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a population of male Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are aged,</v>

400
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.650
<v Speaker 2>aged between 18 to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's about 3000 now in that town.</v>

401
00:20:08.651 --> 00:20:13.600
<v Speaker 2>They identified 1,400</v>
<v Speaker 2>young English girl who had been beaten,</v>

402
00:20:13.601 --> 00:20:16.900
<v Speaker 2>prostituted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and right in unbelievable numbers.</v>

403
00:20:16.901 --> 00:20:17.734
<v Speaker 2>Some of the goals right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 Times in one night and when they've </v>

404
00:20:20.021 --> 00:20:20.854
<v Speaker 2>done this big report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they've found in the report </v>

405
00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:23.704
<v Speaker 2>actually was the council knew full well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The head of the police knew the Muslim </v>

406
00:20:28.331 --> 00:20:32.020
<v Speaker 2>community knew everyone knew this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

407
00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.950
<v Speaker 2>but the reason why they'd done nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>was through the fear of being branded as</v>

408
00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:36.784
<v Speaker 2>racists.</v>

409
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.860
<v Speaker 2>That's how powerful political </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness is.</v>

410
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.903
<v Speaker 2>Now two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there circumstances in this report </v>

411
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.083
<v Speaker 2>where the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the police turned up and there was </v>

412
00:20:44.951 --> 00:20:45.784
<v Speaker 2>a young girl who was 11 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's been in a derelict house by five </v>

413
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Muslim men now when the police turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

414
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 2>they arrested the girl for being drunk </v>
<v Speaker 2>and disorderly.</v>

415
00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.523
<v Speaker 2>I let you've got to read the report that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to read the report and also </v>

416
00:20:58.781 --> 00:21:01.890
<v Speaker 2>there's another circumstance where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>go the go.</v>

417
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.853
<v Speaker 2>Two of the girls who were taken and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these girls were missing for days at 12 </v>

418
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 years old,</v>

419
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:07.720
<v Speaker 2>14 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to miss him for dates.</v>

420
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Two of the girls were taken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the dads went to get the girls back.</v>

421
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.440
<v Speaker 2>The goals were inside the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dads have gone to the Muslim's house</v>

422
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:16.420
<v Speaker 2>to get them back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the police turned up,</v>

423
00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:18.250
<v Speaker 2>the police arrested the English girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dads,</v>

424
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 2>they left the goat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so these sort of things,</v>

425
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:23.590
<v Speaker 2>which one of your view is that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound unbelievable.</v>

426
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 2>They sound unbelievable actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in a government report.</v>

427
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.340
<v Speaker 2>This is going on across our whole entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

428
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.460
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just going on in our country </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going on in Holland.</v>

429
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:34.940
<v Speaker 2>It's gone on across Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

430
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.793
<v Speaker 2>look at what's happening in Sweden and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is comes from a mindset and a </v>

431
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:43.960
<v Speaker 2>culture and an ideology that teaches </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that Muslim Muslim,</v>

432
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.990
<v Speaker 2>not just more women are inferior but not</v>
<v Speaker 2>non Muslim women like ours,</v>

433
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.473
<v Speaker 2>that dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that that's not all Muslims because </v>

434
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 2>some Muslims I've grown up with would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>as disgusted as we are,</v>

435
00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.383
<v Speaker 2>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a problem if you look at the </v>

436
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.633
<v Speaker 2>statistics for these not paedophilia </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the majority of pedophiles in </v>

437
00:22:04.271 --> 00:22:05.104
<v Speaker 2>the UK are white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you'd expect from a 90 percent </v>

438
00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:09.680
<v Speaker 2>white country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new,</v>

439
00:22:09.681 --> 00:22:14.681
<v Speaker 2>a new epidemic that men share young </v>
<v Speaker 2>children with their brothers,</v>

440
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.630
<v Speaker 2>their cousins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their work colleagues that the level,</v>

441
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:20.523
<v Speaker 2>the viewing of it within the community </v>
<v Speaker 2>or within the group is not viewed in a </v>

442
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:26.090
<v Speaker 2>similar way to how we would if it.</v>

443
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.430
<v Speaker 2>If a member of our community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

444
00:22:27.431 --> 00:22:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I've got this young 12 year old girl </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you'd fill them in,</v>

445
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:31.763
<v Speaker 2>but this is something very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different and it's new to the </v>

446
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:37.750
<v Speaker 2>country and what we're seeing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've seen it with Cologne again,</v>

447
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:38.584
<v Speaker 2>with on New Year's Eve is now been </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting people's faces more than ever </v>

448
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.890
<v Speaker 2>and we feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel I've got two young daughters.</v>

449
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.720
<v Speaker 2>I've got two young doors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to.</v>

450
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.730
<v Speaker 2>I was just speaking before about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor who,</v>

451
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.583
<v Speaker 2>who Angela Merkel's given a speech this </v>
<v Speaker 2>week in a university and the professor </v>

452
00:22:56.921 --> 00:22:59.470
<v Speaker 2>has stood up and he's heckled her and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

453
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have children.</v>

454
00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:02.740
<v Speaker 2>I have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

455
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:03.430
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

456
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.263
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What future are you bringing to our </v>

457
00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:05.854
<v Speaker 2>children?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an experiment you know nothing </v>

458
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.960
<v Speaker 2>about and that's the reality of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an experiment.</v>

459
00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 2>We know nothing about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what's going to happen.</v>

460
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.190
<v Speaker 2>We know what's going to happen from case</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies.</v>

461
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Luton town is a blueprint for the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the UK.</v>

462
00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a blueprint for the rest of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a blueprint for America.</v>

463
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 2>What's happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening everywhere.</v>

464
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly chilling,</v>

465
00:23:26.121 --> 00:23:27.500
<v Speaker 1>listening to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

466
00:23:27.501 --> 00:23:28.334
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I wanted to talk to you and </v>

467
00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.800
<v Speaker 1>try to get a sense of the size of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>

468
00:23:33.801 --> 00:23:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I saw a video this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see this?</v>

469
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:36.663
<v Speaker 1>A 16 year old girl posted a video from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany talking about how she went to </v>

470
00:23:41.871 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 1>her local supermarket and she saw these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys staring her and they were migraines</v>

471
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.000
<v Speaker 1>and they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She really be was a afraid for her life.</v>

472
00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 1>She posted a 20 minute video on </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

473
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.040
<v Speaker 1>which she clearly delineated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

474
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing against Muslim people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

475
00:23:57.621 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that are Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that stuff.</v>

476
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.250
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>

477
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 1>these specific people that are coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

478
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.650
<v Speaker 1>there's something different and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I understand,</v>

479
00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:07.484
<v Speaker 1>the video was taken down and she was at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least temporarily suspended from </v>

480
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:10.634
<v Speaker 1>facebook so that that really shows you </v>
<v Speaker 1>how perverse the political correctness </v>

481
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:16.700
<v Speaker 1>has got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If now facebook is in on it too.</v>

482
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook's completely.</v>

483
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.753
<v Speaker 2>Everyone keeps getting suspended for </v>
<v Speaker 2>posting videos or pictures of the </v>

484
00:24:22.501 --> 00:24:24.750
<v Speaker 2>reality and the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That young girl,</v>

485
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:26.723
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That angers me so much more than I can </v>

486
00:24:29.161 --> 00:24:32.850
<v Speaker 2>even express when I watched that and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could well up in my eyes and thinking,</v>

487
00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.260
<v Speaker 2>she's not free to walk to our shops in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany in 2016.</v>

488
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.333
<v Speaker 2>Why is she not free?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because hordes of hoards of Muslim men </v>

489
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.830
<v Speaker 2>are coming in from a completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different culture,</v>

490
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:44.963
<v Speaker 2>a completely different view on women are</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different that we have to </v>

491
00:24:47.641 --> 00:24:52.641
<v Speaker 2>understand their mindset and what gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>me is that I'm all for helping refugees.</v>

492
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.290
<v Speaker 2>These are not refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty percent,</v>

493
00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.203
<v Speaker 2>60 percent this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The EU commissioner has come out and </v>

494
00:24:58.891 --> 00:25:01.200
<v Speaker 2>said they're economic migrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty percent.</v>

495
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Angela Merkel was open those borders to </v>
<v Speaker 2>one and a half million last year.</v>

496
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.143
<v Speaker 2>There is going to be a flood in the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming years of tens of millions of </v>

497
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.813
<v Speaker 2>Muslims come into come into Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come into our continent where that go </v>

498
00:25:15.751 --> 00:25:19.470
<v Speaker 2>and her feeling is just going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural to everybody.</v>

499
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's going to be feeling and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't feel fearful.</v>

500
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.160
<v Speaker 2>When our in our own homes and towns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do all we had,</v>

501
00:25:26.161 --> 00:25:26.994
<v Speaker 2>all I ever hear about is Islamophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All we ever hear about is that Muslim </v>

502
00:25:29.941 --> 00:25:31.590
<v Speaker 2>women are scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not being funny,</v>

503
00:25:31.591 --> 00:25:36.450
<v Speaker 2>but no one's raped Muslim women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one is gang rape in Muslim women.</v>

504
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.000
<v Speaker 2>No young Muslim goals were attacked on </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Year's Eve.</v>

505
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.970
<v Speaker 2>No Muslim has had their heads hate cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>off in the street.</v>

506
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not happening to Muslims and,</v>

507
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.713
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where when we look at the </v>

508
00:25:47.281 --> 00:25:48.114
<v Speaker 2>target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had a meeting this week with lead </v>

509
00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.430
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a leading of a seek,</v>

510
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.570
<v Speaker 2>a safe organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should talk to him.</v>

511
00:25:54.571 --> 00:25:55.404
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can give you a real in depth of </v>

512
00:25:56.311 --> 00:25:58.470
<v Speaker 2>what's going on from a sales </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

513
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.083
<v Speaker 2>He deals with hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>young children who have been taken from </v>

514
00:26:03.331 --> 00:26:04.800
<v Speaker 2>their families by Muslim gangs.</v>

515
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the most recent one when I went </v>

516
00:26:07.441 --> 00:26:09.450
<v Speaker 2>with a radio presenter and the radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>presenter said,</v>

517
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.850
<v Speaker 2>where's got nothing to do with religion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

518
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.773
<v Speaker 2>well actually everything they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the girls while rape is about </v>

519
00:26:15.871 --> 00:26:16.704
<v Speaker 2>religion is a religion or race or I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>go through the court cases where there </v>

520
00:26:20.461 --> 00:26:21.294
<v Speaker 2>was a smiley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smiley and rape gang down in Bristol in </v>

521
00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:24.414
<v Speaker 2>the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he actually said it was his </v>

522
00:26:25.591 --> 00:26:27.660
<v Speaker 2>religious duty to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really.</v>

523
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.690
<v Speaker 2>And these are not what we're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're saying.</v>

524
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.240
<v Speaker 2>They're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you white trash,</v>

525
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:33.074
<v Speaker 2>you whitefield will gut you like a pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these comments are being made to </v>

526
00:26:36.991 --> 00:26:41.430
<v Speaker 2>these young English girls and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone wants to get around.</v>

527
00:26:41.431 --> 00:26:42.390
<v Speaker 2>The fact is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

528
00:26:42.391 --> 00:26:44.520
<v Speaker 2>everyone's or everyone does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

529
00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:47.730
<v Speaker 2>not 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 90 percent of the convictions,</v>

530
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 2>the street gang grooming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our Muslim men have a population of four</v>

531
00:26:51.991 --> 00:26:52.810
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

532
00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:53.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:26:53.261 --> 00:26:54.094
<v Speaker 1>I really am starting to see this as </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost a disease of the mind of people </v>

534
00:26:57.821 --> 00:26:58.654
<v Speaker 1>on the left because even if even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you were saying was being </v>

535
00:27:01.931 --> 00:27:05.080
<v Speaker 1>magnified by 20 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 percent,</v>

536
00:27:05.081 --> 00:27:07.380
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're totally doubling the,</v>

537
00:27:07.381 --> 00:27:10.420
<v Speaker 1>the severity of all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still a problem.</v>

538
00:27:10.421 --> 00:27:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And every time I hear my friends on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left talk about it,</v>

539
00:27:13.751 --> 00:27:15.280
<v Speaker 1>they'll immediately say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

540
00:27:15.281 --> 00:27:16.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

541
00:27:16.451 --> 00:27:21.451
<v Speaker 1>there were the crusades or the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Church has covered up molesting children</v>

542
00:27:21.791 --> 00:27:23.170
<v Speaker 1>for hundreds of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things.</v>

543
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.870
<v Speaker 1>No one's denying those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

544
00:27:25.871 --> 00:27:28.030
<v Speaker 1>And some of those things are still </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening right now,</v>

545
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.460
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about isn't a problem.</v>

546
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:34.443
<v Speaker 1>So my question to you is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when in the UK did the left go off the </v>

547
00:27:38.291 --> 00:27:39.124
<v Speaker 1>deep end,</v>

548
00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.810
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will I keep trying to say?</v>

549
00:27:41.811 --> 00:27:42.644
<v Speaker 2>And I've tried to save for six years now</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a left wing or right wing </v>

550
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:49.490
<v Speaker 2>issue because people will automatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>pigeonhole myself as right wing or no,</v>

551
00:27:49.491 --> 00:27:51.650
<v Speaker 2>actually that's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pigeon holed as far.</v>

552
00:27:51.651 --> 00:27:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

553
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Or Am I ugly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

554
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:55.993
<v Speaker 2>whereas the majority of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>supported my organization over the </v>

555
00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.173
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them would have been left wing </v>

556
00:28:00.261 --> 00:28:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Labor votes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

557
00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

558
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.623
<v Speaker 1>to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason they'd be left wing is </v>

559
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:06.570
<v Speaker 1>because they're for women's rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

560
00:28:06.571 --> 00:28:09.810
<v Speaker 1>And they're probably for gay rights and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're generally for minorities.</v>

561
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 1>So they should fit on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

562
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.490
<v Speaker 2>that'd been pushed and forced to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

563
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.553
<v Speaker 2>And that's because the left in the UK </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically rely and have basically the </v>

564
00:28:25.641 --> 00:28:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Labour party in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

565
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.163
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're loyal vote bank used to be </v>

566
00:28:29.511 --> 00:28:31.370
<v Speaker 2>working class people like myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

567
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.693
<v Speaker 2>In,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in England we have a very classist </v>

568
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.353
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you've experienced the </v>

569
00:28:35.121 --> 00:28:37.310
<v Speaker 2>same in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have a very classist system.</v>

570
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.370
<v Speaker 2>We have the bottom and the top and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have what is fundamentally,</v>

571
00:28:40.371 --> 00:28:41.204
<v Speaker 2>usually conservative people were very </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy and working class people are </v>

572
00:28:43.881 --> 00:28:46.910
<v Speaker 2>usually quite poor or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not quite poor,</v>

573
00:28:46.911 --> 00:28:49.820
<v Speaker 2>but Paul and proud anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we.</v>

574
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.810
<v Speaker 2>What we then see is that as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as as working class people started doing</v>

575
00:28:53.811 --> 00:28:54.644
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would then aspire to be </v>

576
00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.130
<v Speaker 2>conservative because they get more </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

577
00:28:58.131 --> 00:28:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

578
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.760
<v Speaker 2>So then it seems that the Labor Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just completely give up on this,</v>

579
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.773
<v Speaker 2>on this section of the community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they went straight for which Tony </v>

580
00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Blair is.</v>

581
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:10.180
<v Speaker 2>That government has have admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring in in loyal votes,</v>

582
00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.920
<v Speaker 2>which were immigrants which have now </v>
<v Speaker 2>become Muslims.</v>

583
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.800
<v Speaker 2>There's one speech where you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can watch it.</v>

584
00:29:16.801 --> 00:29:20.400
<v Speaker 2>It's his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He'd met Malik and he's a.</v>

585
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.430
<v Speaker 2>He was a Labor MP for Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brie.</v>

586
00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.290
<v Speaker 2>And in his speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he clearly tells us,</v>

587
00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2001 we had one Muslim MP in 2004,</v>

588
00:29:27.561 --> 00:29:31.000
<v Speaker 2>we had free freedom is an MP in 2008 we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had eight Ms Dot mmps.</v>

589
00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.810
<v Speaker 2>And in between saying each thing he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

590
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.440
<v Speaker 2>inshallah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inshallah and up.</v>

591
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.670
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been 15 years in this country.</v>

592
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.400
<v Speaker 2>The majority of Mps will be Muslim and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then or the crowd,</v>

593
00:29:40.401 --> 00:29:44.800
<v Speaker 2>which is a thousand or cheer and clap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he says in,</v>

594
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 2>within 30 years the prime minister of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this nation will share our faith.</v>

595
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or say,</v>

596
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.240
<v Speaker 2>don't listen to what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of Muslims.</v>

597
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.270
<v Speaker 2>And when he says this as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representative for the Labor Party,</v>

598
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.750
<v Speaker 2>this is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you mix religion with politics,</v>

599
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.840
<v Speaker 2>which is now happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just it goes like this.</v>

600
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Now actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

601
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.053
<v Speaker 2>we have the Labor Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the leading left wing </v>

602
00:30:08.651 --> 00:30:12.070
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they have their meetings in Muslim,</v>

603
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:15.460
<v Speaker 2>predominantly cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they segregate the odd audiences.</v>

604
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.900
<v Speaker 2>They segregate the audience is men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women in law,</v>

605
00:30:18.901 --> 00:30:21.880
<v Speaker 2>in with Sharia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a party that's supposed to stand</v>

606
00:30:21.881 --> 00:30:24.510
<v Speaker 2>up for women that's supposed to stand up</v>
<v Speaker 2>for gay people's rights.</v>

607
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.653
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have our contempt and disgust with </v>

608
00:30:27.771 --> 00:30:28.604
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Labor Party and the left have </v>

609
00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:30.844
<v Speaker 2>now become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean all left wing </v>

610
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:32.674
<v Speaker 2>people because Islam is something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>should concern and especially the </v>

611
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:36.603
<v Speaker 2>literal interpretations of it shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>concern everybody on the left and every </v>

612
00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:41.680
<v Speaker 2>liberal should be screaming from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rooftops or what's happening.</v>

613
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

614
00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.693
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish they were so just as long as </v>

615
00:30:45.231 --> 00:30:46.670
<v Speaker 1>we're going on the political side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

616
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.000
<v Speaker 1>You were part of the British National </v>
<v Speaker 1>Party for a while,</v>

617
00:30:50.001 --> 00:30:50.834
<v Speaker 1>I think about 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you left because you thought they </v>

618
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:55.310
<v Speaker 1>were going too far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

619
00:30:55.311 --> 00:30:58.760
<v Speaker 1>You thought they were becoming racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that caused you to leave.</v>

620
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened was that,</v>

621
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.333
<v Speaker 2>that was when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I spoke about the pendulum school </v>

622
00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.460
<v Speaker 2>massacre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which when I was 21,</v>

623
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.360
<v Speaker 2>I started looking online to find who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about these things.</v>

624
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.673
<v Speaker 2>And there was only one group talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and they were called the British </v>

625
00:31:11.971 --> 00:31:13.680
<v Speaker 2>national Pi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

626
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.870
<v Speaker 2>I joined the British National Party on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 month.</v>

627
00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.813
<v Speaker 2>They had a meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went along to the meeting and I </v>

628
00:31:18.661 --> 00:31:19.494
<v Speaker 2>joined in that meeting in my hometown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They then set up a second meeting where </v>

629
00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:24.414
<v Speaker 2>we were going to bring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our friends were not turned up with my </v>

630
00:31:26.041 --> 00:31:28.980
<v Speaker 2>friends to the second meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said he can't come in,</v>

631
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.873
<v Speaker 2>he can't come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the black lines with these </v>

632
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.630
<v Speaker 2>English lads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

633
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.730
<v Speaker 2>they're my best friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they said they can't come in.</v>

634
00:31:35.731 --> 00:31:37.290
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean they can't come in?</v>

635
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.470
<v Speaker 2>And they saw non non white people can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>join the British National Party.</v>

636
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Now I was 21 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never involved in politics,</v>

637
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:46.410
<v Speaker 2>never an interest in policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't realize then that the leader</v>

638
00:31:46.411 --> 00:31:48.180
<v Speaker 2>of this organization is named Nick </v>
<v Speaker 2>Griffin.</v>

639
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.313
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize he was a holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 2>denier or didn't realize that I didn't </v>

640
00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:54.960
<v Speaker 2>realize that he used to be leader of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Front and RC organization.</v>

641
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:56.243
<v Speaker 2>And so from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which there was a leaked membership </v>

642
00:31:58.321 --> 00:31:59.970
<v Speaker 2>list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how people know I as a member,</v>

643
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.070
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't rejoin the next three </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

644
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.980
<v Speaker 2>That was my flirtation with the British </v>
<v Speaker 2>National Party was done.</v>

645
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Or then in 2009,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about five years later,</v>

646
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:10.763
<v Speaker 2>I sat the English Defense League.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I set that up based on my own </v>

647
00:32:13.741 --> 00:32:14.820
<v Speaker 2>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

648
00:32:14.821 --> 00:32:15.654
<v Speaker 2>where anyone can join.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually went onto have a Sikh </v>

649
00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:22.530
<v Speaker 2>division I lesbian and gay division,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Jewish division.</v>

650
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.693
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anyone that's affected by these </v>

651
00:32:25.141 --> 00:32:25.974
<v Speaker 2>problems because I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've grown up in a town where I don't </v>

652
00:32:29.131 --> 00:32:30.900
<v Speaker 2>care about other cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about.</v>

653
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're straight.</v>

654
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:39.180
<v Speaker 2>None of that bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My problem is with this radical,</v>

655
00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:40.443
<v Speaker 2>this radical ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is going to cause us all serious </v>

656
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:43.184
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's up.</v>

657
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.200
<v Speaker 2>But like did leave the English Defense </v>
<v Speaker 2>League as well?</v>

658
00:32:45.201 --> 00:32:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left in 2013.</v>

659
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I left because I found that a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

660
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:52.880
<v Speaker 2>The majority of my time actually it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>not spent trying to tackle the issues it</v>

661
00:32:52.881 --> 00:32:57.500
<v Speaker 2>was spent trying to keep backward inbred</v>
<v Speaker 2>far right Nazis out of the movement.</v>

662
00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a really interesting point and</v>

663
00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it's sort of illuminates your </v>
<v Speaker 1>story a lot,</v>

664
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:02.774
<v Speaker 1>so to be clear you left one party </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't want black people </v>

665
00:33:06.921 --> 00:33:07.754
<v Speaker 1>basically in their party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you started the edl where </v>

666
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:14.030
<v Speaker 1>you had plenty of people from all walks </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life joining you,</v>

667
00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:16.790
<v Speaker 1>you ended up leaving that too because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>went too far.</v>

668
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:17.624
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people paint you as this ultra </v>

669
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:20.144
<v Speaker 1>right nationalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they agree with all the other </v>

670
00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:23.930
<v Speaker 1>stuff you're saying or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just.</v>

671
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It just isn't true from any estimation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can see</v>

672
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.580
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can spend five minutes on Google,</v>

673
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:30.503
<v Speaker 2>you can go to these ultra right wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazi nationalist organizations and see </v>

674
00:33:34.831 --> 00:33:35.664
<v Speaker 2>what they think of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get just as many death threats from </v>

675
00:33:38.011 --> 00:33:41.150
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm known as the real far away.</v>

676
00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:43.250
<v Speaker 2>See what happens is I get called fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

677
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.650
<v Speaker 2>The real far right in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Zionist.</v>

678
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why from the real Pharma,</v>

679
00:33:50.291 --> 00:33:51.270
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

680
00:33:51.271 --> 00:33:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

681
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.253
<v Speaker 1>So real quick though on when you left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the edl that was facilitated by </v>

682
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.303
<v Speaker 1>Quilliam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is marginalizes organization </v>

683
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 1>that's trying to foster coexistence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had my jacket on.</v>

684
00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hugely admire him.</v>

685
00:34:05.721 --> 00:34:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Can you just real quick explain how he </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped facilitate you getting out?</v>

686
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I was leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was leaving the organization anyway,</v>

687
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.730
<v Speaker 2>so I was leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd made the decision I was leaving.</v>

688
00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:16.893
<v Speaker 2>I then met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine the was and I'd known of their </v>

689
00:34:19.861 --> 00:34:21.940
<v Speaker 2>organization and some of the work that </v>
<v Speaker 2>done anyway.</v>

690
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm honest,</v>

691
00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.970
<v Speaker 2>it benefit me and it benefited him at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time and I'm,</v>

692
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.770
<v Speaker 2>that's just me being completely honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

693
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.653
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I then spent some time with </v>

694
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Quilliam who are seen as reformist </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims.</v>

695
00:34:34.751 --> 00:34:35.584
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I realized it was the many of them </v>

696
00:34:38.141 --> 00:34:39.580
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're honest,</v>

697
00:34:39.581 --> 00:34:41.460
<v Speaker 2>are apostates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

698
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:43.240
<v Speaker 2>they don't follow the teachings of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>

699
00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:45.700
<v Speaker 2>which is why they're saying able to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do,</v>

700
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.320
<v Speaker 2>but then because of that</v>

701
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:49.210
<v Speaker 1>softening the blow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

702
00:34:49.211 --> 00:34:51.760
<v Speaker 1>they're not coming out right and saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't believe in this.</v>

703
00:34:51.761 --> 00:34:52.594
<v Speaker 1>They're saying we're trying to reform it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because that's a little more </v>

704
00:34:54.131 --> 00:34:55.120
<v Speaker 1>palatable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>

705
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then their target that I actually </v>

706
00:34:57.651 --> 00:34:58.484
<v Speaker 2>hate it more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're actually hated more than me by </v>

707
00:35:03.171 --> 00:35:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Muslims and then the more time I spent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

708
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I met Majeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Sama,</v>

709
00:35:08.331 --> 00:35:09.164
<v Speaker 2>has a summer seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still site is one of the most sincere </v>

710
00:35:11.511 --> 00:35:14.310
<v Speaker 2>and decent men I've met in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>

711
00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:18.950
<v Speaker 2>They're not being entirely honest with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the public about where we're at.</v>

712
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:24.100
<v Speaker 2>I've done some training in there and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was taught that when we talk about Islam</v>

713
00:35:24.101 --> 00:35:24.934
<v Speaker 2>missed so that the acceptable word now </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we're against Islam is we're </v>

714
00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:29.403
<v Speaker 2>against Islamism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which if so then what they said is </v>

715
00:35:32.151 --> 00:35:32.984
<v Speaker 2>Islamist ideology and they wrote a graph</v>
<v Speaker 2>and through this chart and it was </v>

716
00:35:35.961 --> 00:35:38.970
<v Speaker 2>punishment for adultery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a punishment for homosexuality.</v>

717
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.043
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the older backward ideas that come out </v>

718
00:35:41.101 --> 00:35:42.030
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

719
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 2>and they said that 90 percent of mosques</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UK are propagating this.</v>

720
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Not Ninety percent of the Muslims in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mosque,</v>

721
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.263
<v Speaker 2>but 90 percent of the mosque because </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's funding and controlling them and </v>

722
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:54.414
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy and the teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the mom's 90 percent of whom can't </v>

723
00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:58.150
<v Speaker 2>speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iva,</v>

724
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 2>they're 90 percent of the Masa propagate</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Islamist ideology and they.</v>

725
00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:05.580
<v Speaker 2>They had Islamist ideology under folks </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam and then they had true Islam,</v>

726
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:08.970
<v Speaker 2>which I said 10 percent work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but obviously I have a huge problem with</v>

727
00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:13.110
<v Speaker 2>this because if 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>propagating this in the UK,</v>

728
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.033
<v Speaker 2>that's true Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get what you're trying to do and I </v>

729
00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:17.034
<v Speaker 2>wish you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish you every success in trying to </v>

730
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:21.960
<v Speaker 2>change this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've had 1400 years of history that</v>

731
00:36:21.961 --> 00:36:25.020
<v Speaker 2>shows it hasn't changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting a battle now where,</v>

732
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.640
<v Speaker 2>and I asked him when the last time I saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Sama,</v>

733
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.201
<v Speaker 2>Sandra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

734
00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 2>how many people have you converted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your liberal form of Islam this week?</v>

735
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:32.783
<v Speaker 2>Because while you've been doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical extremists in prisons across </v>

736
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:37.224
<v Speaker 2>this country and Taoist tools across </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country are probably converted </v>

737
00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:40.220
<v Speaker 2>thousands.</v>

738
00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to get to the prison part and</v>

739
00:36:41.781 --> 00:36:45.800
<v Speaker 1>a little bit because you've had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely insane experiences in prison,</v>

740
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:46.933
<v Speaker 1>but just to wrap this part up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interesting piece here is that </v>

741
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.810
<v Speaker 1>although you're not working with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>jihad now you guys in your own way,</v>

742
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you're both apostates to your community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's considered,</v>

743
00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:58.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see all the horrible things that </v>

744
00:36:59.661 --> 00:37:00.494
<v Speaker 1>people call him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>porch monkey and terrible things coming </v>

745
00:37:02.931 --> 00:37:03.764
<v Speaker 1>out of the Muslim community saying about</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and coming from white people on the </v>

746
00:37:07.071 --> 00:37:07.904
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they'd be considered racist if </v>

747
00:37:09.261 --> 00:37:11.510
<v Speaker 1>they said it about about a black person </v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

748
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:12.493
<v Speaker 1>but in a way you both are now sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcasts and that kind of brings you </v>

749
00:37:16.371 --> 00:37:17.960
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which to me,</v>

750
00:37:17.961 --> 00:37:18.794
<v Speaker 1>that's where the real conversation is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you work with him or kill him </v>

751
00:37:22.251 --> 00:37:23.270
<v Speaker 1>ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

752
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:25.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the lane that this has to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

753
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.110
<v Speaker 2>The conversation is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this isn't a time for conversation.</v>

754
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:31.303
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could rely on Muslims to solve </v>

755
00:37:34.101 --> 00:37:36.530
<v Speaker 2>this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm at the opinion now,</v>

756
00:37:36.531 --> 00:37:37.970
<v Speaker 2>we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>

757
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.133
<v Speaker 2>I think I spent two years float in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>with different groups and talking to </v>

758
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.680
<v Speaker 2>every moderate Muslim I'm introduced to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just tomorrow night in the UK.</v>

759
00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:49.490
<v Speaker 2>There's a BBC radio four program and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went last week because we're going and I</v>

760
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:50.383
<v Speaker 2>traveled round me in Muslim leaders </v>
<v Speaker 2>again and when I met this account or </v>

761
00:37:53.661 --> 00:37:54.494
<v Speaker 2>extremism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>counter terrorism hailed as the most </v>

762
00:37:56.631 --> 00:38:00.200
<v Speaker 2>moderate of Muslims you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I sat down with him,</v>

763
00:38:00.201 --> 00:38:01.034
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you please condemn punishment for </v>

764
00:38:02.271 --> 00:38:03.104
<v Speaker 2>apostasy in the Islamic states?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether that be in Saudi Arabia just </v>

765
00:38:06.711 --> 00:38:07.930
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please condemn it,</v>

766
00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.920
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

767
00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:10.754
<v Speaker 2>you can't even condemn that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone has the freedom to think you </v>

768
00:38:12.681 --> 00:38:13.490
<v Speaker 2>can't even do that.</v>

769
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.821
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

770
00:38:13.821 --> 00:38:15.260
<v Speaker 2>we're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said it.</v>

771
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.420
<v Speaker 2>That's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not difficult if you want people to</v>

772
00:38:17.421 --> 00:38:19.160
<v Speaker 2>be punished for thinking a different way</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you don't,</v>

773
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.940
<v Speaker 2>and this is another Muslim that's hailed</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the most moderate and to be honest,</v>

774
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.180
<v Speaker 2>if I can't say I've met one of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>match in the West other than some of the</v>

775
00:38:28.221 --> 00:38:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Muslims in Quilliam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than that,</v>

776
00:38:29.931 --> 00:38:32.290
<v Speaker 2>older and older Muslims I've met and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>

777
00:38:32.291 --> 00:38:33.124
<v Speaker 2>I've pushed them on questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found that once I scratched onto </v>

778
00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.950
<v Speaker 2>beneath the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually they hold some quite a point of</v>

779
00:38:37.951 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do and if it was time for,</v>

780
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:42.723
<v Speaker 2>if Muslims could solve this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the combined military force around </v>

781
00:38:45.341 --> 00:38:46.174
<v Speaker 2>in 50 to 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>isis soldiers or Isis Millan's is up to </v>

782
00:38:49.301 --> 00:38:52.360
<v Speaker 2>$5,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>combined military force and they've done</v>

783
00:38:52.361 --> 00:38:55.720
<v Speaker 2>nothing and they're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

784
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.580
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to do things now.</v>

785
00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.443
<v Speaker 2>We have to enforce laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to push agendas that are going </v>

786
00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:02.314
<v Speaker 2>to make sure that we're secure and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that we are not just secure </v>

787
00:39:04.811 --> 00:39:07.680
<v Speaker 2>but stable in the future and we can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>rely on Muslims to do.</v>

788
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:08.643
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you bring up some of what's going on </v>

789
00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:14.560
<v Speaker 1>with the prison system in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been to prison a couple times.</v>

790
00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about two weeks ago.</v>

791
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.310
<v Speaker 1>You might've been in prison for a day or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

792
00:39:18.311 --> 00:39:19.144
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

793
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been arrested and charged again.</v>

794
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

795
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to get too much into the</v>

796
00:39:24.901 --> 00:39:28.770
<v Speaker 1>things that you've been arrested for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them sound like extremely jumped</v>

797
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:29.723
<v Speaker 1>a trumped up charges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a lot of what your book is </v>

798
00:39:31.591 --> 00:39:34.710
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can you talk a little bit about what</v>

799
00:39:34.711 --> 00:39:35.544
<v Speaker 1>your experience was like in prison and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how powerful the ideas of Islamism are </v>

800
00:39:41.431 --> 00:39:43.230
<v Speaker 1>actually spreading in the prison system?</v>

801
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the first time I went to custody in</v>

802
00:39:46.611 --> 00:39:47.444
<v Speaker 2>2004,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2005 things have moved forward very </v>

803
00:39:51.411 --> 00:39:53.460
<v Speaker 2>quickly within the prison system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to say.</v>

804
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Then the next time that I went back into</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison was um,</v>

805
00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.220
<v Speaker 2>2010 for actually illegally enter enter </v>
<v Speaker 2>in America,</v>

806
00:40:01.221 --> 00:40:02.650
<v Speaker 2>but that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

807
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:03.523
<v Speaker 2>2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I've witnessed each time I've </v>

808
00:40:05.931 --> 00:40:10.931
<v Speaker 2>been in custody would terrify anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I honestly say that if you could see</v>

809
00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:12.943
<v Speaker 2>the maximum security prisons that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most dangerous prisoners and most </v>

810
00:40:16.371 --> 00:40:20.090
<v Speaker 2>dangerous men in the UK are being used </v>
<v Speaker 2>as ics training camps,</v>

811
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:23.000
<v Speaker 2>training camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white labs,</v>

812
00:40:23.001 --> 00:40:25.130
<v Speaker 2>the black glass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is converting,</v>

813
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:30.190
<v Speaker 2>everyone has a big huge bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the biggest gang in the system.</v>

814
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.590
<v Speaker 2>And it's something that the authorities </v>
<v Speaker 2>have not got grip off.</v>

815
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.800
<v Speaker 2>They can't control the mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless them.</v>

816
00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are trying,</v>

817
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're seen as student.</v>

818
00:40:40.711 --> 00:40:42.580
<v Speaker 2>He has to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the moms,</v>

819
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:43.723
<v Speaker 2>people are not taking their Shahada and </v>
<v Speaker 2>converting to Islam in the mosque on </v>

820
00:40:46.401 --> 00:40:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

821
00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.880
<v Speaker 2>they're doing on the wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the prisoners wings.</v>

822
00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:50.960
<v Speaker 2>They run their own mosques.</v>

823
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.753
<v Speaker 1>So this is going to sound sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>amateurish because I've never been to </v>

824
00:40:54.861 --> 00:40:56.450
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you've been there,</v>

825
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.450
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how is it that these ideas spread?</v>

826
00:40:59.451 --> 00:41:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that the prison system is </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing,</v>

827
00:41:02.161 --> 00:41:03.710
<v Speaker 1>and I know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is in the United States,</v>

828
00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:04.544
<v Speaker 1>do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all kinds of crazy religious </v>

829
00:41:05.571 --> 00:41:08.600
<v Speaker 1>stuff that goes on in prisons and drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>deals and all,</v>

830
00:41:08.601 --> 00:41:09.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all nuts.</v>

831
00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:13.850
<v Speaker 1>But what is going on that that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>even allowing these ideas,</v>

832
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:14.843
<v Speaker 1>bread,</v>

833
00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:15.980
<v Speaker 2>they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop them.</v>

834
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's say Islam forms of Providence.</v>

835
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.900
<v Speaker 2>I probably heard you mess with one </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim.</v>

836
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:29.670
<v Speaker 2>You mess with every Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in some instances Islam is being used</v>

837
00:41:29.671 --> 00:41:30.504
<v Speaker 2>within the prison system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used for power control and money is </v>

838
00:41:33.471 --> 00:41:35.330
<v Speaker 2>something that anyone can attach </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to.</v>

839
00:41:35.331 --> 00:41:36.164
<v Speaker 2>And and that's what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also been orchestrated and </v>

840
00:41:38.181 --> 00:41:39.014
<v Speaker 2>organized to you see in in British </v>
<v Speaker 2>prisons where if a Muslim gets another </v>

841
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:46.460
<v Speaker 2>non-muslims convert outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sources are sending them in money.</v>

842
00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:47.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To.</v>

843
00:41:47.641 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 2>And also if you know the ideology of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>

844
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.280
<v Speaker 2>it's the pathway to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For them,</v>

845
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.560
<v Speaker 2>it's the pathway to heaven is to spread </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>

846
00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:55.394
<v Speaker 2>to spread dour and to convert prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you're seeing then is some of </v>

847
00:41:58.311 --> 00:42:02.000
<v Speaker 2>the most dangerous and extreme people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK are converting to Islam.</v>

848
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.970
<v Speaker 2>And it also gives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say it's powerful,</v>

849
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.833
<v Speaker 2>we look in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've lost our identity through </v>

850
00:42:08.421 --> 00:42:11.030
<v Speaker 2>political correctness and for years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of being beaten down.</v>

851
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.580
<v Speaker 2>English people have lost their </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

852
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.073
<v Speaker 2>We don't have the community feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim community have and when </v>

853
00:42:18.591 --> 00:42:21.470
<v Speaker 2>you've lost your identity and your tour </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and time again,</v>

854
00:42:21.471 --> 00:42:22.304
<v Speaker 2>or you're told Time and time again that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your identity and your culture and your </v>

855
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 2>history is not good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then and then comes along this,</v>

856
00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:29.123
<v Speaker 2>this powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful community that will stick </v>

857
00:42:32.211 --> 00:42:33.044
<v Speaker 2>together and we and you'll never be on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own and it gives them everything </v>

858
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:38.960
<v Speaker 2>they had been searching for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to remember a lot of people who</v>

859
00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:43.100
<v Speaker 2>are in the prison system have been wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>their whole life from a very young age.</v>

860
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.720
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've done a lot of wrong as well,</v>

861
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 2>but there's a reason many of them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chose that path.</v>

862
00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:48.520
<v Speaker 2>They've started with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've had nothing.</v>

863
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.990
<v Speaker 2>They've got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam gives them a course.</v>

864
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 2>It gives them something to fight for.</v>

865
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.060
<v Speaker 2>It gives them something to concentrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it and it all.</v>

866
00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.113
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I saw happening in the prison </v>

867
00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:00.284
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how we're gonna deal with </v>

868
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.670
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think steps we can take.</v>

869
00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:08.120
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the statistics in French </v>
<v Speaker 2>prisons that have a population of,</v>

870
00:43:08.121 --> 00:43:13.121
<v Speaker 2>I believe seven percent Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of the prisoners on Muslim in</v>

871
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:16.670
<v Speaker 2>the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spoke to prison officers who said that</v>

872
00:43:16.671 --> 00:43:17.504
<v Speaker 2>in one week they had 60 conversions </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a Muslim gang had come into the </v>

873
00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:24.380
<v Speaker 2>prison and just started beating an </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack and everybody to convert and then</v>

874
00:43:24.381 --> 00:43:26.960
<v Speaker 2>before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone just converse for the,</v>

875
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.690
<v Speaker 2>for the easy time because if you're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble when you want protection,</v>

876
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:30.480
<v Speaker 2>you convert.</v>

877
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.570
<v Speaker 1>So when you were in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of being beaten,</v>

878
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.530
<v Speaker 1>you were beaten basically to a pulp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

879
00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean all your teeth knocked out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really some horrible stuff,</v>

880
00:43:40.891 --> 00:43:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but you'd never converted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did you even,</v>

881
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:47.100
<v Speaker 1>or I guess just talk about the violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were subjected to first.</v>

882
00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.513
<v Speaker 2>So I was in the UK prison system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have laws and rules that they have </v>

883
00:43:51.581 --> 00:43:52.414
<v Speaker 2>to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a duty of care for every </v>

884
00:43:53.441 --> 00:43:54.274
<v Speaker 2>prisoner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what they did when against every </v>

885
00:43:57.311 --> 00:43:59.220
<v Speaker 2>single one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm under no doubt.</v>

886
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.811
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

887
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:00.644
<v Speaker 2>if I taught when I was taken to woodhill</v>
<v Speaker 2>here was a maximum security prison in </v>

888
00:44:03.431 --> 00:44:04.270
<v Speaker 2>the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the houses,</v>

889
00:44:04.271 --> 00:44:06.520
<v Speaker 2>some of the country's most feared and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous terrorists.</v>

890
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I was in prison for a financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>irregularity on a form for that,</v>

891
00:44:12.401 --> 00:44:13.234
<v Speaker 2>for that offense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to an open prison where you go </v>

892
00:44:15.071 --> 00:44:15.904
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was taken to a maximum security </v>

893
00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:18.970
<v Speaker 2>category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a prison.</v>

894
00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I was Po,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Po,</v>

895
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:24.550
<v Speaker 2>po in my cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that very first day when my daughter</v>

896
00:44:24.551 --> 00:44:27.340
<v Speaker 2>first I opened it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an ex world marine commando who's</v>

897
00:44:27.341 --> 00:44:28.960
<v Speaker 2>a British,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the British military,</v>

898
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.470
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they come to get you from cell,</v>

899
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.230
<v Speaker 2>do not leave this cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went,</v>

900
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:33.960
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

901
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.160
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're life depends on it.</v>

902
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.033
<v Speaker 2>Don't leave this cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then 10 minutes late he's come with </v>

903
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 2>two other prison officers and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

904
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:41.063
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I'll say that I'm not going </v>

905
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

906
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:45.503
<v Speaker 2>I'm not leaving this cell because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't leave the so I didn't get </v>

907
00:44:47.971 --> 00:44:50.060
<v Speaker 2>arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll get further charge,</v>

908
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:52.790
<v Speaker 2>but I'm arrested and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I go to see Miss Lisa.</v>

909
00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:57.480
<v Speaker 2>The next day and I have a meeting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my solicitor about what's happening when</v>

910
00:44:57.481 --> 00:44:58.314
<v Speaker 2>they take me back after the meeting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they opened up a waiting room and as </v>

911
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:04.110
<v Speaker 2>soon as I look in the waiting room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see the big huge beard of a white,</v>

912
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:05.003
<v Speaker 2>a white convert on putting into the room</v>
<v Speaker 2>of about eight people in it and I'm </v>

913
00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.120
<v Speaker 2>violently attacked and the door's </v>
<v Speaker 2>locked.</v>

914
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.630
<v Speaker 2>The door was locked by the prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>officers,</v>

915
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.090
<v Speaker 2>the doors locked and I'm left to be bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Libyan and then not just that,</v>

916
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 2>but I was arrested again for fine.</v>

917
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:20.743
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just one experience in the </v>

918
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:24.120
<v Speaker 2>prison system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be honest.</v>

919
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:25.163
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky and I believe that people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling strings in order to have me </v>

920
00:45:27.601 --> 00:45:28.434
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I think even that they are </v>

921
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:30.624
<v Speaker 2>scratching their heads to how I walked </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and that's just one experience </v>

922
00:45:34.261 --> 00:45:35.280
<v Speaker 2>that's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time and time.</v>

923
00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Mind you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a day the other week in custody.</v>

924
00:45:38.461 --> 00:45:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was.</v>

925
00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:43.500
<v Speaker 2>This was quite recent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just probably six months ago.</v>

926
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:44.723
<v Speaker 2>I was coming to the end of my license </v>
<v Speaker 2>period with the authorities where they </v>

927
00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:48.114
<v Speaker 2>have you on a control order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't allowed to contact people who </v>

928
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.610
<v Speaker 2>are in the organization are used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to.</v>

929
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:55.080
<v Speaker 2>And this was for a mortgage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a so called mortgage for it.</v>

930
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who reads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reads,</v>

931
00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.600
<v Speaker 2>reads the story of what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see what it was all about.</v>

932
00:46:00.601 --> 00:46:01.434
<v Speaker 2>But I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was taken from the last eight days so </v>

933
00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:06.510
<v Speaker 2>it lost its or put back in prison.</v>

934
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:11.460
<v Speaker 2>I was taken to a prison called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterborough where I said at the stars,</v>

935
00:46:11.461 --> 00:46:14.250
<v Speaker 2>so there's got days left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dice,</v>

936
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

937
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:18.090
<v Speaker 2>just put me in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put me in isolation.</v>

938
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you don't open the door </v>
<v Speaker 2>for eight days.</v>

939
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:21.563
<v Speaker 2>The idea is let me go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come out with myself and I've </v>

940
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:25.320
<v Speaker 2>talked to prison officer again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

941
00:46:25.321 --> 00:46:26.760
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what's going to happen here.</v>

942
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.631
<v Speaker 2>And they've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

943
00:46:27.631 --> 00:46:28.464
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I prisoners come up to me what </v>

944
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:32.590
<v Speaker 2>an English prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

945
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:33.870
<v Speaker 2>he put his hand over his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

946
00:46:33.871 --> 00:46:36.630
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get done with Baltimore </v>
<v Speaker 2>now in prison,</v>

947
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.090
<v Speaker 2>in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put boiling water with sugar and it</v>

948
00:46:39.091 --> 00:46:40.620
<v Speaker 2>takes you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will take your face off.</v>

949
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.320
<v Speaker 2>So I'm looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got two minutes to think.</v>

950
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:45.210
<v Speaker 2>I said who's going to do it?</v>

951
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.313
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lag behind the door has put the </v>

952
00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:49.620
<v Speaker 2>money up because he'd paid money to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>me her.</v>

953
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:50.783
<v Speaker 2>Now the lag behind the standing next to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the door was doing 28 years in prison </v>

954
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.370
<v Speaker 2>for a murder where they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man's nose,</v>

955
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.331
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ears off,</v>

956
00:46:57.331 --> 00:46:58.164
<v Speaker 2>making odium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there was four of them in for that </v>

957
00:47:00.061 --> 00:47:01.950
<v Speaker 2>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in eight days.</v>

958
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:04.770
<v Speaker 2>I am known as someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has,</v>

959
00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:05.431
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

960
00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:07.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Al Shabaab have named me to be killed.</v>

961
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.393
<v Speaker 2>I've had six government ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>mornings sign that there is </v>

962
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.390
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be murdered by Muslims.</v>

963
00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:16.200
<v Speaker 2>And here I am doing eight days house </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Muslim murderers.</v>

964
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

965
00:47:19.231 --> 00:47:22.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my mind's going quick.</v>

966
00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.653
<v Speaker 2>I already know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've asked the principal far to </v>

967
00:47:24.631 --> 00:47:26.730
<v Speaker 2>segregate me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is no luck there.</v>

968
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.863
<v Speaker 2>I look across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I do what I had to do and before </v>

969
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:33.930
<v Speaker 2>he has a chance to turn around with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>comp,</v>

970
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:36.730
<v Speaker 2>I strike him and then and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison,</v>

971
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.060
<v Speaker 2>old older screws.</v>

972
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 2>The prison officers come and jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

973
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 2>I went before the prison governor for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that offense where I explain myself.</v>

974
00:47:44.381 --> 00:47:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

975
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.710
<v Speaker 2>you put me in this position where I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got.</v>

976
00:47:46.711 --> 00:47:50.050
<v Speaker 2>I have to defend myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They decided to take no further action.</v>

977
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:51.363
<v Speaker 2>I was then I was released from prison or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went on a holiday with my wife and </v>

978
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:55.624
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I landed back at home at Luton airport </v>

979
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 2>at midnight and the police were waiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

980
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 2>They arrested me in front of my kids and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they arrested me for the,</v>

981
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.900
<v Speaker 2>for attacking the Somalia and prisoner </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was going to do me a boy.</v>

982
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:07.783
<v Speaker 2>The more they then made a decision in </v>
<v Speaker 2>October last year to have no further </v>

983
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:13.360
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they said,</v>

984
00:48:13.361 --> 00:48:16.330
<v Speaker 2>we're not taking any further action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I then recently,</v>

985
00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:18.820
<v Speaker 2>just two weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I launched a Poquito UK,</v>

986
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:22.390
<v Speaker 2>which is a new organization to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>street demonstrations and two days later</v>

987
00:48:22.391 --> 00:48:23.224
<v Speaker 2>they come and they come and rearrested </v>
<v Speaker 2>me for the offense that they'd already </v>

988
00:48:25.181 --> 00:48:26.014
<v Speaker 2>dropped.</v>

989
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.980
<v Speaker 1>This is a lot of what your book is about</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's sort of this endless cycle that</v>

990
00:48:31.981 --> 00:48:33.930
<v Speaker 1>you've been part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

991
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:36.570
<v Speaker 1>and I know we could talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison stuff forever because you're just</v>

992
00:48:36.571 --> 00:48:37.404
<v Speaker 1>scratching the surface of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's talk about Paquita a little </v>

993
00:48:40.111 --> 00:48:40.944
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you just got back from </v>

994
00:48:41.701 --> 00:48:42.534
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were doing something with them in </v>

995
00:48:43.201 --> 00:48:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

996
00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:44.890
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

997
00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I'll just come back last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went to Copenhagen First,</v>

998
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:48.993
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I bought British journalist with </v>

999
00:48:50.131 --> 00:48:50.964
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we went to Copenhagen to sort of </v>

1000
00:48:52.531 --> 00:48:53.364
<v Speaker 2>launch Paquita in Denmark and to ask the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to stand with us on the sixth of </v>

1001
00:48:56.671 --> 00:48:57.504
<v Speaker 2>February because on the sixth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>February we're planning demonstrations </v>

1002
00:49:00.361 --> 00:49:01.194
<v Speaker 2>in 14 countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is the first time a coalition </v>

1003
00:49:04.861 --> 00:49:07.960
<v Speaker 2>like this has been formed and it's only </v>
<v Speaker 2>been made possible by the people,</v>

1004
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:08.843
<v Speaker 2>by the commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people have dressed and their </v>

1005
00:49:10.441 --> 00:49:12.420
<v Speaker 2>leadership have looked back mountain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other.</v>

1006
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.270
<v Speaker 2>The other is interesting because for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last year,</v>

1007
00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:16.643
<v Speaker 2>every single Monday for 52 weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have taken to the streets in their </v>

1008
00:49:20.971 --> 00:49:23.030
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1009
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the demonstration.</v>

1010
00:49:24.241 --> 00:49:26.910
<v Speaker 2>I just went through this Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was well over 10 to 15,000</v>

1011
00:49:26.911 --> 00:49:31.740
<v Speaker 2>people there in a completely peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and civilized manner to express their,</v>

1012
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:33.970
<v Speaker 2>their concern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free passive resistance.</v>

1013
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:34.804
<v Speaker 2>So what's happening?</v>

1014
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.590
<v Speaker 1>So just to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1015
00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:38.910
<v Speaker 1>when this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1016
00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.660
<v Speaker 1>this mass attack happened in Cologne </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a couple of weeks ago,</v>

1017
00:49:42.661 --> 00:49:44.150
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1018
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.380
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like the police were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1019
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.273
<v Speaker 1>People did not know who to turn to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A women were literally were being raped </v>

1020
00:49:50.761 --> 00:49:51.594
<v Speaker 1>and attacked and all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there were some demonstrations </v>

1021
00:49:53.611 --> 00:49:55.950
<v Speaker 1>a couple of days later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in Colona and some other cities.</v>

1022
00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:56.903
<v Speaker 1>And suddenly there were a lot of police </v>
<v Speaker 1>to police the people that were there to </v>

1023
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:04.410
<v Speaker 1>protest the violence that happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the women.</v>

1024
00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Something really backwards here.</v>

1025
00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there at that demonstration?</v>

1026
00:50:08.621 --> 00:50:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly what it is.</v>

1027
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:11.583
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get large disturbances of </v>

1028
00:50:13.631 --> 00:50:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the police do stairway.</v>

1029
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:18.190
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if they go in with their bands,</v>

1030
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.113
<v Speaker 2>if they go in and try and please the </v>
<v Speaker 2>streets provoke a riot and that riot </v>

1031
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:24.003
<v Speaker 2>will spread and they know that so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen that many times when we hang </v>

1032
00:50:28.101 --> 00:50:29.690
<v Speaker 2>up here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can send you a video after video,</v>

1033
00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:32.090
<v Speaker 2>which actually shows the police running </v>
<v Speaker 2>away in the UK.</v>

1034
00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Now they don't run away from us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knock your teeth out and knock your</v>

1035
00:50:35.621 --> 00:50:37.810
<v Speaker 2>head off before they run away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to,</v>

1036
00:50:37.811 --> 00:50:39.920
<v Speaker 2>they're told to police the communities </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

1037
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.843
<v Speaker 2>Now on New Year's Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head of the police actually asked </v>

1038
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.193
<v Speaker 2>his superiors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He asked for an extra hundred police </v>

1039
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:48.380
<v Speaker 2>officers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was refused.</v>

1040
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:50.083
<v Speaker 2>And then what we saw was these massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks and these mass rapes of of </v>

1041
00:50:53.331 --> 00:50:54.164
<v Speaker 2>German women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're right there no one to turn </v>

1042
00:50:55.461 --> 00:50:58.100
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And only traveled out there for the next</v>

1043
00:50:58.101 --> 00:50:59.900
<v Speaker 2>demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Lo and behold,</v>

1044
00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:00.734
<v Speaker 2>you've got thousands of police officers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got water cannons and I'm German </v>

1045
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:06.080
<v Speaker 2>people were attacked with water cannons </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the police.</v>

1046
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:07.743
<v Speaker 1>So is the situation in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly precarious even though you </v>

1047
00:51:10.511 --> 00:51:12.700
<v Speaker 1>mostly focused in the UK because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're from.</v>

1048
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.713
<v Speaker 1>I've heard a lot of people say that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany because of the guilt related to </v>

1049
00:51:17.021 --> 00:51:17.854
<v Speaker 1>the Holocaust that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel as a nation a certain amount </v>

1050
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:22.660
<v Speaker 1>of guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

1051
00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:26.290
<v Speaker 1>when these migrants and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people want to come there,</v>

1052
00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.290
<v Speaker 1>they feel an extra need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1053
00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:31.390
<v Speaker 1>to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

1054
00:51:31.391 --> 00:51:33.670
<v Speaker 1>that's why Merkel let in the whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1055
00:51:33.671 --> 00:51:34.504
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one point 2 million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that even when they do violent acts </v>

1056
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:39.573
<v Speaker 1>as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more condoning of it because </v>

1057
00:51:42.341 --> 00:51:45.730
<v Speaker 1>they know that their ancestors have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>some pretty horrible stuff.</v>

1058
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:47.103
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this generation of Germans seem to be </v>

1059
00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 2>living with and suffering from guilt </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Hitler.</v>

1060
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:55.860
<v Speaker 2>The next generation of Germans will </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffer and live with guilt from.</v>

1061
00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:00.880
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what I need to wake up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This generation.</v>

1062
00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Have nothing to feel guilty about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a beautiful country,</v>

1063
00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.040
<v Speaker 2>a beautiful culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the envy of the world,</v>

1064
00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:08.123
<v Speaker 2>and they're beautiful people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so civilized and decent people and they </v>

1065
00:52:12.261 --> 00:52:13.410
<v Speaker 2>have nothing to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also,</v>

1066
00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.580
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What this is is underestimation of,</v>

1067
00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.700
<v Speaker 2>of the culture and ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're allowing it.</v>

1068
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:23.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is like if everyone's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>make him humanity responses,</v>

1069
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:27.380
<v Speaker 2>we must help these people but not help </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1070
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:31.760
<v Speaker 2>If it involves the destruction of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and your and your country,</v>

1071
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:32.923
<v Speaker 2>not help them at the cost or the expense</v>
<v Speaker 2>of young German goes that and I'm all </v>

1072
00:52:37.311 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 2>for helping refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think they should be helped</v>

1073
00:52:39.321 --> 00:52:40.070
<v Speaker 2>in Europe.</v>

1074
00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I think they should be helped in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle East.</v>

1075
00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:42.493
<v Speaker 2>I think that we should be leading the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way in funding and military support to </v>

1076
00:52:44.811 --> 00:52:45.644
<v Speaker 2>make sure that there are buffer zones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they're important and </v>

1077
00:52:48.321 --> 00:52:51.160
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by important one point 2 million this,</v>

1078
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:52.023
<v Speaker 2>is she making any impact on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering of of refugees across the </v>

1079
00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Middle East because there's tens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions.</v>

1080
00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Whatever option is there bring bring the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole of Syria into Europe.</v>

1081
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.990
<v Speaker 2>It solves nothing is nothing and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's actually done by doing this,</v>

1082
00:53:05.991 --> 00:53:06.824
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's opened up the flood gates and we </v>

1083
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:08.504
<v Speaker 2>will now see absolute stampedes of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of millions over the next five </v>

1084
00:53:11.211 --> 00:53:11.500
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1085
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also read a bunch on how it's not </v>

1086
00:53:13.601 --> 00:53:18.160
<v Speaker 1>just about the violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also just the actual system,</v>

1087
00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:21.280
<v Speaker 1>the systems that are in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The social systems.</v>

1088
00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:22.114
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading something this morning </v>

1089
00:53:22.781 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 1>about how all of these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from Syria,</v>

1090
00:53:26.131 --> 00:53:26.880
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1091
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.950
<v Speaker 1>a huge percent of them have really bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>

1092
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:29.813
<v Speaker 1>Their teeth are really bad now they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get free dental coverage and </v>

1093
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:33.744
<v Speaker 1>it's going to cost something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sleep with something like a billion </v>

1094
00:53:35.431 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 1>euros or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to pay for it,</v>

1095
00:53:37.711 --> 00:53:39.880
<v Speaker 1>so the average German taxpayer is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have,</v>

1096
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.240
<v Speaker 1>have to pay for it and then that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1097
00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:43.074
<v Speaker 1>when their taxes go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then naturally they're going to be more </v>

1098
00:53:45.211 --> 00:53:46.630
<v Speaker 1>resentful of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1099
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.310
<v Speaker 1>it's hitting people in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the economic level and at the violent</v>

1100
00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:52.590
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like a terrible mix.</v>

1101
00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 1>A society.</v>

1102
00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:55.423
<v Speaker 2>It's going to hit them everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe 80 percent of them can't read </v>

1103
00:53:57.821 --> 00:53:58.654
<v Speaker 2>or write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe the many of the real refugees </v>

1104
00:54:01.631 --> 00:54:04.240
<v Speaker 2>that have come from Syria are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be suffering from PTSD,</v>

1105
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:06.430
<v Speaker 2>post traumatic stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress disorder.</v>

1106
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to need counseling.</v>

1107
00:54:08.141 --> 00:54:08.974
<v Speaker 2>They're going to need help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many problems that will come </v>

1108
00:54:11.351 --> 00:54:14.410
<v Speaker 2>from this and we say one point 2 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>

1109
00:54:14.411 --> 00:54:16.690
<v Speaker 2>but they were allowed to bring their </v>
<v Speaker 2>families after for years.</v>

1110
00:54:16.691 --> 00:54:17.524
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're loud and they're allowed </v>

1111
00:54:17.981 --> 00:54:21.220
<v Speaker 2>their EU passports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that one point two will become six or</v>

1112
00:54:21.221 --> 00:54:23.800
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have the infrastructure.</v>

1113
00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:24.993
<v Speaker 2>I'm simply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what Angela Merkel was fully aware </v>

1114
00:54:26.981 --> 00:54:27.814
<v Speaker 2>of is that they won't stay in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to come to countries like </v>

1115
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:30.940
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knows.</v>

1116
00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.350
<v Speaker 2>She knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

1117
00:54:32.351 --> 00:54:33.184
<v Speaker 2>just last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the German government have come out and </v>

1118
00:54:34.541 --> 00:54:38.260
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've lost 600,000</v>

1119
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.540
<v Speaker 2>refugee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've lost them asylum seekers.</v>

1120
00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:41.523
<v Speaker 2>We have lost them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not where they said they </v>

1121
00:54:42.131 --> 00:54:45.210
<v Speaker 2>weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got now 600,000.</v>

1122
00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:49.480
<v Speaker 2>How many of them are rapists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many Isis fighters?</v>

1123
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:52.330
<v Speaker 2>How many are criminals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea.</v>

1124
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.620
<v Speaker 2>No idea at all.</v>

1125
00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.050
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of this,</v>

1126
00:54:56.051 --> 00:54:56.884
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some level you hear the people </v>

1127
00:54:57.341 --> 00:54:58.174
<v Speaker 1>throwing around the term Trojan horse a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot and a lot of it sort of sounds like </v>

1128
00:55:01.841 --> 00:55:02.674
<v Speaker 1>a conspiracy that there has been this </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized effort to just influx all </v>

1129
00:55:06.581 --> 00:55:07.414
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I've seen even in some of </v>

1130
00:55:08.831 --> 00:55:09.664
<v Speaker 1>the videos that you've tweeted when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see just like hundreds or thousands of </v>

1131
00:55:13.151 --> 00:55:13.984
<v Speaker 1>migrants crossing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem like it's 80 or 90 percent </v>

1132
00:55:17.021 --> 00:55:17.854
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men that are 20 or 30 and you don't see </v>

1133
00:55:19.841 --> 00:55:20.674
<v Speaker 1>a lot of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see occasionally you'll see some </v>

1134
00:55:21.941 --> 00:55:24.190
<v Speaker 1>women in some children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does seem like a lot of men.</v>

1135
00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:28.150
<v Speaker 1>But to go that route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a conspiracy theory to go</v>

1136
00:55:28.151 --> 00:55:28.751
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1137
00:55:28.751 --> 00:55:29.584
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an intentional plan to flood </v>

1138
00:55:31.571 --> 00:55:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Europe with these people to ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>take over.</v>

1139
00:55:34.721 --> 00:55:37.450
<v Speaker 1>But I suspect by the 15 minutes we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent together,</v>

1140
00:55:37.451 --> 00:55:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't think it's much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy.</v>

1141
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:42.063
<v Speaker 2>That can be no other reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone with any common sense and </v>

1142
00:55:44.351 --> 00:55:45.184
<v Speaker 2>intelligence or brain can kind of look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at what's happening and know it's not </v>

1143
00:55:47.741 --> 00:55:48.574
<v Speaker 2>going to be good for Europe where anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>can look up what's happening to Angela </v>

1144
00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Merkel made comments such as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1145
00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:56.650
<v Speaker 2>immigrants are more prone to violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and extremism than the non immigrant.</v>

1146
00:55:56.651 --> 00:55:57.484
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said that years ago she's also made </v>

1147
00:55:58.601 --> 00:56:00.330
<v Speaker 2>comments saying that multiculturalism </v>
<v Speaker 2>has failed.</v>

1148
00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.520
<v Speaker 2>They've already failed in integrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of Muslims.</v>

1149
00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:08.850
<v Speaker 2>So why is she bringing in millions more?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What reason?</v>

1150
00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:11.830
<v Speaker 2>If anyone can else can give a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how are these millions?</v>

1151
00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:12.701
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

1152
00:56:12.701 --> 00:56:13.534
<v Speaker 1>What do you think actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is going on in her </v>

1153
00:56:14.981 --> 00:56:17.650
<v Speaker 1>head then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everything you've said here is true?</v>

1154
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Angola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merkel,</v>

1155
00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:20.020
<v Speaker 1>she was just time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woman of the year,</v>

1156
00:56:20.021 --> 00:56:20.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a,</v>

1157
00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.920
<v Speaker 1>this is a bright lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1158
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:23.813
<v Speaker 1>So what about</v>

1159
00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.153
<v Speaker 2>under Angela Merkel has no children that</v>
<v Speaker 2>she cares not for the future of our </v>

1160
00:56:28.241 --> 00:56:30.820
<v Speaker 2>country or our people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's truthfully what I feel.</v>

1161
00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:33.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she cares about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the future of her people.</v>

1162
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:35.950
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have this,</v>

1163
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.450
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

1164
00:56:37.451 --> 00:56:39.580
<v Speaker 2>people holding up on a pedestal at </v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

1165
00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 2>at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever it was for,</v>

1166
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:42.603
<v Speaker 2>I can't say it was through ill intention</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think they know that everyone </v>

1167
00:56:46.181 --> 00:56:47.014
<v Speaker 2>knows full well what this is going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Europe and we know full well what's </v>

1168
00:56:49.391 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 2>going to happen and what you're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually the only countries in Europe</v>

1169
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:53.403
<v Speaker 2>that are freely speaking honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the countries that don't have a I a </v>

1170
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.270
<v Speaker 2>high percentage of Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Poland,</v>

1171
00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:05.050
<v Speaker 2>it's hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Czech Republic,</v>

1172
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:05.963
<v Speaker 2>Slovakia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are political leaders are coming </v>

1173
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:08.104
<v Speaker 2>out and saying what needs to be said now</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the UK is former </v>

1174
00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:11.260
<v Speaker 2>political leaders.</v>

1175
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:14.650
<v Speaker 2>If you look at Sir William Gladstone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he held the Koran above his head.</v>

1176
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:15.903
<v Speaker 2>He in parliament and he said that Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this Koran is a violent and a </v>

1177
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:22.390
<v Speaker 2>curse book and we will never be have </v>
<v Speaker 2>peace on this earth.</v>

1178
00:57:22.391 --> 00:57:25.750
<v Speaker 2>So long as we have this book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Winston Churchill said,</v>

1179
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:28.900
<v Speaker 2>the individual Muslims will show amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics,</v>

1180
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:30.003
<v Speaker 2>but the backwardness of Islam has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>power to bring Europe back to the dark </v>

1181
00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:34.810
<v Speaker 2>ages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there are two world leaders,</v>

1182
00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:36.970
<v Speaker 2>we have statues that the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 2>loved,</v>

1183
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:38.283
<v Speaker 2>and if they were around today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will be called bigots and </v>

1184
00:57:40.421 --> 00:57:43.240
<v Speaker 2>extremists and that simply for telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>

1185
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:45.520
<v Speaker 2>my prime minister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prime minister,</v>

1186
00:57:45.521 --> 00:57:46.354
<v Speaker 2>says that Islam is a religion of peace </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the facts speak very different to </v>

1187
00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:53.350
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the moment the problem we have is</v>

1188
00:57:53.351 --> 00:57:54.184
<v Speaker 2>that by telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which even if people don't like the </v>

1189
00:57:57.851 --> 00:57:59.800
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to be honest.</v>

1190
00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1191
00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:01.573
<v Speaker 1>so think when people say Islam is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion of peace or Christianity's </v>

1192
00:58:03.591 --> 00:58:05.900
<v Speaker 1>originally piece or Judaism is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion of peace,</v>

1193
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:07.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a moot point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1194
00:58:07.131 --> 00:58:09.740
<v Speaker 1>religion is because of religion is only </v>
<v Speaker 1>a set of ideas.</v>

1195
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:13.250
<v Speaker 1>All the religion is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what it's adherence do,</v>

1196
00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:16.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a religion of peace that that means</v>

1197
00:58:16.071 --> 00:58:18.860
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That an idea is what people do with it.</v>

1198
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.963
<v Speaker 1>So I find those statements like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't add anything to the </v>

1199
00:58:22.281 --> 00:58:23.114
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

1200
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:24.773
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we hear them after every terrorist </v>

1201
00:58:25.881 --> 00:58:27.570
<v Speaker 2>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single terrorist.</v>

1202
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:28.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we,</v>

1203
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.120
<v Speaker 2>that's what we talked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

1204
00:58:30.121 --> 00:58:32.370
<v Speaker 2>it's not what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it to other circumstances.</v>

1205
00:58:32.371 --> 00:58:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Now as a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as that,</v>

1206
00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:35.453
<v Speaker 2>I was studying the biography of Mohammed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sat at home and I'm preparing </v>

1207
00:58:39.661 --> 00:58:43.260
<v Speaker 2>for a debate and my daughter who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years old,</v>

1208
00:58:43.261 --> 00:58:45.220
<v Speaker 2>she walked past me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

1209
00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never taught my children.</v>

1210
00:58:47.191 --> 00:58:50.010
<v Speaker 2>They think my kids never heard of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>English Defense League.</v>

1211
00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived two very separate lives and I,</v>

1212
00:58:53.041 --> 00:58:53.874
<v Speaker 2>I want to protect them for as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible from understanding these </v>

1213
00:58:55.861 --> 00:58:57.990
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daughter walked past and said,</v>

1214
00:58:57.991 --> 00:58:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peace be upon him.</v>

1215
00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:01.283
<v Speaker 2>And I looked and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you just say and why did you </v>

1216
00:59:03.901 --> 00:59:05.460
<v Speaker 2>just say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

1217
00:59:05.461 --> 00:59:06.151
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's taught at school.</v>

1218
00:59:06.151 --> 00:59:07.230
<v Speaker 2>You have to say peace be upon him.</v>

1219
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Said peace be upon him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1220
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:14.460
<v Speaker 2>and that was one incident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then another incident about a mosque.</v>

1221
00:59:14.461 --> 00:59:17.070
<v Speaker 2>And then when I took my children to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at another school,</v>

1222
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that,</v>

1223
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:20.183
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they had to do was put</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different religious buildings with </v>

1224
00:59:22.611 --> 00:59:24.050
<v Speaker 2>the different religious words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:29.330
<v Speaker 2>The only one my daughter could do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions of the world was his mom.</v>

1226
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:30.913
<v Speaker 2>Because what's happening now in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>national curriculum in the UK is that </v>

1227
00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:34.634
<v Speaker 2>Islam is the favorite religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam is what's being pushed and </v>

1228
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:37.703
<v Speaker 2>propagates all of our youth and children</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're brainwashing either mind if </v>

1229
00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:43.280
<v Speaker 2>they want to talk about Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell the truth,</v>

1230
00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.370
<v Speaker 2>tell us about the man or he was not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man of peace.</v>

1231
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Some of the things he'd done with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>such immoral thing.</v>

1232
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:50.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he killed a lot of people.</v>

1233
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>

1234
00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not teaching that.</v>

1235
00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:56.410
<v Speaker 2>They're teaching this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is great man.</v>

1236
00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.910
<v Speaker 2>This great man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed,</v>

1237
00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.100
<v Speaker 2>that we must all respect and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peace be upon him.</v>

1238
01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight year old English go children.</v>

1239
01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.710
<v Speaker 2>So then by the time that next generation</v>
<v Speaker 2>come out at the schools,</v>

1240
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:10.210
<v Speaker 2>there been brainwashed into this mindset</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as your parents even.</v>

1241
01:00:10.211 --> 01:00:11.044
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it across the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents who have not wanted their </v>

1242
01:00:13.121 --> 01:00:16.090
<v Speaker 2>children to be taught these things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then branded as racist as well.</v>

1243
01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I moved for the truth being taught to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

1244
01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:19.443
<v Speaker 2>but then I haven't even spoke to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>children if I haven't spoke to our </v>

1245
01:00:23.051 --> 01:00:23.884
<v Speaker 2>children about Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are All one school talking to him about </v>

1246
01:00:26.491 --> 01:00:26.740
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1247
01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the strange things and I </v>

1248
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:31.450
<v Speaker 1>think we see this a little bit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America where they'll say,</v>

1249
01:00:31.451 --> 01:00:32.284
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to learn more about Islam </v>

1250
01:00:33.521 --> 01:00:34.354
<v Speaker 1>because of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me it's like we should not be </v>

1251
01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:37.384
<v Speaker 1>learning more about Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should not be learning more about </v>

1252
01:00:38.831 --> 01:00:39.664
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should not be learning more about </v>

1253
01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Judaism or mormonism or jainism or any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

1254
01:00:43.451 --> 01:00:46.420
<v Speaker 1>What we should be learning about our </v>
<v Speaker 1>secular values.</v>

1255
01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>We should be learning about the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tie us together.</v>

1256
01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Not all the little differences that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just gonna split us.</v>

1257
01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.350
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm completely in agreement.</v>

1258
01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:56.184
<v Speaker 2>It's just a fundamental problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say that I believe in secular </v>

1259
01:00:59.311 --> 01:01:00.870
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should have secular schools,</v>

1260
01:01:00.871 --> 01:01:02.550
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe we should also,</v>

1261
01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:05.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that shouldn't pose,</v>

1262
01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:09.810
<v Speaker 2>pose a problem for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for safe schools or schools or Christian</v>

1263
01:01:09.811 --> 01:01:12.810
<v Speaker 2>schools because because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>causing us the problems that we face.</v>

1264
01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:15.810
<v Speaker 2>These huge problems that we face </v>
<v Speaker 2>currently are caused by Islam.</v>

1265
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.673
<v Speaker 2>They're inspired by Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they want to sit in schools and </v>

1266
01:01:18.901 --> 01:01:20.620
<v Speaker 2>talk about Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to tell them that he,</v>

1267
01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:21.870
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he raped a child,</v>

1268
01:01:21.871 --> 01:01:23.970
<v Speaker 2>he married a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he committed murder,</v>

1269
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:26.100
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't need to tell the truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not.</v>

1270
01:01:26.101 --> 01:01:26.934
<v Speaker 2>So then we have this complete ward down </v>
<v Speaker 2>educational system that is lying to the </v>

1271
01:01:29.821 --> 01:01:31.200
<v Speaker 2>next generation of youth in the UK.</v>

1272
01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1273
01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.533
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we have to wrap up and I feel like </v>

1274
01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.673
<v Speaker 1>there's so much more we could talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully with the way I prefaced </v>

1275
01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:42.580
<v Speaker 1>this whole episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will learn about you and they can</v>

1276
01:01:42.581 --> 01:01:44.290
<v Speaker 1>make the decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1277
01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:45.183
<v Speaker 1>whether they think you're a racist or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they think you're preaching the </v>

1278
01:01:48.851 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>truth or somewhere in between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1279
01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:52.250
<v Speaker 1>but just to wrap up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1280
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:56.800
<v Speaker 1>give me something that you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me some hope here.</v>

1281
01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Give me some hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1282
01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:58.714
<v Speaker 1>you're working with piggy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound like a hate </v>

1283
01:02:00.941 --> 01:02:01.774
<v Speaker 1>organization to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So give me some hope for an ability to </v>

1284
01:02:04.631 --> 01:02:07.210
<v Speaker 1>turn some of this around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And first and coexistence</v>

<v Speaker 2>people of Europe.</v>
