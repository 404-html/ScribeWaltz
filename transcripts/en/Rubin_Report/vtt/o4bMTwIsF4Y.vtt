00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.503
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today as a biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a former professor at evergreen state </v>

2
00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:13.090
<v Speaker 1>who is now a professor in exile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bret Weinstein.</v>

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me back on.</v>

4
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Professor in exile a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it says on your twitter bio,</v>

5
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:22.910
<v Speaker 1>which means it's your most defining </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic right now.</v>

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 1>That has become the tenor of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

7
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>so I went into the Rubin report </v>
<v Speaker 1>archives.</v>

8
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.840
<v Speaker 1>They're very much like the Jedi </v>
<v Speaker 1>archives.</v>

9
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.683
<v Speaker 1>I went into the Rubin Report Archives </v>
<v Speaker 1>this morning that you were on this show </v>

10
00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>originally on May 30th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>

11
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:39.764
<v Speaker 1>So that's about a year and a half ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just as the Evergreen Brouhaha </v>

12
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>was beginning you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still were employed at the time,</v>

13
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which probably seems like a lifetime </v>

14
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:52.910
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:53.744
<v Speaker 1>so I think first maybe we should just </v>
<v Speaker 1>play a little catch up from that and I </v>

16
00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>just to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had been on the show one since then.</v>

17
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:00.374
<v Speaker 1>You were on with your brother Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we did a little bit about evergreen </v>

18
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:03.800
<v Speaker 1>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw,</v>

19
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I thought first let's do to catch up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened,</v>

20
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>where you're at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going,</v>

21
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.710
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to do sort of new </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory and we're going to cover a lot</v>

22
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 1>of biology and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

23
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 2>So May 30th of 2017 would be exactly one</v>
<v Speaker 2>week into the riots.</v>

24
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 2>The protests that my classroom that </v>
<v Speaker 2>became relatively famous happened on May</v>

25
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 2>23rd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one weekend and I was sitting in this</v>

26
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:30.654
<v Speaker 2>chair</v>

27
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>and that feels like a lifetime ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

28
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean it feels like it for me and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think less has happened to me,</v>

29
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>although it's been a pretty busy year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half.</v>

30
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.043
<v Speaker 2>The transformation of my life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>heather's life in that period has been </v>

31
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 2>so dramatic that it's hard to even </v>
<v Speaker 2>relate.</v>

32
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I've never had so much happen in a year.</v>

33
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

34
00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:51.784
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for people that don't know anything </v>

35
00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:53.914
<v Speaker 1>about the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suspect there's very few watching </v>

36
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:55.984
<v Speaker 1>this at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you give me like the 92nd recap of </v>

37
00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can that be done in 90 seconds?</v>

38
00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

39
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.033
<v Speaker 2>It can be done with with carnage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must say I feared this question more </v>

40
00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:08.710
<v Speaker 2>than any other because there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>detail in the story.</v>

41
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 2>It can't be covered properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

42
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.373
<v Speaker 2>give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give a cliff notes version that </v>

43
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an explainer,</v>

44
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.873
<v Speaker 2>equity and inclusion movement got </v>
<v Speaker 2>started on my campus as it is on </v>

45
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:25.501
<v Speaker 2>virtually every campus and the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of Evergreen threw fuel on the</v>

46
00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:27.094
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used the division over that issue to </v>

47
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:32.740
<v Speaker 2>accomplish things he could not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished otherwise.</v>

48
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.143
<v Speaker 2>I tried to block his moves to dismantle </v>
<v Speaker 2>the excellent part of Evergreen's </v>

49
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.473
<v Speaker 2>teaching model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which heather and I were using the full </v>

50
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:42.964
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I became effectively enemy number </v>

51
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 2>one of this equity and inclusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

52
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 2>They arranged a protest at my classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dramatic.</v>

53
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 2>50 students showed up demanding my </v>
<v Speaker 2>resignation.</v>

54
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:58.600
<v Speaker 2>Not a single one of them was a student I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had ever encountered.</v>

55
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in any case,</v>

56
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 2>they made a terrible error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They filmed their confrontation with me,</v>

57
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.813
<v Speaker 2>they uploaded it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now know to facebook somebody else in </v>

58
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 2>the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

59
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.243
<v Speaker 2>picked those videos up and broadcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and the world watched me try to </v>

60
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 2>reason with them and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.303
<v Speaker 2>that set things in motion where </v>
<v Speaker 2>evergreen started using me as an excuse </v>

62
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 2>for its problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It blamed me for what happened there for</v>

63
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 2>the dropoff in enrollment for all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>

64
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started engaging with the public about</v>

65
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.280
<v Speaker 2>what was taking place at Evergreen about</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues of freedom of expression and free</v>

66
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>inquiry on college campuses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly a evolutionary biology,</v>

67
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>people did not initially really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that.</v>

69
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 2>That was the focus that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a freedom of speech issues.</v>

70
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Now increasingly that's what people want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk to me about,</v>

71
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 2>although we're going to get to plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because I know that's what you're,</v>

72
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 2>your real focus and passion is.</v>

73
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's sort of funny that now you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been thrust into this.</v>

74
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.203
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in effect you were protesting </v>

75
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 2>putting racist policies on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that fair to say?</v>

76
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is one of the,</v>

77
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardest lessons for people to learn.</v>

78
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.243
<v Speaker 2>People good people get the idea that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can spot the right side by certain </v>

79
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.813
<v Speaker 2>heuristics and you know there's been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical fact of oppressed people </v>

80
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 2>tending to be people of color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

81
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 2>and so people have gotten lazy about </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing who's in the right.</v>

82
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Speaker 2>If you follow a principal to its logical</v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions.</v>

83
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're against segregation,</v>

84
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I am,</v>

85
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.993
<v Speaker 2>then when the segregationists are </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling white people to leave campus or </v>

86
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:58.234
<v Speaker 2>asking them to leave campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you are committed to standing </v>

87
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:02.644
<v Speaker 2>against segregation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you do stand against </v>

88
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:05.044
<v Speaker 2>segregation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world goes crazy because people who </v>

89
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:07.924
<v Speaker 2>are being lazy about recognizing which </v>
<v Speaker 2>side is defending the principle that </v>

90
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they subscribe to a,</v>

91
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 2>they fall out in the wrong place.</v>

92
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.273
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes it is your principles and adherence </v>

93
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:22.370
<v Speaker 2>to them that gets you in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.283
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you then show up in this studio a </v>

95
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 2>week after this whole thing goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was your first public interview about</v>

96
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 2>any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you think at the time was going</v>

97
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:37.680
<v Speaker 2>to happen by talking about this publicly</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

98
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 2>or what was your hope at least by </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this publicly?</v>

99
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:44.074
<v Speaker 2>initially my hope was to expose the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foolishness at evergreen and save the </v>

101
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:53.584
<v Speaker 2>college from its own worst instincts </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your audience may not care </v>

102
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 2>terribly deeply about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for a small number of people,</v>

103
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 2>for 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>students at a time,</v>

104
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.803
<v Speaker 2>Evergreen was actually a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment in which it was possible for </v>

105
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:13.620
<v Speaker 2>people who hadn't had tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

106
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.473
<v Speaker 2>educational advantages before they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to college to have an experience that </v>

107
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.913
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be reproduced anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evergreens model was so unique that if </v>

108
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 2>you ended up in the right classrooms </v>
<v Speaker 2>with professors who really cared,</v>

109
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.520
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like no other place and,</v>

110
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 2>and you were given incredible</v>

111
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.480
<v Speaker 1>a freedom as a professor to do what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want it with these kids.</v>

112
00:06:33.481 --> 00:06:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

113
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.673
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the position that heather</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had was the freest academic </v>

114
00:06:39.751 --> 00:06:43.800
<v Speaker 2>position in the country and maybe on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

115
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.693
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really more freedom than a </v>

116
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.310
<v Speaker 2>tenured professor at Harvard has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

117
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.203
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was both a blessing and a curse if </v>

118
00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:56.160
<v Speaker 2>you decided to use that freedom for </v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

119
00:06:56.161 --> 00:06:56.994
<v Speaker 2>if you decided to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovate structures that didn't exist </v>

120
00:06:59.341 --> 00:07:00.174
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do it and nobody could tell </v>

121
00:07:01.711 --> 00:07:03.150
<v Speaker 2>you not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

122
00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:07.530
<v Speaker 2>if you decided to take the rest of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>career off and you know,</v>

123
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.150
<v Speaker 2>teach with one hand while you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.480
<v Speaker 2>dealt with your hobbies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could also get away with murder.</v>

125
00:07:12.481 --> 00:07:15.150
<v Speaker 2>And so that happened as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

126
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.043
<v Speaker 2>there was attention every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every good professor at evergreen </v>

127
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.810
<v Speaker 2>grumbles about the fact that there are a</v>
<v Speaker 2>large number of people who,</v>

128
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.003
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are holding positions there that they </v>

129
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.310
<v Speaker 2>don't really value.</v>

130
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.261
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

131
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:31.470
<v Speaker 2>the phrase that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we typically used in private on the</v>

132
00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:34.020
<v Speaker 2>faculty was that Evergreen paid in </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom,</v>

133
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.270
<v Speaker 2>which meant that it didn't pay well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a good paying job,</v>

134
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.100
<v Speaker 2>but the ability to have a blank canvas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and decide how you were,</v>

135
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.140
<v Speaker 2>what you wanted to teach and in what </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

136
00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:50.910
<v Speaker 2>and to innovate new mechanisms and take </v>
<v Speaker 2>students off campus for a week or two or</v>

137
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:51.744
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that freedom was a very valuable </v>

138
00:07:56.281 --> 00:07:57.114
<v Speaker 2>commodity that evergreen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undervalued the whole time it should </v>

139
00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:00.324
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should have leveled with people that </v>

140
00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 2>it was hiring and it should have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

141
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.490
<v Speaker 2>this job is not going to make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy,</v>

142
00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:06.324
<v Speaker 2>but it can make you very happy if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the temperament that really wants </v>

143
00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:09.450
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what's possible.</v>

144
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.813
<v Speaker 1>So as this was unfolding and now you </v>
<v Speaker 1>went public and you also did Rogan and </v>

145
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 1>you were on Tucker Carlson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you said,</v>

146
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:17.534
<v Speaker 1>I'm deeply progressive because suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were sort of getting crap from your </v>

147
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

148
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>and you were getting embraced by perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different side.</v>

149
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 1>And I do want to get a little more into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that now because it shows what a sort of</v>

150
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 1>crazy realignment politically we've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>

151
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you shocked how deep it went?</v>

152
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.370
<v Speaker 1>So you went public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

153
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:39.830
<v Speaker 1>you were giving the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were exposing sort of the corruption</v>

154
00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 1>and how it went all the way up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration and all that.</v>

155
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I think from that first interview we </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

156
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I think you thought that there would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a course correction in here,</v>

157
00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:52.310
<v Speaker 1>or at least there was a chance for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>course correction and at least the way I</v>

158
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:53.144
<v Speaker 1>read the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at no point was there even a slow down </v>

159
00:08:57.001 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>or any reflection from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration and the rest of it,</v>

160
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>they just went in on this.</v>

161
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.503
<v Speaker 2>I am completely shocked by the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world's recognition of just how </v>

162
00:09:09.831 --> 00:09:10.664
<v Speaker 2>awful things were at evergreen did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>force an acknowledgement that something </v>

163
00:09:14.331 --> 00:09:15.164
<v Speaker 2>was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would not have been surprised if </v>

164
00:09:18.051 --> 00:09:22.880
<v Speaker 2>evergreen had backed off cynically if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had privately said,</v>

165
00:09:22.881 --> 00:09:26.180
<v Speaker 2>actually we were on the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were misportrayed and.</v>

166
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.780
<v Speaker 2>But we nonetheless have to acknowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the world is saying to us.</v>

167
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.123
<v Speaker 2>The fact that that did not happen at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>still shocks me and I can't explain it </v>

168
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.820
<v Speaker 2>because you have a president who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>widely understood to be a.</v>

169
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.400
<v Speaker 2>is there a polite word for bond?</v>

170
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.363
<v Speaker 1>He's bonkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is one of my favorite words like </v>

171
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.250
<v Speaker 1>bananas too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bonkers,</v>

172
00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wackadoodle too young.</v>

173
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.510
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a president who was,</v>

174
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.263
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

175
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.610
<v Speaker 2>he's the mad king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

176
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.790
<v Speaker 2>He's the mad king and you've got a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people standing around.</v>

177
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm accepting his authority when in fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an outsider,</v>

178
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 2>is understanding of the college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

179
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.563
<v Speaker 2>or his plans for the college are </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely inconsistent with the values </v>

180
00:10:13.061 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 2>that the college was founded on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

181
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 1>And were they really accepting his </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority actually,</v>

182
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:17.934
<v Speaker 1>because there are moments in the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this that these videos are posted </v>

183
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:22.080
<v Speaker 1>where he can't even leave to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathroom.</v>

184
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>And he was also a hostage in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his own,</v>

185
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe his own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like perverted a dream or something.</v>

186
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

187
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both puppet and puppeteer.</v>

188
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.333
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

189
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.810
<v Speaker 1>and so the thing is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is held hostage in those things,</v>

190
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 1>but I believe he's a willing hostage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense that he's trying to accomplish</v>

191
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 1>something and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

192
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.103
<v Speaker 1>it tells the whole tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you say what we are doing is about </v>

193
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:50.843
<v Speaker 1>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a whole swath of people that </v>

194
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.300
<v Speaker 1>cannot figure out how they would object </v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what it is that you say next,</v>

195
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.233
<v Speaker 1>no matter what your plan is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've said that it is for the </v>

196
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:01.764
<v Speaker 1>purpose of racial equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a whole section of the population </v>

197
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:09.750
<v Speaker 1>will just fall in lockstep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

198
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 1>What is that psychologically do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think?</v>

199
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know because I think we're seeing this</v>

200
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:14.304
<v Speaker 1>everywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not just something that's </v>

201
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:18.240
<v Speaker 1>happening at universities anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is happening all over society.</v>

202
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.163
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could</v>

203
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:24.390
<v Speaker 2>say that it is an error in cognition </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are seeing it incorrectly.</v>

204
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.273
<v Speaker 2>What I know for sure now as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody on earth is that the part of </v>

205
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:36.720
<v Speaker 2>people's minds that drives them in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction of silence,</v>

206
00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:37.554
<v Speaker 2>of self editing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all of these things is actually </v>

207
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 2>accurately perceiving a threat that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot manage.</v>

208
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.793
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not looking for sympathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not have my job anymore and I miss </v>

209
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a great.</v>

210
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.020
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've landed on my feet.</v>

211
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.093
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't trade my position for any </v>

212
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like where I am.</v>

213
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

214
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 2>there's not an infinite number of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions in the world,</v>

215
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.333
<v Speaker 2>so most people who are looking at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of an equity and inclusion </v>

216
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.983
<v Speaker 2>juggernaut who are thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I stand up actually have to ask </v>

217
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.484
<v Speaker 2>themselves what happens if I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I have an economic plan B for my </v>

218
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:21.760
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

219
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who doesn't have an economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>plan,</v>

220
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:24.874
<v Speaker 2>B for their family and I have to say as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as I would like evergreen to be a </v>

221
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:29.044
<v Speaker 2>place in which all the faculty had </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough skills that they could go do </v>

222
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:32.320
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they have to,</v>

223
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.293
<v Speaker 2>they don't write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't easily move to another </v>

224
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.160
<v Speaker 2>college because the way they teach at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Evergreen doesn't,</v>

225
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.213
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a CV that will get you hired </v>

226
00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:43.370
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

227
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:48.220
<v Speaker 2>and so I think lots of people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking ahead and saying,</v>

228
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:50.560
<v Speaker 2>if I stand up and I say the right thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

229
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will,</v>

230
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.740
<v Speaker 2>what will become of me and the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place where I,</v>

231
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:57.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have sympathy for anybody who sees </v>

232
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:01.600
<v Speaker 2>that and so I don't have a plan B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do,</v>

233
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:02.853
<v Speaker 2>where I lose sympathy with them is when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they then having made that calculation </v>

234
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 2>rationalize what they are saying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they join,</v>

235
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 2>not reluctantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they become enthusiastic</v>

236
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.710
<v Speaker 1>allies of this movement in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

237
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.690
<v Speaker 1>basically they sell the rest of us out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

238
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:21.683
<v Speaker 1>And in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost have to do that </v>

239
00:13:23.341 --> 00:13:25.470
<v Speaker 1>psychologically to live with themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

240
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you realize that then you are </v>

241
00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:31.260
<v Speaker 1>a sellout in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:31.860
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

243
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.480
<v Speaker 1>it's harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>

244
00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:34.470
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm so fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

245
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm so fascinated with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because as you know,</v>

246
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.093
<v Speaker 1>I've been on tour with Peterson for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last couple months and I think this is </v>

247
00:13:41.611 --> 00:13:44.070
<v Speaker 1>the number one question that we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked.</v>

248
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.690
<v Speaker 1>People want to speak up and they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of losing their jobs and,</v>

249
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.613
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's why your story </v>
<v Speaker 1>resonated with so many people because </v>

250
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.580
<v Speaker 1>people were looking at you and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

251
00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:55.830
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty freaking obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy is not a racist.</v>

252
00:13:55.831 --> 00:13:56.664
<v Speaker 1>He's not a hater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a self identified left knee and a </v>

253
00:13:58.621 --> 00:13:59.454
<v Speaker 1>progressive and all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somehow he stood up to the monster </v>

254
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:05.070
<v Speaker 1>and I think the fact that you're still </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and you're,</v>

255
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not employed at the moment.</v>

256
00:14:07.111 --> 00:14:09.090
<v Speaker 1>And now I do want to discuss that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit too.</v>

257
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.920
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that you're still here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're alive.</v>

258
00:14:10.921 --> 00:14:12.750
<v Speaker 1>You're still willing to talk about these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

259
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the type of courage that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are looking for at the moment.</v>

260
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.183
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

261
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

262
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 2>So I have to say for a year now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

263
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.360
<v Speaker 2>I have had these interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

264
00:14:26.361 --> 00:14:30.560
<v Speaker 2>a couple times a day somebody will come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to me on the street and unless I'm in</v>

265
00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Olympia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always nice.</v>

266
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.313
<v Speaker 2>People have people,</v>

267
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.710
<v Speaker 1>even sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beard,</v>

268
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.340
<v Speaker 1>they're still coming up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually that has reduced it.</v>

269
00:14:38.341 --> 00:14:39.174
<v Speaker 1>I think we're not quite sure there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that who I think it is or is that </v>

270
00:14:42.521 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Eric or is it presented?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

271
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.450
<v Speaker 1>But you go buzz cut and then your </v>
<v Speaker 1>scottfree then.</v>

272
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be,</v>

273
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go on the Lam.</v>

274
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:50.790
<v Speaker 1>They've never find me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

275
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

276
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.130
<v Speaker 2>the thing is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it raises questions.</v>

277
00:14:57.331 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 2>The stuff that people say to me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they see on the outside,</v>

278
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:00.914
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to compare that to what the </v>

279
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 2>experience was on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've done a lot of thinking about</v>

280
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:06.630
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

281
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there some reason that,</v>

282
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 2>that I stood up when others didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

283
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes down to something simple,</v>

284
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.230
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

285
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just put it out there.</v>

286
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.053
<v Speaker 2>I think people are rationalizing their </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptance of this nonsense movement in </v>

287
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:31.301
<v Speaker 2>order to sleep and for some reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular switch works the opposite way</v>

288
00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:32.444
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I heard myself rationalizing that I </v>

289
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:35.714
<v Speaker 2>would not be able to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in order to sleep I had to stand up </v>

290
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.180
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

291
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.003
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky I have really good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a wonderful brother who was </v>

292
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 2>friends with you and that put us in </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact and uh,</v>

293
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I have something else to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

294
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary biology is fascinating to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

295
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.770
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how to think about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

296
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as my students where they're very </v>

297
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:03.950
<v Speaker 2>interested to hear what I have to say on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the subject.</v>

298
00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:08.120
<v Speaker 2>So that means somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I couldn't see it exactly on</v>

299
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:12.470
<v Speaker 2>May 23rd of 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a path forward for me,</v>

300
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.910
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.290
<v Speaker 2>it could come crashing down tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so far it looks good.</v>

302
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.490
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

303
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.350
<v Speaker 2>I regret nothing.</v>

304
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.393
<v Speaker 1>Is there an evolutionary explanation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that type of person that either can </v>

305
00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:31.610
<v Speaker 1>sleep or cannot sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

306
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 1>people come up to all of us all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and they say,</v>

307
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could speak up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lose my job.</v>

308
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.290
<v Speaker 1>My wife's pissed at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of these things.</v>

309
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:40.124
<v Speaker 1>And they're literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'm talking to people one on </v>

310
00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:42.170
<v Speaker 1>one and they're whispering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

311
00:16:42.171 --> 00:16:43.060
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

312
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.520
<v Speaker 1>this layer of fear is seriously real and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is sitting on top of people.</v>

313
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:50.504
<v Speaker 1>So is there an evolutionary explanation </v>
<v Speaker 1>why at the moment it seemed like a very </v>

314
00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:57.890
<v Speaker 1>small amount of people are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

315
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just quickly,</v>

316
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I would just say for me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's about sleeping,</v>

317
00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like I'm doing what's right.</v>

318
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.610
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually not more,</v>

319
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

320
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not more a confusing or needs more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an explanation</v>

321
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.570
<v Speaker 2>that that's just what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

322
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:17.583
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are two things to say on this </v>

323
00:17:19.691 --> 00:17:20.740
<v Speaker 2>front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One.</v>

324
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:26.080
<v Speaker 2>So I know we're going to talk more about</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary theory later on,</v>

325
00:17:26.081 --> 00:17:26.914
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a way in which evolutionary </v>

326
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:33.931
<v Speaker 2>theory stalled 30 years ago and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that the explanation that you're</v>

327
00:17:36.251 --> 00:17:39.820
<v Speaker 2>looking for is on the table in the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know.</v>

328
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Any evolutionists that you asked would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

329
00:17:41.591 --> 00:17:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the explanation is over here,</v>

330
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.133
<v Speaker 2>but I do believe we can see what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of adaptations that do </v>

331
00:17:48.161 --> 00:17:48.994
<v Speaker 2>not map well onto the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the individual and you </v>

332
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.940
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

333
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.133
<v Speaker 2>why would the person behave this way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems paradoxical sometimes if you </v>

334
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 2>look at something larger than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual and it's not the group.</v>

335
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been caught in this argument about</v>

336
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:08.970
<v Speaker 2>group selection since the sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually even earlier,</v>

337
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 2>but that's where it began to come to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

338
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.733
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the lineage that is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say a population of people who are </v>

339
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:24.050
<v Speaker 2>related now talking about ancestral </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestral population,</v>

340
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:30.320
<v Speaker 2>there are many characteristics that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>value for the lineage moving forward,</v>

341
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 2>that are hard to understand from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view of the individual and many</v>

342
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 2>of the things that we have a really hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>time explaining,</v>

343
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:40.890
<v Speaker 2>including things like homosexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

344
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of these things are adaptations </v>

345
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:49.140
<v Speaker 2>that exist at that slightly higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

346
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.260
<v Speaker 2>And so what I would say is an individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can't sleep if they're not doing the</v>

347
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:55.224
<v Speaker 2>right thing or if they hear themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationalizing that individual is not </v>

348
00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:02.780
<v Speaker 2>well suited to certain jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

349
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.860
<v Speaker 2>but they're very well suited to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

350
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.570
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that a population has an </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergent nature and that,</v>

351
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a division of labor between,</v>

352
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling you that not </v>

353
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 2>rationalizing is the way we should all </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

354
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.533
<v Speaker 2>It may well be that we need certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are very good at carefully </v>

355
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:25.230
<v Speaker 2>rationalizing certain things in order to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get jobs done.</v>

356
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.183
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine if you are in the </v>

357
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:29.484
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are in a position of command in </v>

358
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:32.484
<v Speaker 2>the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are certain things that you </v>

359
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:36.870
<v Speaker 2>have to rationalize in order to win the </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

360
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I don't like war.</v>

361
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that every word should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

362
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.620
<v Speaker 2>You know you shouldn't enter into a war </v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't justified,</v>

363
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.160
<v Speaker 2>but once you've entered into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goal is justified.</v>

364
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you have to rationalize certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

365
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:55.974
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you move troops over here in order to </v>

366
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.600
<v Speaker 2>protect something over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

367
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:01.434
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing to these people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may be sending them to their deaths </v>

368
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:03.924
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even talking about it makes makes me </v>

369
00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:09.480
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable because it's not something</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be good at,</v>

370
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.673
<v Speaker 2>but the point is when you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population and the fact is the </v>

371
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Speaker 2>populations that we have a live on earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>today are all winners,</v>

372
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

373
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 2>These are the winners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Irrespective of how you got here,</v>

374
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:27.080
<v Speaker 2>irrespective of how oppressed your </v>
<v Speaker 2>population looks in relation to other.</v>

375
00:20:27.251 --> 00:20:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Somehow you made it to the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a winner.</v>

376
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:31.703
<v Speaker 2>Those winning populations had many </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics within them and they </v>

377
00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:39.840
<v Speaker 2>knew how to call upon these people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

378
00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:40.674
<v Speaker 2>sideline those people and then switch it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up at the point you arrive somewhere </v>

379
00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:44.670
<v Speaker 2>else where different skills are </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

380
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:47.130
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

381
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.003
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a very simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary explanation and some of us </v>

382
00:20:50.141 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 2>have certain skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people have other skills.</v>

383
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:53.194
<v Speaker 2>And the real trick is can you figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the switching mechanism that decides </v>

384
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 2>what to call on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At what moment?</v>

385
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.240
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be the key part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

386
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.133
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like some people are going to do </v>

387
00:21:03.361 --> 00:21:04.194
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

388
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 1>some people know they should do it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't do it.</v>

389
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Some people probably shouldn't do it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

390
00:21:08.961 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 1>do it and everything in between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

391
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably have this experience too,</v>

392
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.393
<v Speaker 2>but when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people come up to me and they </v>

393
00:21:15.991 --> 00:21:16.824
<v Speaker 2>talked to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just a couple of different </v>

394
00:21:18.331 --> 00:21:20.970
<v Speaker 2>styles of conversation that unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

395
00:21:20.971 --> 00:21:21.804
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's lots of people who want to </v>

396
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:26.340
<v Speaker 2>apologize for what happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I always find odd,</v>

397
00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

398
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.550
<v Speaker 1>unless they were there in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

399
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.423
<v Speaker 1>Unless it was them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm guessing those people that have </v>

400
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.590
<v Speaker 1>never contacted me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

401
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people want to apologize,</v>

402
00:21:37.041 --> 00:21:37.874
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>

403
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:41.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to thank me and some people,</v>

404
00:21:41.511 --> 00:21:46.120
<v Speaker 2>there's this one thread which is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>facing something like this too.</v>

405
00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Can you give me some advice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

406
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say the same sort of thing to </v>

407
00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:54.050
<v Speaker 2>them and it throws them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

408
00:21:54.051 --> 00:21:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

409
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.923
<v Speaker 2>it's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to think very carefully about </v>

410
00:21:59.481 --> 00:22:04.481
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing and don't kid yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what you're signing up for and you</v>

411
00:22:04.521 --> 00:22:05.150
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

412
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 2>you just watch in their eyes as they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

413
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.620
<v Speaker 2>grapple with the fact that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get what they wanted from me,</v>

414
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.463
<v Speaker 2>what they want it to be told.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted somebody to egg them on and </v>

415
00:22:14.961 --> 00:22:15.860
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

416
00:22:15.861 --> 00:22:17.360
<v Speaker 2>It's the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll work out.</v>

417
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.340
<v Speaker 2>And you tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

418
00:22:19.341 --> 00:22:21.200
<v Speaker 2>it may not work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

419
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a moment of heartbreak,</v>

420
00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:23.774
<v Speaker 2>but my hope is that the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do it have to go through that </v>

421
00:22:29.331 --> 00:22:31.760
<v Speaker 2>little heartbreak in order to get to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>

422
00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.080
<v Speaker 2>And so among my various,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

423
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 2>jobs at the moment is to show people the</v>
<v Speaker 2>abyss.</v>

424
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

425
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.090
<v Speaker 2>is this the abyss you want to jump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it is,</v>

426
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.980
<v Speaker 2>nobody can tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

427
00:22:48.981 --> 00:22:49.814
<v Speaker 2>I certainly can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be irresponsible of me to tell </v>

428
00:22:51.711 --> 00:22:54.920
<v Speaker 2>people to do something like what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you could get,</v>

429
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.850
<v Speaker 2>you could get maimed.</v>

430
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a way it's sort of the shows that</v>

431
00:22:58.931 --> 00:22:59.764
<v Speaker 1>I'm most proud of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are the ones where I was able to </v>

432
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 1>facilitate a little bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sitting down with you.</v>

433
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:06.904
<v Speaker 1>It's sitting down with Lindsay Shepherd </v>
<v Speaker 1>who went through something very similar </v>

434
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:09.783
<v Speaker 1>in sitting down with James Damore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who did not ask to be </v>

435
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>heroes who even if I say the word hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see you're uncomfortable.</v>

436
00:23:17.351 --> 00:23:19.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the people that didn't want this.</v>

437
00:23:19.721 --> 00:23:20.554
<v Speaker 1>But somehow it got thrust upon them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then and then they got there and then </v>

438
00:23:24.191 --> 00:23:26.230
<v Speaker 1>hopefully I was able to amplify that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

439
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:29.680
<v Speaker 1>which then spreads that out to all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of other people,</v>

440
00:23:29.681 --> 00:23:30.820
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

441
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.953
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I don't want to do this for </v>

442
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.483
<v Speaker 1>obviously the entire interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just catch up on a couple of </v>

443
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.640
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do a bit more.</v>

444
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:37.590
<v Speaker 1>So there's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one</v>

445
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.750
<v Speaker 2>thing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I believe there's a little caveat to</v>

446
00:23:40.751 --> 00:23:41.584
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do it and you'd do it for the </v>

447
00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>right reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words could do it cynically.</v>

448
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.903
<v Speaker 2>You could stand up against one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in order to see if you couldn't </v>

449
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 2>get famous or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will see through that,</v>

450
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.593
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially the people who've gone ahead </v>

451
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.250
<v Speaker 2>down this road because they know </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about it.</v>

452
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.163
<v Speaker 2>But if you do it for the right reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're really trying to advance the </v>

453
00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:04.004
<v Speaker 2>ball to challenge a bad narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who have gone through this </v>

454
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:14.840
<v Speaker 2>recognize it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't feed you,</v>

455
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.140
<v Speaker 2>but it is very reassuring to discover </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people who see a,</v>

456
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.750
<v Speaker 2>the corrupt narrative who understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you challenge it.</v>

457
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

458
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.383
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're hungry to meet other people </v>

459
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:32.460
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

460
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 2>standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 2>you got to figure out what you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do to feed yourself.</v>

462
00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:38.870
<v Speaker 2>But it does put you in contact with lots</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who,</v>

463
00:24:38.871 --> 00:24:40.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are very worthwhile.</v>

464
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting because again,</v>

465
00:24:42.161 --> 00:24:45.040
<v Speaker 1>after being with Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like people will say to him,</v>

466
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get a new job.</v>

467
00:24:46.841 --> 00:24:47.674
<v Speaker 1>Should I just quit my job tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like you have to seriously </v>

468
00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:51.810
<v Speaker 1>think about what your options are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may hate your job.</v>

469
00:24:51.811 --> 00:24:53.700
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you can leave tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

470
00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.350
<v Speaker 1>You got to think about all of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

471
00:24:56.351 --> 00:24:57.184
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that is the key here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm curious how much of this has </v>

472
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.823
<v Speaker 1>shifted what you think politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you do talk about politics now </v>

473
00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.700
<v Speaker 1>and I know when I had you in there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time,</v>

474
00:25:09.701 --> 00:25:10.534
<v Speaker 1>I think I said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll revisit this question because I </v>

475
00:25:13.661 --> 00:25:14.494
<v Speaker 1>thought here's a guy that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I come from a very similar </v>

476
00:25:16.841 --> 00:25:17.674
<v Speaker 1>political places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him as a progressive and all of these </v>

477
00:25:19.241 --> 00:25:21.550
<v Speaker 1>things and now I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:25:21.551 --> 00:25:22.384
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself a classical liberal </v>

479
00:25:23.411 --> 00:25:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love libertarian ideas.</v>

480
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we just did stand up together </v>
<v Speaker 1>last night and Bray California,</v>

481
00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you and your brother joined me on stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

482
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.360
<v Speaker 1>for the second half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was mostly a conservative crowd.</v>

483
00:25:34.361 --> 00:25:35.194
<v Speaker 1>There were some trump people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some lefties and some </v>

484
00:25:36.641 --> 00:25:37.800
<v Speaker 1>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

485
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.673
<v Speaker 1>mostly conservatives and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love you guys and yet you both </v>

486
00:25:42.731 --> 00:25:45.320
<v Speaker 1>still identify as lefties and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

487
00:25:45.321 --> 00:25:47.890
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder now a year and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

488
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.263
<v Speaker 1>are you shocked at that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you are now really liked by people </v>

489
00:25:54.041 --> 00:25:54.874
<v Speaker 1>that perhaps you thought were your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology decal opponents and now you're </v>

490
00:25:57.701 --> 00:26:01.990
<v Speaker 1>sort of on the outs with the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you used to be allies with.</v>

491
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

492
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I get one every episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am</v>

493
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:14.080
<v Speaker 2>heartened and flabbergasted by what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter on the center.</v>

494
00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

495
00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:21.110
<v Speaker 2>this is not the Republican party that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember from my youth.</v>

496
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:22.063
<v Speaker 2>This is a very different entity and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it has a lot of refugees who've </v>

497
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:28.423
<v Speaker 2>been driven out of other places and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've grouped there because I don't </v>

498
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:36.020
<v Speaker 2>because because something over there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>making sense to them.</v>

499
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:36.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said to me the first time we met </v>

500
00:26:37.771 --> 00:26:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have ptsd from political,</v>

501
00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:40.630
<v Speaker 1>from the compressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

502
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.660
<v Speaker 1>And I must say we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should return to this,</v>

503
00:26:42.661 --> 00:26:43.620
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

504
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 1>was very</v>

505
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 2>heartened to hear you bring that up </v>
<v Speaker 2>during your episode with a,</v>

506
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 2>with Ben Shapiro and Eric and Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

507
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:54.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went through a cool exercise which I</v>

508
00:26:54.361 --> 00:26:58.680
<v Speaker 2>think deserves a place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with steel manning.</v>

509
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 2>And your exercise I think was something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like where is someplace that you suspect</v>

510
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.840
<v Speaker 2>your own thinking might be incorrect and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you brought up political ptsd as a place</v>

511
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:15.291
<v Speaker 2>to pay attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just say I am shocked that,</v>

512
00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the center right seems to be,</v>

513
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has protective custody of liberty and</v>

514
00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:27.210
<v Speaker 2>free speech and science of all things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

515
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:32.540
<v Speaker 2>how the heck did the center right ended </v>
<v Speaker 2>up end up having custody of these things</v>

516
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:37.170
<v Speaker 2>which are traditionally things that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right is uneasy about and the left,</v>

517
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

518
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.240
<v Speaker 2>has defended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nonetheless,</v>

519
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.400
<v Speaker 2>the people who value them are where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

520
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.400
<v Speaker 2>I think they do have something wrong.</v>

521
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:48.240
<v Speaker 2>You have your initial question was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has this changed my political view?</v>

522
00:27:48.241 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the everybody said it</v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

523
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.300
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

524
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.143
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe I am being honest with myself </v>

525
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:56.123
<v Speaker 2>when I say really hasn't changed my view</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what is true politically much if at </v>

526
00:28:03.631 --> 00:28:04.464
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because what I believe is true </v>

527
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 2>isn't predicated on anything social.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

528
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the conclusions that I reached</v>

529
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.420
<v Speaker 2>through game theory and evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

530
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.150
<v Speaker 2>And observation of the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape,</v>

531
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:19.830
<v Speaker 2>they're not things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

532
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.753
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that I went to a dinner party </v>
<v Speaker 2>and had a good time and fell in with </v>

533
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.760
<v Speaker 2>their political ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>

534
00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:28.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I am not,</v>

535
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm welcomed in certain quadrants of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

536
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:34.140
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't change anything about what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>true at all.</v>

537
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't.</v>

538
00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.160
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

539
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.860
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

540
00:28:39.861 --> 00:28:40.694
<v Speaker 1>you can go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done public events with you that </v>

541
00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:42.854
<v Speaker 1>are usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're usually invited by libertarian </v>

542
00:28:44.271 --> 00:28:45.104
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done some Iran things together </v>

543
00:28:47.421 --> 00:28:48.530
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a couple other things.</v>

544
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:49.663
<v Speaker 1>And I think everything that we've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly and when you joined me for </v>

545
00:28:51.651 --> 00:28:52.484
<v Speaker 1>standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowds all basically seem to be on </v>

546
00:28:54.051 --> 00:28:55.550
<v Speaker 1>the right as you're saying this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>

547
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:56.750
<v Speaker 1>this new center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

548
00:28:56.751 --> 00:28:57.584
<v Speaker 1>That maybe needs a better phrase than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because center rights or it needs </v>

549
00:29:00.321 --> 00:29:02.750
<v Speaker 1>something sexier than that per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

550
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.003
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you been invited anywhere by </v>

551
00:29:04.911 --> 00:29:05.744
<v Speaker 1>progressives to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell your story or to get some </v>

552
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:13.450
<v Speaker 1>comradery or empathy or sympathy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kudos or anything other than Gfe?</v>

553
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally,</v>

554
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.810
<v Speaker 2>and only slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

555
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.673
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the asymmetry is amazing and I must say </v>

556
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:21.763
<v Speaker 2>one of the most interesting things to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the early phase of this public </v>

557
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.420
<v Speaker 2>part of my life is that initially there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just this overwhelming,</v>

558
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a message that came back at me.</v>

559
00:29:36.381 --> 00:29:40.460
<v Speaker 2>You are a conservative or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism or something like that.</v>

560
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 2>And welcome to the dark side I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they usually do.</v>

561
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the point that a,</v>

562
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.840
<v Speaker 2>the phrase idw showed up on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape.</v>

563
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Then there was this point about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

564
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:55.690
<v Speaker 2>the idw is a right wing movement or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

565
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.793
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a trajectory there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something we track immediate </v>

566
00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:04.960
<v Speaker 2>effects pretty well as people we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>observe them and detect them.</v>

567
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:10.390
<v Speaker 2>There's often a slower pattern that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder for us to see.</v>

568
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.960
<v Speaker 2>And so just by analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find this is true with healing,</v>

569
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.640
<v Speaker 2>physical healing.</v>

570
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 2>If you do damage to your knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

571
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.813
<v Speaker 2>there's a one month healing trajectory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a one year and a five </v>

572
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:24.610
<v Speaker 2>year trajectory and they're much harder </v>
<v Speaker 2>to spot.</v>

573
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

574
00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:27.664
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing is the challenge </v>

575
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:34.480
<v Speaker 2>of you're on the right or now surely you</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be moving to the right,</v>

576
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just an overwhelming message </v>

577
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:38.470
<v Speaker 2>that came back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

578
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:43.530
<v Speaker 2>but the ability to talk back to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>message and say,</v>

579
00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:46.210
<v Speaker 2>actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still on the left,</v>

580
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 2>actually part of a left you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember exists.</v>

581
00:30:48.761 --> 00:30:53.761
<v Speaker 2>And one of my fears is that all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that the left was correct about is</v>

582
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:57.880
<v Speaker 2>not getting properly credited now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to the extent,</v>

583
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if people have seen this </v>
<v Speaker 2>hidden tribes,</v>

584
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.133
<v Speaker 2>a report that came out maybe a month ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that says that there's this vast </v>

585
00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Osass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 percent in the middle do agree on,</v>

586
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the desirability of a fair society that </v>

587
00:31:14.111 --> 00:31:16.870
<v Speaker 2>doesn't burden one population in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>to enrich one another.</v>

588
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:17.581
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

589
00:31:17.581 --> 00:31:18.820
<v Speaker 2>that we basically share</v>

590
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.953
<v Speaker 1>that basically it's only eight percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually that buy into this hyper </v>

591
00:31:22.541 --> 00:31:25.570
<v Speaker 1>political correctness and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rest of it is a tiny fringe.</v>

592
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.240
<v Speaker 1>The authoritarian</v>

593
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.570
<v Speaker 2>left and it's a tiny fringe on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

594
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.700
<v Speaker 2>the white nationalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

595
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.630
<v Speaker 2>And the rest of us in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.553
<v Speaker 2>we're not in perfect agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't agree on the order of the </v>

597
00:31:37.051 --> 00:31:39.780
<v Speaker 2>priorities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do agree basically on what a good</v>

598
00:31:39.781 --> 00:31:44.781
<v Speaker 2>society would function like and that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the gains,</v>

599
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.403
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

600
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.860
<v Speaker 2>the ability to be gay and out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>function in society without that being a</v>

601
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.780
<v Speaker 2>tremendous obstacle that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that,</v>

602
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left deserves credit for a racial </v>

603
00:31:58.471 --> 00:31:59.560
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

604
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:03.330
<v Speaker 2>equity is a different beast by virtue of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new,</v>

605
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.943
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hesitate to even call it that </v>

606
00:32:05.841 --> 00:32:09.390
<v Speaker 2>definition because it's not a definition</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the standard sense,</v>

607
00:32:09.391 --> 00:32:12.390
<v Speaker 2>but equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are traditional left values and we</v>

608
00:32:12.391 --> 00:32:13.224
<v Speaker 2>were right about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the fact that these things are </v>

609
00:32:16.051 --> 00:32:16.884
<v Speaker 2>now no longer controversial that belongs</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the discussion to the left has been </v>

610
00:32:19.891 --> 00:32:22.770
<v Speaker 2>right about some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also been wrong about some stuff.</v>

611
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.293
<v Speaker 2>And the right has been right about some </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and it's been wrong about some </v>

612
00:32:26.191 --> 00:32:28.380
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is time for that conversation.</v>

613
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I don't denigrate what it</v>

614
00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:34.450
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am upset with what it is.</v>

615
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:38.590
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps guys like you and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother and Sam,</v>

616
00:32:38.591 --> 00:32:39.424
<v Speaker 1>some people that still identify as left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these will be able to do a reclamation </v>

617
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:47.651
<v Speaker 1>project that I just don't see anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see sort of more that this thing needs</v>

618
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:50.690
<v Speaker 1>to burn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So out of the ashes of Phoenix can rise.</v>

619
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 1>That's just maybe a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactical thing,</v>

620
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:53.504
<v Speaker 1>but let's just jump back to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary explanation for some of </v>

621
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:57.980
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I asked you about why some people can</v>

622
00:32:57.981 --> 00:33:00.740
<v Speaker 1>do this from an evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary perspective,</v>

623
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.470
<v Speaker 1>why some people are able to step up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people aren't.</v>

624
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.513
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the evolutionary explanation for </v>

625
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 1>why this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say eight percent,</v>

626
00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:10.934
<v Speaker 1>very loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but small group of people feel the need </v>

627
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 1>to purge everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there.</v>

628
00:33:14.811 --> 00:33:15.644
<v Speaker 1>Is there an evolutionary because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems it would be almost counter to </v>

629
00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:19.034
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd want to have more commonalities </v>

630
00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:22.724
<v Speaker 1>with people and bring in a big tent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I see them consistently doing </v>

631
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.460
<v Speaker 1>is just getting rid of everybody who </v>
<v Speaker 1>dare you.</v>

632
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Talk back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the God.</v>

633
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

634
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:33.063
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had known this was going to </v>

635
00:33:34.811 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 1>come up because I would have looked it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

636
00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:36.610
<v Speaker 1>but there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

637
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:37.350
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

638
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.183
<v Speaker 1>put me on the spot.</v>

639
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.443
<v Speaker 2>Say I'm a report that emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was six or eight months ago </v>

640
00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:47.820
<v Speaker 2>that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't looked into it and it's not my</v>

641
00:33:47.821 --> 00:33:49.020
<v Speaker 2>area of specialty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

642
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounded right to me.</v>

643
00:33:51.031 --> 00:33:54.000
<v Speaker 2>And what it said was that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

644
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a particular personality trait,</v>

645
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism that isn't ideological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really care whether it's a,</v>

646
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:08.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending fascism or communism,</v>

647
00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.470
<v Speaker 2>what it wants to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his boss,</v>

648
00:34:10.471 --> 00:34:13.740
<v Speaker 2>people around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that essentially what's confusing to</v>

649
00:34:13.741 --> 00:34:14.574
<v Speaker 2>people is that at the moment these dyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the wool authoritarians are </v>

650
00:34:18.901 --> 00:34:19.734
<v Speaker 2>concentrated over on the left and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying stuff that sounds </v>

651
00:34:22.051 --> 00:34:25.530
<v Speaker 2>nominally like leftist stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

652
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the winds to shift.</v>

653
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:31.140
<v Speaker 2>And the authoritarians have the moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be over on the right.</v>

654
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.060
<v Speaker 2>They be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

655
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

656
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:35.783
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I would like people yourself </v>

657
00:34:40.861 --> 00:34:41.694
<v Speaker 2>included to consider is that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost no point in engaging those </v>

658
00:34:47.431 --> 00:34:48.570
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

659
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.410
<v Speaker 2>This question of the importance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberty is settled,</v>

660
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.753
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 80 percent of us in the middle all </v>

661
00:34:56.811 --> 00:34:57.644
<v Speaker 2>get</v>

662
00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.470
<v Speaker 2>the fringe on the far left and the far </v>
<v Speaker 2>right are,</v>

663
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:03.603
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say safe to ignore </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they can always rise up and </v>

664
00:35:06.191 --> 00:35:08.260
<v Speaker 2>become important as the one on the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>is doing.</v>

665
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

666
00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:11.973
<v Speaker 2>that's not where the game is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The game is all of the people who can't </v>

667
00:35:15.101 --> 00:35:20.101
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to escape from the stigma</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that is driving civilization.</v>

668
00:35:21.921 --> 00:35:22.754
<v Speaker 2>So all of the people who are falling in </v>
<v Speaker 2>line with what's going on on the </v>

669
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:30.250
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the people to reach.</v>

670
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Speaker 2>And what you raised about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

671
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.930
<v Speaker 2>let's say the audience last night at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy club and you know,</v>

672
00:35:34.931 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 2>this is reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was the second one I with you.</v>

673
00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:42.411
<v Speaker 2>It was exactly the same the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that is so heartening is,</v>

674
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can come into a room and you're right,</v>

675
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.223
<v Speaker 2>that room last night must have been 95 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent right of center and first thing </v>

676
00:35:55.651 --> 00:35:58.260
<v Speaker 2>you tell them is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a,</v>

677
00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a progressive.</v>

678
00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell them I'm a radical,</v>

679
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:03.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

680
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.030
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't dampen their enthusiasm one </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

681
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:07.020
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

682
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.263
<v Speaker 2>they're thrilled to discover that things</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not so bleak and that there is </v>

683
00:36:13.081 --> 00:36:13.914
<v Speaker 2>somebody on the other side of this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's still talking reasonably and can </v>

684
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:17.484
<v Speaker 2>hear them and can see them and doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that they're racist and out of </v>

685
00:36:19.981 --> 00:36:21.990
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>

686
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I take a lot of flack for </v>

687
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:29.730
<v Speaker 2>interacting with the right and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to that flag because it is the</v>

688
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:33.370
<v Speaker 2>best thing we can do is to engage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

689
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you spot the humanity of the people</v>

690
00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:37.044
<v Speaker 2>on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then to the extent that we differ over </v>

691
00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:41.130
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about it.</v>

692
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.633
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we could keep going down this </v>

693
00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:44.234
<v Speaker 1>Pandora's box of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of lunacy related to everything that </v>

694
00:36:47.631 --> 00:36:49.070
<v Speaker 1>you've been through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's do,</v>

695
00:36:49.071 --> 00:36:49.904
<v Speaker 1>let's just catch it up to where we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and we can start looking at the </v>

696
00:36:51.561 --> 00:36:52.394
<v Speaker 1>future a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you and your wife had there who you </v>

697
00:36:54.351 --> 00:36:54.950
<v Speaker 1>referenced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heather.</v>

698
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's been on the show?</v>

699
00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a brilliant professor as well.</v>

700
00:36:57.771 --> 00:36:58.181
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

701
00:36:58.181 --> 00:36:59.014
<v Speaker 1>and has that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that brave evolutionary tick that you </v>

702
00:37:02.061 --> 00:37:02.894
<v Speaker 1>have to have you end up marrying a woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was going to have the same </v>

703
00:37:04.821 --> 00:37:05.870
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

704
00:37:05.871 --> 00:37:06.704
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty good.</v>

705
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.030
<v Speaker 2>You really want to know the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

706
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:09.913
<v Speaker 2>I'm heather and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were not going out but we were </v>

707
00:37:12.091 --> 00:37:17.091
<v Speaker 2>friends in high school and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that others will understand the phrase,</v>

708
00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:18.984
<v Speaker 2>but the one that runs in my head is </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody goes to high school with the </v>

709
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:24.780
<v Speaker 2>girl you should marry and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

710
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

711
00:37:26.821 --> 00:37:28.020
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

712
00:37:28.021 --> 00:37:29.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

713
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I was a confused kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like every other kid that age,</v>

714
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:38.420
<v Speaker 2>there was something about her that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed so very right.</v>

715
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:44.450
<v Speaker 2>And I have to say I was right about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>best decision I ever made.</v>

716
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:46.303
<v Speaker 1>Was she ever pissed at you during this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you sort of thrust her in the </v>

717
00:37:49.341 --> 00:37:50.174
<v Speaker 1>spotlight to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact is both of you left your </v>

718
00:37:52.071 --> 00:37:54.050
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a $500,000</v>

719
00:37:54.051 --> 00:37:59.051
<v Speaker 1>settlement for two tenured positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which to some people that's $500,000.</v>

720
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a lot of money,</v>

721
00:38:00.501 --> 00:38:02.570
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is your life's work.</v>

722
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:03.404
<v Speaker 1>You and your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've since relocated your family and </v>

723
00:38:05.271 --> 00:38:06.650
<v Speaker 1>your two kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

724
00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.030
<v Speaker 1>so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is massive.</v>

725
00:38:08.031 --> 00:38:10.340
<v Speaker 1>500 grand in the scheme of that is not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>

726
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.810
<v Speaker 1>but was she ever never</v>

727
00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.430
<v Speaker 2>bothered or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or hesitant by what you doing?</v>

728
00:38:15.431 --> 00:38:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Because she didn't go public about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>until a bit after.</v>

729
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was never pissed.</v>

730
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Not for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She and I were in complete agreement.</v>

731
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.900
<v Speaker 2>We saw the same thing unfolded </v>
<v Speaker 2>evergreen.</v>

732
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.221
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

733
00:38:30.221 --> 00:38:31.054
<v Speaker 2>the nature of our teaching at Evergreen </v>
<v Speaker 2>was kind of interesting in the sense we </v>

734
00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:36.904
<v Speaker 2>had like a little undeclared graduate </v>
<v Speaker 2>program and evolutionary biology where </v>

735
00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:41.644
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't award you a master's degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you were interested in </v>

736
00:38:43.931 --> 00:38:46.690
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary biology and many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know they were,</v>

737
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:47.524
<v Speaker 2>but they would take my program and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I would sort of nudge them over </v>

738
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:53.261
<v Speaker 2>towards Harrisburg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

739
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:54.094
<v Speaker 2>So we had students bouncing back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth and we had a community of people </v>

740
00:38:56.441 --> 00:39:01.441
<v Speaker 2>that were in our circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the basic point is that creates a,</v>

741
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.733
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an opportunity for every night at </v>

742
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:09.371
<v Speaker 2>dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either an,</v>

743
00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:10.204
<v Speaker 2>I would compare notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we were seeing at the college and </v>

744
00:39:11.981 --> 00:39:13.710
<v Speaker 2>all of these things talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

745
00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.740
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

746
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.250
<v Speaker 2>what the students blind spot is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do particularly well.</v>

747
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:22.990
<v Speaker 2>And as this unfolded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heather and I saw the identical,</v>

748
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:24.183
<v Speaker 2>a picture or maybe the way to say it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the picture of what was happening </v>

749
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 2>emerged between us as we discussed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was,</v>

750
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.883
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What put me in the bullseye was the </v>

751
00:39:37.721 --> 00:39:39.340
<v Speaker 2>emails that I wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

752
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:40.174
<v Speaker 2>I said in faculty meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never wrote an email that heather </v>

753
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:44.914
<v Speaker 2>didn't look at first and tell me it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready and frankly there were a lot of </v>

754
00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:54.070
<v Speaker 2>emails that I didn't send and if I made </v>
<v Speaker 2>one error,</v>

755
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I believe I should have sent everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

756
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.753
<v Speaker 2>because what they do is they leave a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a historical record of what is taking </v>

757
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:04.600
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the descent was in retrospect,</v>

758
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.910
<v Speaker 2>very clear as you went back through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emails.</v>

759
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:08.201
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

760
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:08.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heather,</v>

761
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:12.040
<v Speaker 2>heather was in complete agreement the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole time and I think,</v>

762
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.053
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the confrontation was less in keeping </v>

763
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.173
<v Speaker 2>with her personality traits than mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of her commitment and her </v>

764
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.720
<v Speaker 2>belief in what we were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a team effort.</v>

765
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:28.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a lesson in marriage right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

766
00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.350
<v Speaker 1>And there's probably many lessons in </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

767
00:40:30.351 --> 00:40:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

768
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just get to where you are now.</v>

769
00:40:33.951 --> 00:40:34.784
<v Speaker 1>You guys have left Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither one of you are teaching at the </v>

770
00:40:38.421 --> 00:40:39.254
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to figure out what your </v>

771
00:40:41.031 --> 00:40:42.800
<v Speaker 1>future is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume the same with heather.</v>

772
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.560
<v Speaker 1>What is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one and number two?</v>

773
00:40:45.561 --> 00:40:46.394
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised to know that schools have not </v>

774
00:40:49.521 --> 00:40:51.080
<v Speaker 1>thrown offers at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

775
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.133
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a seriously great public </v>

776
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.410
<v Speaker 1>profile now you are respected by so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

777
00:40:57.411 --> 00:41:00.230
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have fans and not just students.</v>

778
00:41:00.231 --> 00:41:01.064
<v Speaker 1>Now you have former students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have fans that would love to </v>

779
00:41:03.381 --> 00:41:06.620
<v Speaker 1>sign up for courses that you would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching and all sorts of things where I</v>

780
00:41:06.621 --> 00:41:08.510
<v Speaker 1>think most people would look at this on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their face and think,</v>

781
00:41:08.511 --> 00:41:10.220
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an asset this would.</v>

782
00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.070
<v Speaker 1>This guy would be not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually but pr wise and all that.</v>

783
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.380
<v Speaker 2>That's not where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely not.</v>

784
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.160
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

785
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:18.993
<v Speaker 2>it does say something and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an outsider to whatever discussions </v>

786
00:41:21.911 --> 00:41:25.810
<v Speaker 2>it is that result in nothing of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort coming our way,</v>

787
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.390
<v Speaker 2>but it is conspicuous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

788
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.660
<v Speaker 2>so you asked what it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's like,</v>

789
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

790
00:41:33.411 --> 00:41:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

791
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:40.280
<v Speaker 2>a very unusual experience in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

792
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:41.114
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life was great before any of this </v>

793
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.920
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great now.</v>

794
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lack of security is frightening when</v>

795
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 2>I stare at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

796
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.100
<v Speaker 2>heather and I have two kids and if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

797
00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:56.283
<v Speaker 2>we would be in a different position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could take risks and we could afford </v>

798
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:01.170
<v Speaker 2>to go through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

799
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 2>years of austerity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as it is,</v>

800
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:06.980
<v Speaker 2>we have responsibilities and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our kids didn't sign up for this.</v>

801
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I mean they would have said,</v>

802
00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.560
<v Speaker 1>are you saying they didn't get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene?</v>

803
00:42:12.561 --> 00:42:13.720
<v Speaker 1>What are you telling me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

804
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:14.563
<v Speaker 1>they're bored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's our responsibility to protect </v>

805
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:17.631
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

806
00:42:17.631 --> 00:42:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing has been a</v>

807
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.573
<v Speaker 2>frightening from the point of view of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it means for the future because </v>

808
00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

809
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.920
<v Speaker 2>it seems like things are headed along a </v>
<v Speaker 2>path in which,</v>

810
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the settlement that you mentioned is a </v>

811
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:38.330
<v Speaker 2>tiny fraction of what we would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>earned over the rest of our careers.</v>

812
00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 2>And a huge amount of it was burned up </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying lawyers and uh,</v>

813
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.751
<v Speaker 2>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

814
00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:45.584
<v Speaker 2>you get all that money in one chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got about two years of buffer </v>

815
00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 2>money from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't,</v>

816
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.170
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like we got bought out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

817
00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:55.004
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could have in a state that had </v>

818
00:42:57.891 --> 00:43:01.910
<v Speaker 2>punitive damages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we likely could have won a,</v>

819
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.493
<v Speaker 2>something much more like 4 million bucks</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the amount of income that we would </v>

820
00:43:08.571 --> 00:43:10.910
<v Speaker 2>have earned over the rest of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>careers.</v>

821
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.700
<v Speaker 1>How and why did you guys not go that </v>
<v Speaker 1>route?</v>

822
00:43:12.701 --> 00:43:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Because I think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they saw the number,</v>

823
00:43:14.951 --> 00:43:15.784
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I saw the number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I just saw an article or </v>

824
00:43:17.501 --> 00:43:18.400
<v Speaker 1>something and I was like,</v>

825
00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

826
00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why so low?</v>

827
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Because Washington is one of 11 states </v>
<v Speaker 2>without punitive damages.</v>

828
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:24.710
<v Speaker 2>It's that sense.</v>

829
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:25.543
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you said that Washington </v>

830
00:43:26.291 --> 00:43:27.830
<v Speaker 1>didn't have punitive damages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

831
00:43:27.831 --> 00:43:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I just misheard you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

832
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.050
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

833
00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:31.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that caused us</v>

834
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.590
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

835
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.110
<v Speaker 2>effectively cut our losses and decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>

836
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.693
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did the best we could with evergreen </v>

837
00:43:40.471 --> 00:43:43.740
<v Speaker 2>in cutting our ties with them at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point that they made it clear.</v>

838
00:43:43.741 --> 00:43:44.574
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

839
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:49.620
<v Speaker 2>they behaved atrociously in negotiations</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one thing.</v>

840
00:43:49.621 --> 00:43:50.454
<v Speaker 2>They dragged their heels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't sit down with us until we </v>

841
00:43:52.531 --> 00:43:54.780
<v Speaker 2>were already back on contract for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next year,</v>

842
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:58.050
<v Speaker 2>fully assuming that we would be going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back into a classroom,</v>

843
00:43:58.051 --> 00:44:00.330
<v Speaker 2>but what would it be like to walk onto a</v>
<v Speaker 2>campus that is,</v>

844
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying a pr firm to demonize you.</v>

845
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would that be like?</v>

846
00:44:04.741 --> 00:44:07.290
<v Speaker 2>And we would have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

847
00:44:07.291 --> 00:44:10.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they insulted us in negotiations.</v>

848
00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:12.510
<v Speaker 2>They offered us panic buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

849
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:16.170
<v Speaker 2>As if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So panic buttons in the room literally.</v>

850
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

851
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.980
<v Speaker 1>as if the problem was that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>panicking,</v>

852
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than that they had,</v>

853
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:24.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could've at least they offered you </v>

854
00:44:24.891 --> 00:44:27.740
<v Speaker 1>a counter baseball bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that have been nice?</v>

855
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something,</v>

856
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:30.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't to end,</v>

857
00:44:30.471 --> 00:44:31.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

858
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.580
<v Speaker 2>hobbling the police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing was a fiasco.</v>

859
00:44:35.581 --> 00:44:36.890
<v Speaker 2>So we cut our losses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>

860
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 2>we've moved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moved to Portland,</v>

861
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 2>which is wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's</v>

862
00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 1>in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not interpretation,</v>

863
00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.773
<v Speaker 1>but it is a marvelous place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went to the only more progressive </v>

864
00:44:46.881 --> 00:44:47.820
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

865
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.840
<v Speaker 1>it does seem that we have here a glutton</v>
<v Speaker 1>for punishment onto that</v>

866
00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.110
<v Speaker 2>belly of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

867
00:44:53.111 --> 00:44:53.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

868
00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.850
<v Speaker 2>the beauty of Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

869
00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:56.733
<v Speaker 2>there's a beauty and there's a tragedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is this a equity and inclusion </v>

870
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:02.343
<v Speaker 2>thing and it seems to go up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mayor's office who happens to also </v>

871
00:45:05.561 --> 00:45:06.394
<v Speaker 2>frighteningly and a parallel to </v>
<v Speaker 2>evergreen be the police commissioner so </v>

872
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:14.790
<v Speaker 2>he can stand down the police and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and has done so in some sort of</v>

873
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:16.043
<v Speaker 1>from that video from a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago with antifa basically running </v>

874
00:45:18.881 --> 00:45:20.530
<v Speaker 1>traffic in the middle of Portland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

875
00:45:20.531 --> 00:45:21.364
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unfathomable that that's happening </v>

876
00:45:23.771 --> 00:45:25.870
<v Speaker 1>in the streets of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

877
00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

878
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:29.350
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are flirting with the same.</v>

879
00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.213
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the same story as evergreen </v>

880
00:45:31.211 --> 00:45:31.900
<v Speaker 1>except,</v>

881
00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a major American city,</v>

882
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:36.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a college,</v>

883
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:37.563
<v Speaker 2>a play games with literal anarchy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous enough to have a city doing </v>

884
00:45:43.691 --> 00:45:44.920
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

885
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I shutter to them.</v>

886
00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't want to think about Texas.</v>

887
00:45:47.351 --> 00:45:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I really on this tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you to San Antonio,</v>

888
00:45:50.321 --> 00:45:51.700
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd have a field day over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

889
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

890
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.290
<v Speaker 2>other part of liberalism is also true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Important.</v>

891
00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:01.440
<v Speaker 2>So I never encounter a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the antifa madness and the mayor and his</v>

892
00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:06.520
<v Speaker 2>confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

893
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.020
<v Speaker 2>it's like the mayor of your town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never,</v>

894
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:12.280
<v Speaker 2>never run into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I do run into is a clean,</v>

895
00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:16.900
<v Speaker 2>a functional city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People as far as I can tell,</v>

896
00:46:16.901 --> 00:46:19.360
<v Speaker 2>are very decent to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

897
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make provisions for cyclists to </v>

898
00:46:23.051 --> 00:46:28.051
<v Speaker 2>commute around the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think in some sense Portland is,</v>

899
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.753
<v Speaker 2>it shows exactly the conflict between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left better instincts in its worst </v>

900
00:46:33.671 --> 00:46:35.730
<v Speaker 2>instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

901
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.733
<v Speaker 2>I hope that it will come around to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of enlightened progressivism that </v>

902
00:46:41.711 --> 00:46:42.544
<v Speaker 2>used to exist rather than the naive </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressivism that seems to have taken </v>

903
00:46:45.281 --> 00:46:46.720
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

904
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.340
<v Speaker 1>let's shift all together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

905
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really know.</v>

906
00:46:51.021 --> 00:46:52.190
<v Speaker 1>How about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

907
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biology.</v>

908
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I thought this would be an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to start.</v>

909
00:46:57.231 --> 00:46:58.064
<v Speaker 1>You just recently did a talk with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins just in the last couple </v>

910
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:01.790
<v Speaker 1>of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

911
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:06.110
<v Speaker 1>as I understand the video of it should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be up online somewhat soon.</v>

912
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.080
<v Speaker 1>It will be up within a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

913
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:13.100
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully people will be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually watch this conversation.</v>

914
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.243
<v Speaker 1>I'm very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this event was put together by </v>

915
00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:17.234
<v Speaker 1>Pangbourne philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a little tumbled around </v>

916
00:47:20.241 --> 00:47:23.240
<v Speaker 1>that and I know you just wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly address what's going on there.</v>

917
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So pangbourne philosophy is obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>imploded and that has</v>

918
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.023
<v Speaker 2>left people speculating about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and why some of us like myself </v>

919
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:35.284
<v Speaker 2>continued to participate with Pangbourne</v>
<v Speaker 2>just very quickly for people that have </v>

920
00:47:38.621 --> 00:47:39.454
<v Speaker 2>no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were putting together a lot of the </v>

921
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:41.283
<v Speaker 2>public events that included a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the one that you moderated with </v>

922
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vancouver.</v>

923
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:48.640
<v Speaker 2>Also the one that Douglas Murray </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderated,</v>

924
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:49.474
<v Speaker 2>which I think was that in the UK or was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Australia is one in Dublin and one </v>

925
00:47:52.121 --> 00:47:53.600
<v Speaker 2>in London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

926
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:54.453
<v Speaker 2>and then a series of other events like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that you did with Dawkins and </v>

927
00:47:57.161 --> 00:48:01.150
<v Speaker 2>this this day of reflection that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to happen on November 17th that</v>

928
00:48:01.151 --> 00:48:04.720
<v Speaker 2>we all pulled out of which now I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take it from there.</v>

929
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

930
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:06.573
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just say that I know that there </v>

931
00:48:09.691 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 2>is a lot of speculation about what took </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

932
00:48:12.371 --> 00:48:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Why people pulled out of the New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>

933
00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.124
<v Speaker 2>why some of us like myself stayed in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in at the point that it was </v>

934
00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.053
<v Speaker 2>canceled a couple of days ago and I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>hope people will recognize that there </v>

935
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:26.440
<v Speaker 2>was a predicament for those of us like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

936
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.850
<v Speaker 2>like myself and like Eric who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the,</v>

937
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:31.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Pangbourne situation and trying to </v>

938
00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:35.644
<v Speaker 2>figure out what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was at the point that Pangbourne </v>

939
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:44.110
<v Speaker 2>canceled the Auckland event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something new emerged.</v>

940
00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.153
<v Speaker 2>So other events had been canceled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there had always been refunds for </v>

941
00:48:47.201 --> 00:48:50.590
<v Speaker 2>people who had bought tickets at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point he canceled the Oakland event.</v>

942
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:51.873
<v Speaker 2>There was a lack of refund money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which called our attention to the fact </v>

943
00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:56.734
<v Speaker 2>that something was off money that should</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been kept separately for that </v>

944
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:02.110
<v Speaker 2>event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that if it was canceled,</v>

945
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 2>it could've all been refunded somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't with.</v>

946
00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:05.850
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

947
00:49:05.851 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 2>and to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys,</v>

948
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.513
<v Speaker 2>and I think not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys hadn't been paid for some </v>

949
00:49:09.821 --> 00:49:10.654
<v Speaker 2>previous things too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't just about the people that </v>

950
00:49:12.821 --> 00:49:13.920
<v Speaker 2>were buying the tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

951
00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't Auckland,</v>

952
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:19.000
<v Speaker 2>it was Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sydney is where speakers,</v>

953
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:19.893
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where speakers didn't get paid </v>

954
00:49:21.671 --> 00:49:22.504
<v Speaker 2>for the first time and I'm certainly one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people who didn't get paid and </v>

955
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:26.770
<v Speaker 2>still haven't been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

956
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also as a sidebar,</v>

957
00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:28.180
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

958
00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.660
<v Speaker 2>So that is why I pulled out of the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>of reflection thing in New York.</v>

959
00:49:31.661 --> 00:49:32.494
<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to host the whole day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when I realized that people </v>

960
00:49:34.661 --> 00:49:35.494
<v Speaker 2>hadn't been paid for previous things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had heard through the grapevine that </v>

961
00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:39.970
<v Speaker 2>there was some shady stuff going on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said,</v>

962
00:49:39.971 --> 00:49:40.804
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just not get involved in this </v>

963
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:44.410
<v Speaker 2>mess in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which makes perfect sense.</v>

964
00:49:44.411 --> 00:49:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think what I did also makes perfect</v>

965
00:49:46.481 --> 00:49:47.350
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

966
00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.690
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at the situation and I said,</v>

967
00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:51.183
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got people who haven't been </v>

968
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.553
<v Speaker 2>refunded their money for Auckland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got speakers from Sydney who </v>

969
00:49:56.891 --> 00:50:01.891
<v Speaker 2>haven't been paid and if the New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>event comes apart,</v>

970
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.860
<v Speaker 2>then it's going to compound that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to create new,</v>

971
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.080
<v Speaker 2>a ticket holders who haven't been paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

972
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.413
<v Speaker 2>and so my thought was let's have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>event that gives people what they paid </v>

973
00:50:16.721 --> 00:50:20.080
<v Speaker 2>for so that we don't make the damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse and I certainly didn't sign up for</v>

974
00:50:20.081 --> 00:50:20.914
<v Speaker 2>anything new after the Oakland event was</v>
<v Speaker 2>canceled and there was a failure to </v>

975
00:50:24.761 --> 00:50:26.020
<v Speaker 2>repay patrons.</v>

976
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:26.853
<v Speaker 2>But my thought was from the point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>view of protecting the fan base from </v>

977
00:50:31.851 --> 00:50:35.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever was going on behind the scenes </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Pangbourne,</v>

978
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.193
<v Speaker 2>the better part of valor was to make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>event happen and be successful rather </v>

979
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:45.251
<v Speaker 2>than create another auckland situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in any case that,</v>

980
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:47.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I should also point out that up </v>

981
00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:54.281
<v Speaker 2>until so Pangbourne gave us a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of warning just a couple of</v>

982
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 2>days before he canceled it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he was about to cancel it.</v>

983
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.670
<v Speaker 2>And Eric and I tried to save it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

984
00:51:01.671 --> 00:51:02.504
<v Speaker 2>Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had pulled out of the event quietly </v>

985
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:06.320
<v Speaker 2>so as not to cripple it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

986
00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:07.943
<v Speaker 2>and he and I got on the phone with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Travis and we tried to get travis to </v>

987
00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:18.090
<v Speaker 2>agree to hold the event and to let us </v>
<v Speaker 2>rescue that.</v>

988
00:51:18.171 --> 00:51:19.004
<v Speaker 2>We offered to work for free and we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have liked to have held the event so </v>

989
00:51:23.631 --> 00:51:24.464
<v Speaker 2>that it wouldn't cause further harm to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and I don't know why Travis </v>

990
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:30.950
<v Speaker 2>refused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he did.</v>

991
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:34.790
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got canceled and I,</v>

992
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

993
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.353
<v Speaker 2>I do want people to understand that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was not that anybody was unaware that </v>

994
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:47.141
<v Speaker 2>something was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question was what's best for the fan</v>

995
00:51:48.081 --> 00:51:50.240
<v Speaker 2>base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movement to the extent that there is</v>

996
00:51:50.241 --> 00:51:51.074
<v Speaker 2>a movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it better to have another event </v>

997
00:51:52.431 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 2>canceled and have more harm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think so.</v>

998
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:56.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know this is all a little insider </v>

999
00:51:57.191 --> 00:51:58.024
<v Speaker 1>baseball for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know you just want it to get that </v>

1000
00:51:59.471 --> 00:52:01.390
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm glad that it is a few of us.</v>

1001
00:52:01.391 --> 00:52:02.224
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had discussed possibly doing a free </v>

1002
00:52:04.091 --> 00:52:04.924
<v Speaker 1>thing and who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there will be something in the </v>

1003
00:52:06.191 --> 00:52:07.024
<v Speaker 1>future if people end up getting stiffed </v>
<v Speaker 1>on ticket prices because obviously we </v>

1004
00:52:09.401 --> 00:52:11.380
<v Speaker 1>want people to get something and if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can all figure it out,</v>

1005
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:12.311
<v Speaker 1>we will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1006
00:52:12.311 --> 00:52:14.950
<v Speaker 1>So that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did do an event with Richard Dawkins</v>

1007
00:52:14.951 --> 00:52:16.750
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video should be up soon enough.</v>

1008
00:52:16.751 --> 00:52:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should we expect from this?</v>

1009
00:52:20.261 --> 00:52:21.300
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1010
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I think on its face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people would say,</v>

1011
00:52:23.681 --> 00:52:24.514
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1012
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.530
<v Speaker 1>we've got Weinstein and Dawkins,</v>

1013
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:29.920
<v Speaker 2>these guys should agree on everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't they.</v>

1014
00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:31.803
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this goes back to the question of what </v>

1015
00:52:32.921 --> 00:52:37.921
<v Speaker 2>happened to evolutionary biology 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and um,</v>

1016
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.710
<v Speaker 2>darkens and I do agree on a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount,</v>

1017
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:47.070
<v Speaker 2>but the place at which we start </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreeing I think is a branching point</v>

1018
00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:50.283
<v Speaker 2>where you have the way evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory went 30 years ago and the way it </v>

1019
00:52:54.101 --> 00:52:55.300
<v Speaker 2>should have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1020
00:52:55.301 --> 00:52:59.020
<v Speaker 2>that's not an indictment in and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

1021
00:52:59.050 --> 00:52:59.883
<v Speaker 2>Fields take wrong turns all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what should happen is you should </v>

1022
00:53:03.791 --> 00:53:08.440
<v Speaker 2>detect that you're on the wrong path </v>
<v Speaker 2>because suddenly progress ceases.</v>

1023
00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 2>And that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1024
00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.690
<v Speaker 2>so what actually happened 30 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>that got us?</v>

1025
00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.013
<v Speaker 2>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that the last piece of </v>

1026
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:22.150
<v Speaker 2>progress that we all really agree now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been lots of empirical work,</v>

1027
00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.013
<v Speaker 2>but the last piece of theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress actually involves a Dawkins' </v>

1028
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:28.703
<v Speaker 2>selfish gene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially encapsulates a </v>

1029
00:53:31.231 --> 00:53:32.064
<v Speaker 2>synthesis that does lots of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including brings a proper theory of </v>

1030
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 2>cultural evolution online.</v>

1031
00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Which cultural evolution is a non issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>for almost all creatures.</v>

1032
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:48.780
<v Speaker 2>But for birds and mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big deal.</v>

1033
00:53:48.781 --> 00:53:49.614
<v Speaker 2>And for human beings it is the big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to the extent that we did not have a </v>

1034
00:53:54.001 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 2>way of discussing cultural evolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>prior to the selfish gene doctrines,</v>

1035
00:53:58.591 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 2>introduction of the concept of memes </v>
<v Speaker 2>which have now been trivialized by,</v>

1036
00:54:02.821 --> 00:54:03.654
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people putting funny captions on </v>

1037
00:54:04.561 --> 00:54:06.120
<v Speaker 2>pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the concept of,</v>

1038
00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:06.993
<v Speaker 2>I think you could argue they've become </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most relevant way of communication </v>

1039
00:54:09.631 --> 00:54:11.530
<v Speaker 2>in a bizarre way this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they'd be.</v>

1040
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:13.200
<v Speaker 2>They've become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1041
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:14.063
<v Speaker 2>little tidbits become little bites and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact is almost everything about </v>

1042
00:54:19.021 --> 00:54:21.360
<v Speaker 2>human beings that is interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>special,</v>

1043
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:25.920
<v Speaker 2>at least touches cultural evolution if </v>
<v Speaker 2>not is entirely housed there.</v>

1044
00:54:25.921 --> 00:54:26.754
<v Speaker 2>So in order to understand ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to get this cultural revolution </v>

1045
00:54:30.301 --> 00:54:32.610
<v Speaker 2>things straight and document set us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

1046
00:54:32.611 --> 00:54:33.630
<v Speaker 2>on the right path.</v>

1047
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Chapter Eleven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he introduces the word meme,</v>

1048
00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:38.910
<v Speaker 2>he introduces the concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sets us in motion,</v>

1049
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:42.540
<v Speaker 2>but he makes an error in that chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No big deal.</v>

1050
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:43.403
<v Speaker 2>We all make errors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it hasn't been corrected in 30 </v>

1051
00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:46.660
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so so.</v>

1052
00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 2>So what does that error?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The error is in a,</v>

1053
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:51.623
<v Speaker 2>a misportrayed will of the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between culture and its evolutionary </v>

1054
00:54:56.401 --> 00:54:58.980
<v Speaker 2>units and genes and the way that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve.</v>

1055
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:00.143
<v Speaker 2>So what Dawkins says and that chapter is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means the units of cultural </v>

1056
00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:08.220
<v Speaker 2>evolution exists in a new primeval soup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1057
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.990
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a new kind of evolution.</v>

1058
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:10.853
<v Speaker 2>It begins at the point that culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>begins to happen and it is independent </v>

1059
00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:16.163
<v Speaker 2>of the genes that cannot be the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot be the case because the only </v>

1060
00:55:22.141 --> 00:55:22.974
<v Speaker 2>reason that you are able to pick up </v>
<v Speaker 2>units of cultural evolution is because </v>

1061
00:55:27.361 --> 00:55:32.361
<v Speaker 2>you have a brain that your genes created</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hospitable to those things.</v>

1062
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Which means that to the extent that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>a culture starts wasting the time.</v>

1063
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:42.210
<v Speaker 2>And the energy and the resources of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes,</v>

1064
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:45.000
<v Speaker 2>the genes are in a perfect position to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shut it down.</v>

1065
00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:46.763
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my point to Dawkins on stage in </v>

1066
00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Chicago was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can't be right,</v>

1067
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:52.853
<v Speaker 2>and if you make an adjustment to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory that you darkens presented in </v>

1068
00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:03.150
<v Speaker 2>1976,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you adjust it correctly,</v>

1069
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:06.010
<v Speaker 2>you discover that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1070
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:07.103
<v Speaker 2>many things that are paradoxical about </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural evolution are no longer </v>

1071
00:56:11.431 --> 00:56:16.200
<v Speaker 2>paradoxical and many things about human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings are suddenly tractable.</v>

1072
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.530
<v Speaker 2>So can you give me an example of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give you the ultimate example.</v>

1073
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:20.543
<v Speaker 2>I will accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the ultimate example has to do </v>

1074
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:27.460
<v Speaker 2>with a religion and things that function</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

1075
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.010
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1076
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:30.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the antithesis of some little </v>

1077
00:56:32.381 --> 00:56:34.540
<v Speaker 2>picture with a caption on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1078
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 2>You Imagine Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1079
00:56:37.421 --> 00:56:38.254
<v Speaker 2>Catholicism is a set of beliefs that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>profound implications on the way that </v>

1080
00:56:45.161 --> 00:56:45.994
<v Speaker 2>believers deploy their efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their resources to things that they </v>

1081
00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:51.940
<v Speaker 2>elevate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that they,</v>

1082
00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:53.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue all of that.</v>

1083
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.830
<v Speaker 2>So the question is why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1084
00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:02.130
<v Speaker 2>So dawkins and I would agree there is no</v>
<v Speaker 2>supernatural explanation necessary to,</v>

1085
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpret what is taking place on earth </v>

1086
00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:08.794
<v Speaker 2>or anywhere else in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a supernatural </v>

1087
00:57:10.331 --> 00:57:13.930
<v Speaker 2>explanation if you were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain phenomena.</v>

1088
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.633
<v Speaker 2>So why is it that people who hold a </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief that supernatural forces are at </v>

1089
00:57:20.081 --> 00:57:25.081
<v Speaker 2>the heart of a human affairs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are those people so successful?</v>

1090
00:57:25.991 --> 00:57:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Historically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>

1091
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:29.650
<v Speaker 2>And Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I disagree with it,</v>

1092
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I would disagree over it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1093
00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:32.763
<v Speaker 2>because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has this view of what cultural </v>

1094
00:57:35.021 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 2>evolution is that it's independent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>genes.</v>

1095
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I say it is actually much more flexible </v>
<v Speaker 2>than jeans,</v>

1096
00:57:40.751 --> 00:57:43.750
<v Speaker 2>but it is subordinate to the will of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes.</v>

1097
00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he also does not subscribe.</v>

1098
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:49.503
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came around a bit on this on stage I </v>

1099
00:57:51.491 --> 00:57:52.690
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1100
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 2>but he also does not subscribe to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1101
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.270
<v Speaker 2>a lineage level interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection.</v>

1102
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:02.223
<v Speaker 2>He is a traditional Ken selectionist who</v>
<v Speaker 2>believes effectively that the </v>

1103
00:58:06.701 --> 00:58:08.980
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the gene and the individual are the</v>

1104
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:12.160
<v Speaker 2>places that we must interpret a </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution.</v>

1105
00:58:12.161 --> 00:58:16.090
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then lots of things are paradoxical,</v>

1106
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.190
<v Speaker 2>hard to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe intractable,</v>

1107
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.680
<v Speaker 2>if you accept that lineages evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1108
00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.230
<v Speaker 2>that adaptation can apply to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lineage,</v>

1109
00:58:26.290 --> 00:58:31.290
<v Speaker 2>then you can begin to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena like a religious traditions as</v>

1110
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:37.020
<v Speaker 2>adaptive properties of a population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1111
00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:39.003
<v Speaker 2>there is tremendous progress to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened on stage with Dawkins </v>

1112
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:48.270
<v Speaker 2>was at dinner prior to the event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we more or less agreed that I would lead</v>

1113
00:58:50.561 --> 00:58:55.540
<v Speaker 2>the discussion because I had a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we disagreed and he would react to</v>

1114
00:58:55.541 --> 00:58:56.374
<v Speaker 2>it and I put together a list of points </v>
<v Speaker 2>on which I was certain that we agreed </v>

1115
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:05.470
<v Speaker 2>points on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I was pretty sure we disagreed and</v>

1116
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.510
<v Speaker 2>points on which I wasn't sure which way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to call it,</v>

1117
00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:08.530
<v Speaker 2>which we didn't get to.</v>

1118
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.113
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started out by pointing out the vast </v>

1119
00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:12.663
<v Speaker 2>agreement between the two of us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked them about each one and more or </v>

1120
00:59:15.971 --> 00:59:17.740
<v Speaker 2>less I had been right about where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreed.</v>

1121
00:59:17.741 --> 00:59:20.650
<v Speaker 2>And then I started to go through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>list of places that we disagree.</v>

1122
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:24.560
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was a fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

1123
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:29.800
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely a closer to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation I hoped we would have won.</v>

1124
00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I feared we might have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1125
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.040
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you,</v>

1126
00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:35.923
<v Speaker 2>could you sense which way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that this matters in the grand </v>

1127
00:59:38.181 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 2>scheme of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at,</v>

1128
00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:42.740
<v Speaker 2>at some level it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which way the audience was going,</v>

1129
00:59:42.741 --> 00:59:43.574
<v Speaker 2>not that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that it is about who gets more </v>

1130
00:59:44.961 --> 00:59:45.794
<v Speaker 2>cheers or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I do find fascinating about </v>

1131
00:59:47.991 --> 00:59:48.824
<v Speaker 2>these things and although I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>attend any of the live events with Sam </v>

1132
00:59:51.181 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 2>and Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1133
00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:53.084
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched some of them and just sort </v>

1134
00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:55.004
<v Speaker 2>of noting a little bit of crowd applause</v>
<v Speaker 2>and jeers and pauses and things I think </v>

1135
00:59:59.301 --> 01:00:03.470
<v Speaker 2>gives you some extra taste that may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you guys on stage.</v>

1136
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:07.220
<v Speaker 2>You can't quite quantify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1137
01:00:07.221 --> 01:00:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1138
01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:09.314
<v Speaker 2>I'm a believer in that and it was one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important tools that I used to </v>

1139
01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:15.160
<v Speaker 2>use in the classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1140
01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.740
<v Speaker 2>figuring out what people heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it landed,</v>

1141
01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.190
<v Speaker 2>what they don't yet have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1142
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:25.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm very cognizant of what people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing and I was listening carefully to</v>

1143
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.360
<v Speaker 2>the audience and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1144
01:00:29.361 --> 01:00:32.510
<v Speaker 2>the thing was set in motion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1145
01:00:32.511 --> 01:00:36.020
<v Speaker 2>as another new atheist event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in some sense I was,</v>

1146
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:40.760
<v Speaker 2>I was battling uphill because my basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>point was new atheism is,</v>

1147
01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.140
<v Speaker 2>is a Culdesac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1148
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:47.170
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem because at the end,</v>

1149
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:50.000
<v Speaker 2>at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't enough.</v>

1150
01:00:50.001 --> 01:00:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Is that like the most simplistic way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I could present it?</v>

1151
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:53.563
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1152
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:58.580
<v Speaker 2>let me just put it in stark terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atheism is defensible,</v>

1153
01:00:58.820 --> 01:00:59.653
<v Speaker 2>but new atheism is wrong and new atheism</v>
<v Speaker 2>is wrong because it portrays religious </v>

1154
01:01:05.571 --> 01:01:06.404
<v Speaker 2>belief as a defect of mine rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>an adaptation and non literal </v>

1155
01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:12.584
<v Speaker 2>adaptation.</v>

1156
01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:17.780
<v Speaker 2>And so in a room full of people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1157
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Dawkins is a very famous person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people presumably showed up to hear</v>

1158
01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.950
<v Speaker 2>a Dawkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost all of those people have at least</v>

1159
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.560
<v Speaker 2>deep sympathies with the ideas of new </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheism.</v>

1160
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:31.873
<v Speaker 2>And so somebody setting out to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually new atheism is an incorrect </v>

1161
01:01:36.681 --> 01:01:37.514
<v Speaker 2>instantiation of atheism because it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively ideological and it accuses </v>

1162
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:46.940
<v Speaker 2>people who have religious faith of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally defective.</v>

1163
01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:50.030
<v Speaker 2>And in fact Dawkins and I tangled over </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1164
01:01:50.031 --> 01:01:50.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1165
01:01:50.571 --> 01:01:51.380
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1166
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.640
<v Speaker 2>you've called religion a mind virus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an incorrect interpretation.</v>

1167
01:01:55.641 --> 01:01:56.480
<v Speaker 2>And at first he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1168
01:01:56.481 --> 01:01:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't really mean anything deep by </v>
<v Speaker 2>virus.</v>

1169
01:01:58.821 --> 01:01:59.654
<v Speaker 2>He said it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1170
01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:02.450
<v Speaker 2>you could argue that every gene in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>genome is like a virus,</v>

1171
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1172
01:02:04.281 --> 01:02:05.114
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what people hear when you say that </v>

1173
01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:07.693
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're mentally ill for believing </v>

1174
01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:09.920
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1175
01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.281
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1176
01:02:10.281 --> 01:02:11.840
<v Speaker 2>they are mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1177
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.521
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1178
01:02:12.521 --> 01:02:14.810
<v Speaker 2>you could see the division in his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

1179
01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're at that point,</v>

1180
01:02:16.011 --> 01:02:18.560
<v Speaker 2>he's then saying both things at the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>time saying both things.</v>

1181
01:02:18.561 --> 01:02:19.394
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1182
01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:20.723
<v Speaker 2>I understand his position about you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could interpret each gene as </v>

1183
01:02:23.431 --> 01:02:24.460
<v Speaker 2>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1184
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.433
<v Speaker 2>I could defend that position too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in order for there to be an </v>

1185
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:31.583
<v Speaker 2>honorable atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to own up to what all that </v>

1186
01:02:34.771 --> 01:02:37.350
<v Speaker 2>religious belief was about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1187
01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the place that I get into an</v>

1188
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:44.220
<v Speaker 2>easier pickle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pickle with Peterson as well,</v>

1189
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:49.700
<v Speaker 2>is the question of if we acknowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>that religious belief is adaptive,</v>

1190
01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:56.123
<v Speaker 2>then all of the things that are true of </v>
<v Speaker 2>adaptive phenomena kick in and the most </v>

1191
01:03:00.121 --> 01:03:03.930
<v Speaker 2>important one is that adaptive phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not timeless.</v>

1192
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:08.550
<v Speaker 2>They are adaptive relative to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical time and place.</v>

1193
01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 2>And it may be a very long standing time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and place.</v>

1194
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.930
<v Speaker 2>But the point is there is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is purely magical thinking to imagine</v>

1195
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:17.063
<v Speaker 2>that religious traditions that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years old are the core of </v>

1196
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.770
<v Speaker 2>the toolkit for moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our,</v>

1197
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:29.890
<v Speaker 2>our existence in 2018 is so novel that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's one thing we can be sure of,</v>

1198
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:33.610
<v Speaker 2>it's that are adaptive nature is a poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>match for it.</v>

1199
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:38.580
<v Speaker 2>So then can anything be truly timeless?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the right question?</v>

1200
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1201
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:44.490
<v Speaker 2>but the way you do it is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the longer standing,</v>

1202
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:49.670
<v Speaker 2>some truth of some kind is the closer it</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets to being timeless.</v>

1203
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:52.890
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we look at things that are,</v>

1204
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:55.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very evolutionarily longstanding,</v>

1205
01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:57.683
<v Speaker 2>well those things have persisted through</v>
<v Speaker 2>environments that were very different </v>

1206
01:04:01.111 --> 01:04:01.944
<v Speaker 2>from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that thread still </v>

1207
01:04:04.171 --> 01:04:07.590
<v Speaker 2>functions irrespective to an extent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the context.</v>

1208
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.460
<v Speaker 2>The longer it lasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more likely it is to speak to truths</v>

1209
01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:14.270
<v Speaker 2>that continue to be relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1210
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:15.263
<v Speaker 2>the bitter pill for modern people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect to understanding the degree to </v>

1211
01:04:21.451 --> 01:04:22.284
<v Speaker 2>which evolution is the key to seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves properly is that we live in </v>

1212
01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:36.140
<v Speaker 2>circumstances that are more novel than </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost any creature has ever faced.</v>

1213
01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1214
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.393
<v Speaker 2>a creature can fished and flop into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boat and it's suddenly a novel </v>

1215
01:04:42.001 --> 01:04:43.770
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and it's dead within </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

1216
01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:44.623
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell that to the dinosaurs in the </v>

1217
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.210
<v Speaker 2>media was going well there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1218
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:49.320
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was so novel that you know,</v>

1219
01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean dinosaurs didn't survive that one</v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

1220
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.500
<v Speaker 2>The birds are still with us and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing great,</v>

1221
01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:02.150
<v Speaker 2>but we are creatures living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances that are not only novel at</v>

1222
01:05:03.601 --> 01:05:08.370
<v Speaker 2>an unprecedented level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are changing so rapidly that even to</v>

1223
01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:10.560
<v Speaker 2>the extent that we can figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

1224
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:14.940
<v Speaker 2>the world changes out from under us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to stop that right?</v>

1225
01:05:14.941 --> 01:05:15.774
<v Speaker 2>That is going to kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That if you want to know what the </v>

1226
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:21.220
<v Speaker 2>greatest existential threat to humanity </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1227
01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:22.373
<v Speaker 2>it is the rate of change that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>set in motion which makes it impossible </v>

1228
01:05:25.781 --> 01:05:29.680
<v Speaker 2>for us to adapt fast enough to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be slowed down to a point that</v>

1229
01:05:29.681 --> 01:05:30.400
<v Speaker 2>we can catch up.</v>

1230
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.233
<v Speaker 1>Is that impossible though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we already have that power </v>

1231
01:05:34.141 --> 01:05:37.980
<v Speaker 1>because I'm with you on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just from my limited knowledge of this,</v>

1232
01:05:37.981 --> 01:05:41.580
<v Speaker 1>just from what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know from doing these shows and that</v>

1233
01:05:41.581 --> 01:05:42.414
<v Speaker 1>people can watch more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the amount of information that </v>

1234
01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:47.400
<v Speaker 1>you can intake on a given day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of things that you can share.</v>

1235
01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.430
<v Speaker 1>You can speed things up and listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them two times as fast.</v>

1236
01:05:50.431 --> 01:05:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You can clip everything and that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take all of this information.</v>

1237
01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Things can be live streamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this,</v>

1238
01:05:55.711 --> 01:05:56.101
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

1239
01:05:56.101 --> 01:05:56.401
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

1240
01:05:56.401 --> 01:05:56.761
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

1241
01:05:56.761 --> 01:05:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening faster.</v>

1242
01:05:57.931 --> 01:05:59.460
<v Speaker 1>We're learning more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know there's a great</v>

1243
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 2>thirst for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1244
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.320
<v Speaker 2>but can it be slowed down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1245
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:06.763
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what force could slow down progress </v>

1246
01:06:08.981 --> 01:06:10.790
<v Speaker 2>really wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1247
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:12.123
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

1248
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.700
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1249
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:19.060
<v Speaker 2>We are children in this landscape and </v>
<v Speaker 2>children grow up,</v>

1250
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:20.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1251
01:06:20.381 --> 01:06:24.450
<v Speaker 2>the key to raising children properly is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1252
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.353
<v Speaker 2>is to back off the things that protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>them enough that they actually get </v>

1253
01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:33.370
<v Speaker 2>burned without being burned so severely </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're crippled.</v>

1254
01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.273
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to experience the places that </v>

1255
01:06:36.881 --> 01:06:40.150
<v Speaker 2>your notions are naive in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become less night.</v>

1256
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.900
<v Speaker 2>We are now in a situation in which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are behaving in a childlike fashion in,</v>

1257
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very,</v>

1258
01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:51.130
<v Speaker 2>in a foundry or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1259
01:06:51.131 --> 01:06:52.810
<v Speaker 2>We're like children running around in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the foundry.</v>

1260
01:06:52.811 --> 01:06:57.310
<v Speaker 2>There's molten metal that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to recognize it,</v>

1261
01:06:57.311 --> 01:06:57.920
<v Speaker 2>how not to.</v>

1262
01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:01.660
<v Speaker 1>We were just pressing every button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buttons are cool.</v>

1263
01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1264
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:05.280
<v Speaker 2>we got to stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

1265
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:07.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm to be candid about it,</v>

1266
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:12.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we are in an unrecoverable</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

1267
01:07:12.271 --> 01:07:17.130
<v Speaker 2>I can see the path forward and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>still plausible as far as I know,</v>

1268
01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.413
<v Speaker 2>but I'm worried that we won't get there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason we won't get there is </v>

1269
01:07:21.151 --> 01:07:25.350
<v Speaker 2>that there are lots of things that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been true that just aren't true anymore.</v>

1270
01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:28.740
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are in love with,</v>

1271
01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a limitless market in which you can do </v>

1272
01:07:31.411 --> 01:07:33.930
<v Speaker 2>anything that you can manage and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>all cool.</v>

1273
01:07:33.931 --> 01:07:36.780
<v Speaker 2>And then at the point we find out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't cool.</v>

1274
01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.570
<v Speaker 2>We might have to take some action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the meantime,</v>

1275
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:40.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1276
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:43.650
<v Speaker 2>you're free to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very sympathetic to this view,</v>

1277
01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.580
<v Speaker 2>as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1278
01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.653
<v Speaker 2>I would be sympathetic to this view if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't recognize that there was a </v>

1279
01:07:48.841 --> 01:07:51.240
<v Speaker 2>problem in which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1280
01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:52.403
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the way our economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is hooked up to our political </v>

1281
01:07:56.521 --> 01:07:59.310
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a problem where anytime you set</v>

1282
01:07:59.311 --> 01:08:04.311
<v Speaker 2>a new force in motion in the market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that force pays at a high rate in the</v>

1283
01:08:05.371 --> 01:08:06.204
<v Speaker 2>short term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it costs at a high rate in the </v>

1284
01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.073
<v Speaker 2>longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time you get around to </v>

1285
01:08:10.171 --> 01:08:11.004
<v Speaker 2>discovering the costs in the long term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has found its way into the political </v>

1286
01:08:14.371 --> 01:08:15.940
<v Speaker 2>system so that it cannot be reversed.</v>

1287
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:18.380
<v Speaker 2>And you can't have a system in which you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't reverse them.</v>

1288
01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:19.283
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the simplest way to frame this would be </v>

1289
01:08:20.581 --> 01:08:22.380
<v Speaker 1>some sort of crony capitalism kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1290
01:08:22.381 --> 01:08:23.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1291
01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

1292
01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:29.640
<v Speaker 1>we're not truly free market because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've politicized competition basically.</v>

1293
01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:31.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1294
01:08:31.081 --> 01:08:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I tried to look at everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1295
01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.780
<v Speaker 2>through an evolutionary lens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>

1296
01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:39.040
<v Speaker 2>politics and economics are just one more</v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape.</v>

1297
01:08:39.041 --> 01:08:44.041
<v Speaker 2>And they're interesting because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans and humans are especially capable</v>

1298
01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.530
<v Speaker 2>in this regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

1299
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the natural tendency for a creature that</v>

1300
01:08:53.771 --> 01:08:58.771
<v Speaker 2>has found its way into a niche is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect its access to that niche.</v>

1301
01:08:59.050 --> 01:09:02.950
<v Speaker 2>And the way creatures do that is they </v>
<v Speaker 2>freeze other creatures out.</v>

1302
01:09:02.951 --> 01:09:05.710
<v Speaker 2>So there is this natural pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1303
01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I can't not see it now that I now that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understood that it exists.</v>

1304
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:15.160
<v Speaker 2>There's this natural pattern where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>upstarts who succeed,</v>

1305
01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:19.270
<v Speaker 2>the stories that we know we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the upstarts that failed mostly,</v>

1306
01:09:19.271 --> 01:09:22.990
<v Speaker 2>but you have startups that succeed end </v>
<v Speaker 2>up tremendously powerful.</v>

1307
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:24.303
<v Speaker 2>And then they go through this process in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they become hostile to upstart </v>

1308
01:09:28.811 --> 01:09:29.644
<v Speaker 2>newness and they become hostile to </v>
<v Speaker 2>upstart and us for the most natural of </v>

1309
01:09:32.261 --> 01:09:33.094
<v Speaker 2>reasons which is that their wellbeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>depends on shutting down the process </v>

1310
01:09:36.701 --> 01:09:38.140
<v Speaker 2>through which they became successful.</v>

1311
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:42.140
<v Speaker 1>So this could be like facebook buying </v>
<v Speaker 1>all their competitors and things of that</v>

1312
01:09:42.141 --> 01:09:42.620
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

1313
01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.720
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way,</v>

1314
01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:45.554
<v Speaker 2>there are obvious versions and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are innumerable versions that are </v>

1315
01:09:49.371 --> 01:09:50.204
<v Speaker 2>cryptic and we were never going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the whole landscape of ways </v>

1316
01:09:53.511 --> 01:09:54.344
<v Speaker 2>in which those who have reached this </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of power that you and I will only </v>

1317
01:09:57.951 --> 01:10:01.010
<v Speaker 2>dream about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they will then shut down the access</v>

1318
01:10:01.011 --> 01:10:02.810
<v Speaker 2>to others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a,</v>

1319
01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:04.503
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to call it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy because it doesn't have to </v>

1320
01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:10.820
<v Speaker 2>have any consciousness to it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a tendency for,</v>

1321
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.983
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for those who have succeeded to shut </v>

1322
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:18.250
<v Speaker 2>down the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mechanism through which they see.</v>

1323
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.093
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see this with a people </v>

1324
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:22.363
<v Speaker 2>frequently remarking on the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants are often not that wildly </v>

1325
01:10:25.311 --> 01:10:28.580
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic about further immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

1326
01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.800
<v Speaker 2>For obvious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1327
01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:31.634
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about do people who've </v>
<v Speaker 2>just entered at the bottom of the </v>

1328
01:10:33.741 --> 01:10:36.230
<v Speaker 2>economic ladder want more competition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1329
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.903
<v Speaker 2>they're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a tension between what </v>

1330
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:40.813
<v Speaker 2>people should want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you shouldn't imagine that there's </v>

1331
01:10:42.081 --> 01:10:42.914
<v Speaker 2>some immigrant ness that necessarily has</v>
<v Speaker 2>you favorable to anybody else who has </v>

1332
01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:47.740
<v Speaker 2>that label.</v>

1333
01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:48.573
<v Speaker 1>Does this also sort of explain a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of what's happening in the tech </v>

1334
01:10:50.831 --> 01:10:54.280
<v Speaker 1>world right now in terms of it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these companies,</v>

1335
01:10:54.281 --> 01:10:55.091
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

1336
01:10:55.091 --> 01:10:55.924
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are potentially at least using </v>

1337
01:10:58.091 --> 01:11:01.930
<v Speaker 1>algorithms against their own audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shadow banning people.</v>

1338
01:11:01.931 --> 01:11:06.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean that they are basically now </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning against their own people because</v>

1339
01:11:07.181 --> 01:11:09.700
<v Speaker 1>of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they perceive to be their own,</v>

1340
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:12.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protection or longterm health.</v>

1341
01:11:12.341 --> 01:11:13.174
<v Speaker 1>Even though I would argue in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not really what's going to </v>

1342
01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:16.614
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1343
01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:19.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without question.</v>

1344
01:11:19.251 --> 01:11:22.760
<v Speaker 2>This is what's going on and let's put it</v>
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>

1345
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:25.640
<v Speaker 2>If you're at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in that strata,</v>

1346
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:30.170
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot to lose through anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't predict.</v>

1347
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:31.303
<v Speaker 2>And so there is a way in which we expect</v>
<v Speaker 2>the upstart who got there through some </v>

1348
01:11:38.541 --> 01:11:39.374
<v Speaker 2>sort of radical transformation to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>favorable to route a radical </v>

1349
01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:42.764
<v Speaker 2>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the way we should understand it is </v>

1350
01:11:44.241 --> 01:11:45.074
<v Speaker 2>that once you've gotten there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical transformation becomes </v>

1351
01:11:47.241 --> 01:11:48.074
<v Speaker 2>threatening and you start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatizing evolutionary force and </v>

1352
01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:54.483
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can look at what twitter is playing </v>

1353
01:11:56.151 --> 01:12:01.151
<v Speaker 2>with these days with the potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminating like some follower counts.</v>

1354
01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a breathtaking act of paternalism,</v>

1355
01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at best and are doing it for us,</v>

1356
01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:09.951
<v Speaker 2>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1357
01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Because we shouldn't be so concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>about who's paying attention.</v>

1358
01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:16.930
<v Speaker 2>But really the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as we all recognize that there's</v>

1359
01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.600
<v Speaker 2>a problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1360
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:23.600
<v Speaker 2>tweeting to get trivial likes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>

1361
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:28.790
<v Speaker 2>understanding what your audience hears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they find favorable,</v>

1362
01:12:28.791 --> 01:12:32.870
<v Speaker 2>what doesn't ring true to them is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way you learn,</v>

1363
01:12:32.871 --> 01:12:33.704
<v Speaker 2>it's the way you steer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so effectively twitter is playing </v>

1364
01:12:36.831 --> 01:12:40.970
<v Speaker 2>with blinding us so that we can say </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we want into the void,</v>

1365
01:12:40.971 --> 01:12:44.780
<v Speaker 2>but we have no idea how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no ping back to you basically.</v>

1366
01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.440
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1367
01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to tell you,</v>

1368
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:49.400
<v Speaker 2>you're a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're standing in front of the room and</v>

1369
01:12:49.401 --> 01:12:50.050
<v Speaker 2>you get</v>

1370
01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:52.210
<v Speaker 1>a lot better when they laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better,</v>

1371
01:12:52.211 --> 01:12:53.790
<v Speaker 1>it's better when they laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1372
01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:54.970
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1373
01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should we be thinking?</v>

1374
01:12:58.150 --> 01:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before I get to that.</v>

1375
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.570
<v Speaker 1>So as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just in a,</v>

1376
01:13:01.571 --> 01:13:02.404
<v Speaker 1>in Europe and I did a bunch of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian and Nordic countries and </v>

1377
01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:06.573
<v Speaker 1>Sweden was a particularly interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>case because I know that our fifth most </v>

1378
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:13.750
<v Speaker 1>viewed country for this show is Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of fascinating considering</v>

1379
01:13:13.751 --> 01:13:15.430
<v Speaker 1>how tiny Sweden is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1380
01:13:15.431 --> 01:13:16.264
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of circled that we did two shows </v>

1381
01:13:17.741 --> 01:13:18.574
<v Speaker 1>in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of circled them on the calendar </v>

1382
01:13:19.901 --> 01:13:21.940
<v Speaker 1>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's going on in Sweden.</v>

1383
01:13:21.941 --> 01:13:22.774
<v Speaker 1>I want to figure out what it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought if you would have asked me </v>

1384
01:13:25.061 --> 01:13:25.894
<v Speaker 1>before I did the show that first night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was gonna have a lot to do </v>

1385
01:13:28.361 --> 01:13:29.194
<v Speaker 1>with immigration.</v>

1386
01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:30.813
<v Speaker 1>What I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although there were a lot of questions </v>

1387
01:13:31.931 --> 01:13:33.780
<v Speaker 1>about immigration at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1388
01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:34.653
<v Speaker 1>it had much more to do with gender and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is happening to their highly </v>

1389
01:13:39.551 --> 01:13:44.551
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian society that have done most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things related to gender and true</v>

1390
01:13:44.951 --> 01:13:47.290
<v Speaker 1>equality correctly for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years.</v>

1391
01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.273
<v Speaker 1>And all of our friends on the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>always point to Sweden and Norway and </v>

1392
01:13:50.981 --> 01:13:51.814
<v Speaker 1>Finland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These countries that I was just at as </v>

1393
01:13:52.601 --> 01:13:53.434
<v Speaker 1>the examples of their perfect societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're really struggling with </v>

1394
01:13:57.251 --> 01:13:58.084
<v Speaker 1>certain things that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the government is forcing them to </v>

1395
01:13:59.591 --> 01:14:02.150
<v Speaker 1>have genderless kindergartens and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1396
01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:03.043
<v Speaker 1>the emasculation of men and the removal </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the father and that they have </v>

1397
01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:11.110
<v Speaker 1>supposedly Europe's first feminist </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and all of these.</v>

1398
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.993
<v Speaker 1>So I thought as long as I have you here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and since gender seems to be such an </v>

1399
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:21.360
<v Speaker 1>endlessly a provocative and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>misunderstood topic,</v>

1400
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:26.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should we do on gender right now?</v>

1401
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1402
01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:29.283
<v Speaker 1>well beyond you go to Sweden and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what's going on here </v>

1403
01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:32.290
<v Speaker 1>because something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1404
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:36.010
<v Speaker 1>what it struck me as is that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done everything right in effect in terms</v>

1405
01:14:36.011 --> 01:14:38.230
<v Speaker 1>of egalitarianism and they've done it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1406
01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:40.300
<v Speaker 1>for decades now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done it right.</v>

1407
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.830
<v Speaker 1>And when they got to the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is now,</v>

1408
01:14:42.831 --> 01:14:43.664
<v Speaker 1>and they got to the current day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized that despite all of this </v>

1409
01:14:46.511 --> 01:14:48.640
<v Speaker 1>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women are still different.</v>

1410
01:14:48.641 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 1>That women still care more about people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and men still care more about things.</v>

1411
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:56.230
<v Speaker 1>So even though they've been given the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact same opportunity,</v>

1412
01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:57.513
<v Speaker 1>women are still becoming nurses and men </v>
<v Speaker 1>are still becoming engineers and it's </v>

1413
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:04.540
<v Speaker 1>like the social justice warriors or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call that crew,</v>

1414
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:08.230
<v Speaker 1>they still don't like the results of </v>
<v Speaker 1>true equality.</v>

1415
01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:11.950
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's why Sweden's in such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird place,</v>

1416
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:13.390
<v Speaker 1>the average person's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1417
01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:15.490
<v Speaker 1>We've done it right when we did it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1418
01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever we want,</v>

1419
01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:20.920
<v Speaker 1>but then the result isn't being allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be accepted.</v>

1420
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that make some sense?</v>

1421
01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes perfect sense.</v>

1422
01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1423
01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:25.643
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1424
01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:31.700
<v Speaker 2>the naive left finds the failure of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis absolutely galling.</v>

1425
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.863
<v Speaker 2>And so they're effectively trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>erase that failure by hard coding the </v>

1426
01:15:40.321 --> 01:15:41.460
<v Speaker 2>solution into government.</v>

1427
01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.620
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's exactly what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening happening</v>

1428
01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:44.453
<v Speaker 2>in Sweden right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's tragic and with respect to sex </v>

1429
01:15:47.581 --> 01:15:49.710
<v Speaker 2>and gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is so needless,</v>

1430
01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:50.783
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact is the truth of sex and gender </v>

1431
01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:53.723
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are parts of it we don't fully </v>

1432
01:15:55.351 --> 01:15:57.360
<v Speaker 2>understand yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in general,</v>

1433
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:58.343
<v Speaker 2>actually we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We pretty much understand how we got </v>

1434
01:16:00.601 --> 01:16:05.601
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the truth is it is asymmetrical.</v>

1435
01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.173
<v Speaker 2>It is a complimentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth of male and female is a </v>

1436
01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:13.983
<v Speaker 2>complimentary truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be largely irrelevant in the </v>

1437
01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:18.780
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1438
01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:20.243
<v Speaker 2>technology has eliminated most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis on which the division of labor </v>

1439
01:16:24.271 --> 01:16:25.104
<v Speaker 2>between men and women initially evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think we have actually an </v>

1440
01:16:28.561 --> 01:16:33.310
<v Speaker 2>opportunity here to become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to behave in an enlightened fashion that</v>

1441
01:16:33.311 --> 01:16:36.720
<v Speaker 2>the the easiest place to solve this </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is sex and gender.</v>

1442
01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:37.853
<v Speaker 2>What we should do is pretty clear and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not hard to ground and evolutionary </v>

1443
01:16:43.021 --> 01:16:48.000
<v Speaker 2>theory because unlike other places like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a race for example,</v>

1444
01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:52.420
<v Speaker 2>we do know what to think with respect to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex and gender and the.</v>

1445
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.273
<v Speaker 2>The basic outline is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men and women are different for </v>

1446
01:16:55.441 --> 01:16:56.274
<v Speaker 2>historical reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The basis for that difference and the </v>

1447
01:16:59.701 --> 01:17:04.701
<v Speaker 2>utility of that difference has largely </v>
<v Speaker 2>been neutralized by the modern world.</v>

1448
01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:11.270
<v Speaker 2>We don't need to retain those </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinctions,</v>

1449
01:17:11.271 --> 01:17:15.440
<v Speaker 2>but some of those distinctions are built</v>
<v Speaker 2>in at a deeper level than others.</v>

1450
01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.333
<v Speaker 2>So meaning you could potentially be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay at home dad and that could be </v>

1451
01:17:18.621 --> 01:17:19.454
<v Speaker 2>perfectly fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that probably for evolutionary </v>

1452
01:17:21.891 --> 01:17:25.600
<v Speaker 2>reasons is not going to be the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that usually happens,</v>

1453
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's my point.</v>

1454
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:30.223
<v Speaker 2>We can democratize access to almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything with respect to sex and </v>

1455
01:17:35.871 --> 01:17:36.704
<v Speaker 2>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are very few places where we </v>

1456
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.010
<v Speaker 2>actually need to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1457
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:44.690
<v Speaker 2>some asymmetry in access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but probably,</v>

1458
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the firefighter who comes into the </v>

1459
01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:49.034
<v Speaker 2>burning building through the roof to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull you out when you're panicking and </v>

1460
01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.560
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to do because you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>never been in a fire before.</v>

1461
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on average,</v>

1462
01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:59.030
<v Speaker 2>that should probably be a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just better built for it.</v>

1463
01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:03.170
<v Speaker 2>If there's a woman who is well enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do it,</v>

1464
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:04.123
<v Speaker 2>should you be picky about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>firefighter who plucks you out of the </v>

1465
01:18:06.231 --> 01:18:07.640
<v Speaker 2>burning building?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>

1466
01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally am thrilled to see it every</v>

1467
01:18:10.521 --> 01:18:13.100
<v Speaker 2>time it runs against the narrative that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we expect.</v>

1468
01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1469
01:18:14.301 --> 01:18:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1470
01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm very fond of Stacey Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1471
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 2>the police chief at Evergreen who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>driven out along with heather and me.</v>

1472
01:18:21.981 --> 01:18:26.210
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was great that she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>female and that she was a,</v>

1473
01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.800
<v Speaker 2>an excellent cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

1474
01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm up for the narrative being broken </v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

1475
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.970
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1476
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:37.370
<v Speaker 2>by reality as often as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you democratize the access,</v>

1477
01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:42.260
<v Speaker 2>but you don't force people to do what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they otherwise would for one thing,</v>

1478
01:18:42.261 --> 01:18:46.460
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't even want to force it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because for every job that you would,</v>

1479
01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:50.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>force women into it some higher rate,</v>

1480
01:18:50.691 --> 01:18:53.840
<v Speaker 2>let's say engineering jobs because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds like a good thing to do.</v>

1481
01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.793
<v Speaker 2>There's some awful job that men are </v>
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately represented in that </v>

1482
01:18:57.771 --> 01:19:00.260
<v Speaker 2>you would also have to force them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be fair.</v>

1483
01:19:00.261 --> 01:19:05.120
<v Speaker 2>So you democratize the access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You recognize that the division of Labor</v>

1484
01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:05.983
<v Speaker 2>that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have inherited is largely </v>

1485
01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:09.270
<v Speaker 2>outdated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1486
01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.860
<v Speaker 2>but you don't a override people's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1487
01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.510
<v Speaker 2>show me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1488
01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.070
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if women,</v>

1489
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:17.293
<v Speaker 2>if you democratize access to engineering</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly and women go into it at equal </v>

1490
01:19:22.161 --> 01:19:23.300
<v Speaker 2>rates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1491
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:26.090
<v Speaker 2>If they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool too.</v>

1492
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in any case,</v>

1493
01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:28.964
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a question of allowing liberty to </v>

1494
01:19:31.311 --> 01:19:36.020
<v Speaker 2>decide where people go after you've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>away with not barrier.</v>

1495
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting because I think then</v>

1496
01:19:37.461 --> 01:19:39.280
<v Speaker 2>you hit it right on the head that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1497
01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:40.173
<v Speaker 2>Sweden's now politicizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're making a point of making this </v>

1498
01:19:42.321 --> 01:19:43.154
<v Speaker 2>political because they will not accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>the science of what they've done </v>

1499
01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:49.880
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that is what is,</v>

1500
01:19:49.881 --> 01:19:54.080
<v Speaker 2>what is lead this sort of average person</v>
<v Speaker 2>there to go this,</v>

1501
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:55.760
<v Speaker 2>this is just not right.</v>

1502
01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:56.713
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the way out is and I </v>

1503
01:19:58.191 --> 01:20:00.320
<v Speaker 2>sense that most of the people there </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know at the way I was.</v>

1504
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:01.183
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the way out really is to </v>

1505
01:20:03.261 --> 01:20:04.094
<v Speaker 2>recognize that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ire of the authoritarian left on </v>

1506
01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:12.630
<v Speaker 2>this point is actually indicative of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole problem.</v>

1507
01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:14.063
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because sex and gender is more or less </v>

1508
01:20:16.171 --> 01:20:21.171
<v Speaker 2>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the desire to erase it,</v>

1509
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:26.990
<v Speaker 2>irrespective of the collateral damage is</v>
<v Speaker 2>an indicator of just how wrong this path</v>

1510
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:30.150
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1511
01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find this all the time where people </v>

1512
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.863
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not focused on biology and </v>

1513
01:20:37.141 --> 01:20:40.620
<v Speaker 2>you're focused on the world that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>find in your galled by,</v>

1514
01:20:41.010 --> 01:20:43.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by inequality,</v>

1515
01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:44.603
<v Speaker 2>then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1516
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.340
<v Speaker 2>let's just solve the inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is hard code the solution,</v>

1517
01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:52.590
<v Speaker 2>but then you hard code the solution and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it says men and women of the same to the</v>

1518
01:20:52.591 --> 01:20:55.320
<v Speaker 2>extent that there's any difference in </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they choose to do,</v>

1519
01:20:55.321 --> 01:20:56.154
<v Speaker 2>that's the result of a either cryptic </v>
<v Speaker 2>barriers or internalized misogyny or </v>

1520
01:21:01.381 --> 01:21:02.214
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the problem is you're now </v>

1521
01:21:04.411 --> 01:21:06.130
<v Speaker 2>interfering with my biology class.</v>

1522
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:07.103
<v Speaker 2>You're now telling me that we that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>received wisdom is that men and women </v>

1523
01:21:10.231 --> 01:21:11.064
<v Speaker 2>are the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I know damn well that can't be </v>

1524
01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:13.164
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't want to build a solution </v>

1525
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:18.390
<v Speaker 2>that forces you to confront your </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologists,</v>

1526
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:20.490
<v Speaker 2>physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your statisticians,</v>

1527
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.713
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want all of these stories to the </v>

1528
01:21:24.061 --> 01:21:27.690
<v Speaker 2>extent that they're true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to reconcile all true stories,</v>

1529
01:21:27.691 --> 01:21:28.524
<v Speaker 2>records to the extent that you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>naive notion over here and you want to </v>

1530
01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:33.773
<v Speaker 2>just write it in because it seems very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important to you and you're willing to </v>

1531
01:21:35.671 --> 01:21:38.010
<v Speaker 2>tolerate all of the cascading effects </v>
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere.</v>

1532
01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't belong in a position of power.</v>

1533
01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:41.843
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those people are in a position </v>

1534
01:21:43.571 --> 01:21:44.404
<v Speaker 1>to power and I think we're seeing more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them get into positions of power and </v>

1535
01:21:46.981 --> 01:21:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also now having a counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect in Europe,</v>

1536
01:21:49.681 --> 01:21:50.514
<v Speaker 1>which is why we're seeing the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>more far right parties because people </v>

1537
01:21:53.311 --> 01:21:55.650
<v Speaker 1>are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screw this,</v>

1538
01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:58.680
<v Speaker 1>this is so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take my chances over here.</v>

1539
01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.760
<v Speaker 1>People who inherently are not say far </v>
<v Speaker 1>right or certainly not racist,</v>

1540
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:03.803
<v Speaker 1>are now playing with people that perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't have played with before </v>

1541
01:22:06.091 --> 01:22:08.160
<v Speaker 1>because they're so sick of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I.</v>

1542
01:22:08.161 --> 01:22:09.720
<v Speaker 1>and I'm worried where that leads us.</v>

1543
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1544
01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I think this is exact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>

1545
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:14.000
<v Speaker 2>I've heard you say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you were afraid that the,</v>

1546
01:22:14.150 --> 01:22:19.150
<v Speaker 2>the lunacy over on the authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>left is actually going to collapse.</v>

1547
01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:23.720
<v Speaker 2>It's going to leave people who otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't play ball with the far right.</v>

1548
01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over there.</v>

1549
01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not because they're racist.</v>

1550
01:22:27.161 --> 01:22:27.994
<v Speaker 1>That's the key to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they'll suddenly become </v>

1551
01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.590
<v Speaker 1>wake up and be racist or hate women or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate gays,</v>

1552
01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but it will be such a disgust of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality.</v>

1553
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:36.610
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>

1554
01:22:36.610 --> 01:22:39.880
<v Speaker 1>and a rejection of what's provable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'll be like,</v>

1555
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:41.980
<v Speaker 1>at least there's something over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1556
01:22:41.981 --> 01:22:43.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an awful bargain,</v>

1557
01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:45.250
<v Speaker 1>but I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1558
01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I just think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this,</v>

1559
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:50.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently where people,</v>

1560
01:22:50.210 --> 01:22:51.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they detect that there's </v>

1561
01:22:52.881 --> 01:22:57.881
<v Speaker 2>something wrong with communism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialism are often driven,</v>

1562
01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:03.140
<v Speaker 2>right pretty far into the let's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulate anything camp and the answer is</v>

1563
01:23:03.141 --> 01:23:08.141
<v Speaker 2>actually have to regulate stuff just out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a desire to continue as a species.</v>

1564
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.850
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1565
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:10.743
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see people driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's something wrong over </v>

1566
01:23:13.061 --> 01:23:15.040
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people to be driven into,</v>

1567
01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:18.190
<v Speaker 2>into a reactionary position that is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>justified.</v>

1568
01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:23.410
<v Speaker 2>The thing on sex and gender though is </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is the key question.</v>

1569
01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:24.993
<v Speaker 2>Every reasonable person who just simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>observes the world knows that men and </v>

1570
01:23:31.271 --> 01:23:34.210
<v Speaker 2>women are not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know that,</v>

1571
01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those differences have an implication </v>

1572
01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.880
<v Speaker 2>for the way we view all sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like mating and dating,</v>

1573
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:43.900
<v Speaker 2>what careers we want to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we view risk.</v>

1574
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.940
<v Speaker 2>And all of these things for historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

1575
01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.073
<v Speaker 2>All reasonable people can infer that </v>
<v Speaker 2>from their own observations of the </v>

1576
01:23:50.201 --> 01:23:51.034
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are now confronted with people who </v>

1577
01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:57.970
<v Speaker 2>insist that you not acknowledge what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can see.</v>

1578
01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.850
<v Speaker 2>Those people are crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1579
01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.713
<v Speaker 2>They're dangerously out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're dangerously out of control on </v>

1580
01:24:05.181 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 2>other topics where it's harder to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's true,</v>

1581
01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:14.190
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't want people who were so</v>
<v Speaker 2>naive as to argue that men and women are</v>

1582
01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:16.780
<v Speaker 2>effectively identical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for depression,</v>

1583
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:17.913
<v Speaker 2>in charge of any policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want them in charge of </v>

1584
01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:20.940
<v Speaker 2>economic policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in charge of,</v>

1585
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:22.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1586
01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.040
<v Speaker 2>a prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1587
01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.313
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so having seen just how far their </v>

1588
01:24:28.721 --> 01:24:33.721
<v Speaker 2>confusion goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we all agree to shut them out of the</v>

1589
01:24:33.731 --> 01:24:34.564
<v Speaker 2>discussion about how power is to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>wielded and the rest of us can have a </v>

1590
01:24:36.851 --> 01:24:40.150
<v Speaker 2>discussion about what our values are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we think we know,</v>

1591
01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:42.760
<v Speaker 2>what we don't yet know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what its implications are.</v>

1592
01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.500
<v Speaker 2>That that's the place we should go.</v>

1593
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:47.750
<v Speaker 1>That seems like an effective ending </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1594
01:24:47.751 --> 01:24:48.584
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want to throw in one more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we not hit something that's been </v>

1595
01:24:51.321 --> 01:24:53.180
<v Speaker 1>rattling around in your brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1596
01:24:53.181 --> 01:24:56.750
<v Speaker 1>he's a know I covered a lot of territory</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1597
01:24:56.751 --> 01:24:57.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1598
01:24:57.471 --> 01:24:58.304
<v Speaker 1>well it's always a pleasure sitting down</v>
<v Speaker 1>India and you joined me last night for </v>

1599
01:25:00.951 --> 01:25:03.860
<v Speaker 1>standup in Bray California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This'll be up already,</v>

1600
01:25:03.861 --> 01:25:07.670
<v Speaker 1>but you're joining me tonight in Oxnard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm turning you into a standup comic,</v>

1601
01:25:07.671 --> 01:25:09.960
<v Speaker 1>which is a biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worst nightmare.</v>

1602
01:25:09.961 --> 01:25:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
