00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is the milbank family </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers senior fellow at the Hoover </v>

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.691
<v Speaker 1>Institution at Stanford University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a senior fellow at the Center for </v>

3
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>European studies at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he also served as a professor of </v>

4
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 1>history for 12 years as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>author of 14 books.</v>

5
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Neil Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd I do on the intro there?</v>

7
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was looking through your bio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 books.</v>

8
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>There were 87 other things I could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>credited you for.</v>

9
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:37.451
<v Speaker 1>We've already done an interview here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the 15 minutes we've been sitting </v>

10
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:37.451
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was that all right.</v>

11
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:41.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean I could have just made it quicker</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better as my feeling about </v>

12
00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:43.070
<v Speaker 1>introductions just to said he is Neil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

13
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Here's Neil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

14
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton we got to cover here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've already done half of it I think </v>

15
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>without the cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's just dive in immediately to the</v>

16
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:53.840
<v Speaker 1>culture war stuff because I can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been traveling a lot.</v>

17
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Half jet lags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half wide awake,</v>

18
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>but I can see that's really where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head's at at the moment.</v>

19
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk some culture war stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you feel is happening sort of in</v>

20
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>the gestalt of the universe at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment?</v>

21
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>We'll get started with the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be where we should begin since </v>

22
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I've spent a lot of my life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>

23
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:15.950
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Stanford and Harvard.</v>

24
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I was at Oxford before that and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of my life has been,</v>

25
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I think witnessing the gradual </v>
<v Speaker 1>homogenization of academic life,</v>

26
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>especially in the field like history </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I became a historian back in the 19</v>

27
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:36.521
<v Speaker 1>eighties in Oxford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in Cambridge it was generally </v>

28
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:40.961
<v Speaker 1>accepted that that could be conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>historians and liberal historians and </v>

29
00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>socialist historians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some oxys stories.</v>

30
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>It was really quite a heterogeneous </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

31
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Oxbridge in those days.</v>

32
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.980
<v Speaker 1>as I was attracted to the Conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were more fun and it was a,</v>

34
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>either they say more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

35
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>but more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fun was the initially attractive</v>

36
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 1>thing when I first got to Oxford in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early eighties.</v>

37
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>It was clearly at the funniest people </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the riots,</v>

38
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young Andrew Sullivan who was a year</v>

39
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.500
<v Speaker 1>ahead of me at Moreland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this was all great fun and it led to </v>

40
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>insight because they turned out all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of b writes,</v>

42
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 1>the historians take Bob Conquest who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>then at the hoover institution,</v>

43
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.310
<v Speaker 1>one of the few historians who got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union right at the time who wrote</v>

44
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>about Stalin's crimes not long after </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were put up a tracy.</v>

45
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those were the heroes of my early years,</v>

46
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 1>but in the course of my career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has happened has been that one </v>

47
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.661
<v Speaker 1>history department after another has </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved steadily and relentless me to the </v>

48
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:53.231
<v Speaker 1>monochrome left and it has become </v>
<v Speaker 1>steadily harder to be seen as a </v>

49
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:55.370
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>

50
00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I say CNS because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never really felt that I'm a </v>

51
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've often been described as one.</v>

52
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.070
<v Speaker 1>To be seen as a conservative historian </v>
<v Speaker 1>has become steadily harder and harder </v>

53
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.630
<v Speaker 1>and as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but culture war to use your phrase in </v>

54
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>the universities has been won by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

55
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.060
<v Speaker 1>There will really be soon a handful left</v>
<v Speaker 1>of conservatives at institutions like </v>

56
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:24.481
<v Speaker 1>Harvard and Stanford and Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mansfield will probably be the last one </v>

57
00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:25.250
<v Speaker 1>at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

58
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

59
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me deeply depressing,</v>

60
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.960
<v Speaker 1>deeply troubling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember a moment when you saw </v>

61
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.170
<v Speaker 1>that shift occurring because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying in the,</v>

62
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid eighties,</v>

63
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:40.501
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty diverse in terms of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember seeing something or did </v>

64
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:45.331
<v Speaker 1>you see markers that started that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can start putting together the map of </v>

65
00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>where this thing was going to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the definition of defeats in the</v>

66
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:49.880
<v Speaker 1>culture war is that it's imperceptible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your aware of.</v>

68
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit because in a typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>department,</v>

69
00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.600
<v Speaker 1>each year somebody retires or dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're always replaced with </v>

70
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:06.511
<v Speaker 1>somebody working on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say for the sake of argument,</v>

71
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.070
<v Speaker 1>gender history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

72
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.170
<v Speaker 1>you'll colleague was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was lecturing on the history of the </v>

73
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pipes who was at Harvard and a </v>

74
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.920
<v Speaker 1>and just lately died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great historians of the </v>

75
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Bolshevik revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't ever see someone like that </v>

76
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:31.501
<v Speaker 1>replaced with somebody like him that'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>always be replaced by somebody working </v>

77
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>on gender history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>native American history that,</v>

78
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.170
<v Speaker 1>that process whereby there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement of conservative historians,</v>

79
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.440
<v Speaker 1>was a more or less annual events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got accustomed to being in a real </v>

80
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>minority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minority of conservative historians.</v>

81
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I got accustomed to losing pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>every vote.</v>

82
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Being in the minority on every </v>
<v Speaker 1>committee.</v>

83
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.960
<v Speaker 1>It became a kind of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to climatize to it.</v>

84
00:05:00.961 --> 00:05:05.961
<v Speaker 1>And then one day suddenly hit you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were practically the last one left.</v>

85
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

86
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>when I moved to Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revelation was quite startling.</v>

87
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I was invited to come to the hoover </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution,</v>

88
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>many hoover fellows who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>associations,</v>

89
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>a joint appointments with Stanford </v>
<v Speaker 1>departments.</v>

90
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I had been pretty successful as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher at Harvard.</v>

91
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>My classes had been very large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

92
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>the students gave me very powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluations.</v>

93
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of assumed that I would come to </v>

94
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Stanford and have some relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history department.</v>

95
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>And then I was told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

96
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:36.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

97
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>none at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even a courtesy appointment.</v>

98
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
<v Speaker 1>And it was clear at that moment that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had become in the eyes of the Stanford </v>

99
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>History Department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a pariah,</v>

100
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.310
<v Speaker 1>somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who simply couldn't be allowed in the </v>

101
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>building because of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my conservative leanings.</v>

102
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Can you explain little bit more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the universities work like that,</v>

103
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could even happen?</v>

104
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>They're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to bring you in,</v>

105
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fellow there,</v>

106
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:09.581
<v Speaker 1>and that you're just going to be ignored</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the department that you're an expert </v>

107
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:09.581
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

108
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>It's quite insulting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as you mentioned,</v>

109
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've published,</v>

110
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:19.031
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of Buddhists rather more </v>

111
00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:21.641
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than most of the department put </v>

112
00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

113
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a department with falling enrollments </v>

114
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:32.861
<v Speaker 1>might have been expected to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to want to have a me playing apart.</v>

115
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.650
<v Speaker 1>But what happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's happened in most departments </v>

116
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.011
<v Speaker 1>and most universities inexorably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left to Kovar and an implicit rule,</v>

117
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>tacit rule was imposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one does not hire,</v>

118
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leaning a historians know does one </v>

119
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're graduate students.</v>

120
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.230
<v Speaker 1>So the two people who have been my </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate students have found it </v>

121
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 1>to get hired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's essentially a straightforward,</v>

123
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>a process whereby the institution has </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken over one committee at a time and </v>

124
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 1>the left has been good at that for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>better part of a century.</v>

125
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 1>They've always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you think they saw that?</v>

126
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>How did they have the foresight to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

127
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 1>we've got to take over the university's </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

128
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.210
<v Speaker 1>the previous generation of historians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was also true of philosophers </v>

130
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>and people working in other fields did </v>
<v Speaker 1>not fight very hard,</v>

131
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or effectively to promote their </v>

132
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.170
<v Speaker 1>successes in academic life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to be mindful of the </v>

133
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.401
<v Speaker 1>succession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The left was better at ensuring that </v>

134
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.590
<v Speaker 1>it's proteges got the appointments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately academia is a committee's </v>

135
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:55.661
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about getting to be the chair </v>

136
00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 1>of the department to be in charge of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>committees.</v>

137
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>If you control the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you control the selection,</v>

138
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you control the recruitment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose I'm,</v>

139
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a naive person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of in my youth,</v>

140
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>assumed we were in abroadly meritocratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>world in which if you were smart and </v>

141
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 1>hardworking working then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then good things would happen.</v>

142
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 1>And it took me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was completely naive.</v>

143
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:22.490
<v Speaker 1>It took me a while to cottoned onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that in,</v>

144
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 1>in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in academic life,</v>

145
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.940
<v Speaker 1>as other walks of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patronage is everything and you can be </v>

146
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.340
<v Speaker 1>as talented as you like if you're not in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right patronage network,</v>

147
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.850
<v Speaker 1>then you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose it's been thinking about </v>

148
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.121
<v Speaker 1>these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do networks capture institutions </v>

149
00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:46.830
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that led me to write the most recent </v>

150
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:46.830
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the square and the tower,</v>

151
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.931
<v Speaker 1>which is actually book number 15 to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about how networks operate.</v>

152
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to talk casually about networks,</v>

153
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 1>but I came to realize that in academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>life as another areas,</v>

154
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you need to understand quite exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite precisely how networks operate.</v>

155
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:08.210
<v Speaker 1>To see how power is truly wielded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can all see the hierarchical </v>

156
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>institutions that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where power is located.</v>

157
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even universities are not as powerful </v>

158
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.000
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as governments,</v>

159
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.240
<v Speaker 1>but the critical point is to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the disease often networks that capture </v>

160
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.410
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the capture the hierarchies.</v>

161
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened in academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

162
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.950
<v Speaker 1>And now I think pretty soon there just </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't be conservatives in university </v>

163
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 1>departments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More importantly than that,</v>

164
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>nobody will be teaching subjects like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of the Soviet Union,</v>

165
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:40.130
<v Speaker 1>so no students will be taught about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crimes of Lenin and Stalin and students </v>

166
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:47.390
<v Speaker 1>like the students I taught yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 1>will not hear from inability that the </v>

167
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 1>was a religious motivation to the nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 attacks.</v>

168
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I had a class at Stanford just the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>was allowed to sit in and teach somebody</v>

169
00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:02.361
<v Speaker 1>else's class as a guest professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it happened to be a discussion about</v>

170
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

171
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.120
<v Speaker 1>and it became clear to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>students had never considered the </v>

172
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>possibility that there was a religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>

173
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the nine slash 11 attacks and more or</v>

174
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:23.661
<v Speaker 1>less accepted the idea that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>retaliation for the misdeeds of US </v>

175
00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are called the Howard Zinn theory.</v>

176
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.390
<v Speaker 1>And since Howard Zinn's books are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>widely read in the United States than </v>

177
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.171
<v Speaker 1>anybody else's history books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we therefore arrive at a situation in </v>

178
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 1>which there will be nobody in any major </v>
<v Speaker 1>university saying,</v>

179
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Howard Zinn is completely wrong.</v>

180
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 1>And this is not what nine slash 11 was </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

181
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I find depressing when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that the culture was kind of over in</v>

182
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 1>the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what I mean.</v>

183
00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's circle back because it does </v>

184
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.760
<v Speaker 2>bring us to your 15th book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stand corrected.</v>

185
00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

186
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 2>this idea of networks because we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking right before we started that </v>

187
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 2>there's something happening here with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this loose association of people that </v>

188
00:11:08.531 --> 00:11:11.290
<v Speaker 2>has been coined the intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark web.</v>

189
00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:13.810
<v Speaker 2>And I said to you when you walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you part of the intellectual,</v>

190
00:11:13.811 --> 00:11:17.440
<v Speaker 2>dark web as if you were going to give me</v>
<v Speaker 2>a secret handshake or a special card?</v>

191
00:11:17.441 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Or when I was asked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

192
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:23.751
<v Speaker 2>I denied all knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The assumption that it was secret and </v>

193
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:24.730
<v Speaker 2>then it turned out to be all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York Times.</v>

194
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you weren't,</v>

195
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.660
<v Speaker 2>you weren't photographed in the bushes </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the rest of us,</v>

196
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:31.940
<v Speaker 2>but I suspect that you secretly are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual,</v>

197
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:32.890
<v Speaker 2>a dark web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

198
00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't possibly reveal that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's secret.</v>

199
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.550
<v Speaker 2>But you said something interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of your level of academic,</v>

200
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.430
<v Speaker 2>sort of academic credit that you thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps that took you out of it,</v>

201
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:47.860
<v Speaker 2>but then Christina Hoff summers said </v>
<v Speaker 2>something interesting.</v>

202
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.430
<v Speaker 2>You go from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

203
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emailed me and my wife Ayaan Hirsi Ali,</v>

204
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:57.010
<v Speaker 1>who's been on your show is much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting than me,</v>

205
00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 1>is the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we.</v>

206
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:03.390
<v Speaker 1>She must be tough for you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people love your work and </v>

207
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.920
<v Speaker 1>everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like ion is like transcendence.</v>

208
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.490
<v Speaker 1>She's one of the most enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful blessing in my life to be </v>

209
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.600
<v Speaker 1>married to somebody who's just way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting than me that's not looking </v>

210
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 1>to so that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were both asked my Barry Weiss,</v>

211
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.300
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual dark web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd said,</v>

212
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:27.301
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I really claim to be part of </v>

213
00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:27.301
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I taught for 12 years at Harvard,</v>

214
00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 1>left of my own volition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here at Stanford,</v>

215
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.210
<v Speaker 1>can write newspaper columns and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>them published more or less where I want</v>

216
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:39.650
<v Speaker 1>it would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be a little disingenuous to to </v>

217
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.570
<v Speaker 1>claim kinship with people like Bret </v>
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein who've been persecuted by the </v>

218
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:43.960
<v Speaker 1>academic left.</v>

219
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Now I've been attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been criticized,</v>

220
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:48.280
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't really been driven </v>
<v Speaker 1>underground,</v>

221
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:53.281
<v Speaker 1>at least not at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Christina Summers said to me just </v>

222
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:54.630
<v Speaker 1>the other night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

223
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not about whether you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>denied a platform or not.</v>

224
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all the people in the article </v>

225
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.151
<v Speaker 1>that Barry wrote of have plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to make their views known.</v>

226
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.550
<v Speaker 1>It's about whether you are seen to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people who feel that they have been </v>

227
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:17.461
<v Speaker 1>silenced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who feel that their voices aren't heard </v>

228
00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:20.010
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's quite a good definition of what </v>

229
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:20.010
<v Speaker 1>this is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also right to,</v>

230
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see that it's a network.</v>

231
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:26.340
<v Speaker 1>As I was reading the article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking how funny I know all </v>

232
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.461
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the sole exception of Jordan </v>

233
00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:29.461
<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I've never.</v>

234
00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:29.480
<v Speaker 1>That um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

235
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I sent that's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

236
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look forward to it.</v>

237
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

238
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a network of the most,</v>

239
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal sought.</v>

240
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:44.310
<v Speaker 1>It is a truly informal network of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>from right across the political spectrum</v>

241
00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:50.371
<v Speaker 1>because nobody could call Bret Weinstein</v>
<v Speaker 1>of conservatives who have come together </v>

242
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.080
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>informally.</v>

243
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Nobody called it into being and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm forming the intellectual dark web.</v>

244
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Turn up on Monday at 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM.</v>

245
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Change as it change the second it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

246
00:14:03.071 --> 00:14:05.770
<v Speaker 1>generally a network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if this is the right type of network,</v>

247
00:14:05.771 --> 00:14:06.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>

248
00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:11.521
<v Speaker 1>Kind of diverse group of people who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different motivations and </v>

249
00:14:11.521 --> 00:14:12.940
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once it's sort of named,</v>

250
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 1>does that change the way a network has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to operate?</v>

251
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:20.971
<v Speaker 1>Because I sent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the discussion is about </v>

252
00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:20.971
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm not not.</v>

253
00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:24.631
<v Speaker 1>I think fundamentally that the critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is when something ceases to be </v>

254
00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:26.620
<v Speaker 1>secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell the story of the Illuminati,</v>

255
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.760
<v Speaker 1>a network in the late 18th century in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany that sought to advance a radical</v>

256
00:14:32.891 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 1>version of the enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but covertly as a secret organization.</v>

257
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.720
<v Speaker 1>The intellectual dark web I sent me </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously said was secrets until Barry </v>

258
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:48.070
<v Speaker 1>wrote that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now that it's out in the open,</v>

259
00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 1>what will happen is that it will grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people are Andrew Sullivan.</v>

260
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I was discussing with him to said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

261
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 1>why am tiredness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the answer is,</v>

262
00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 1>but you should be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean anybody who,</v>

263
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.540
<v Speaker 1>who is engaged in critical thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the whole range of ideas in our </v>

264
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ranging from the political to the social</v>

265
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:14.621
<v Speaker 1>and cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who is in the debate and is </v>

266
00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:18.191
<v Speaker 1>antagonistic to the dogmas of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

267
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 1>the political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the identity politics,</v>

268
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Speaker 1>the spurious pursuit of so called social</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice.</v>

269
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.370
<v Speaker 1>If you are skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are thinking critically about the</v>

270
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:31.840
<v Speaker 1>dogmas of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you belong in the intellectual dark</v>

271
00:15:31.841 --> 00:15:36.841
<v Speaker 1>web because you're the kind of person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who will at some point will be no </v>

272
00:15:36.841 --> 00:15:39.740
<v Speaker 1>platformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who at some point will be taken down who</v>

273
00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:42.800
<v Speaker 1>at some point will be the target of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit piece in the New York Times.</v>

274
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.460
<v Speaker 1>One of the characteristic features of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual dark whereby think is </v>

275
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.911
<v Speaker 1>that most members at one time or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>have fallen foul of the leftist thought </v>

276
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 1>police and as soon as you've had that </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

277
00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>it's happened to me a number of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is quite transformative.</v>

278
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

279
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:03.470
<v Speaker 1>it literally changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only reason you're sitting here</v>

280
00:16:03.471 --> 00:16:06.680
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was once one of them and and I suspect</v>

281
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:11.681
<v Speaker 1>that your experience was like mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of taken aback to be on the </v>

282
00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:17.831
<v Speaker 1>receiving end of a social media mob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of taken aback to be </v>

283
00:16:18.351 --> 00:16:23.351
<v Speaker 1>attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for the substance of anything that </v>

284
00:16:23.351 --> 00:16:27.101
<v Speaker 1>you've argued or written or said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're attacked for your reputation,</v>

285
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 1>you're attacked for your alleged bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>

286
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.300
<v Speaker 1>and each time this has happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've.</v>

287
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I've been a little stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was naive.</v>

288
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Not only was I a believer in </v>
<v Speaker 1>meritocracy,</v>

289
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I was also a believer that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in a rational debate about the </v>

290
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:47.390
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

291
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:52.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what historians do a and that one</v>
<v Speaker 1>made ones case presented the evidence </v>

292
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 1>and then the other side did the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wrote a book,</v>

293
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.110
<v Speaker 1>a book about the British Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what,</v>

294
00:17:00.111 --> 00:17:03.230
<v Speaker 1>15 or so years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an argument.</v>

295
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:08.231
<v Speaker 1>That argument of that book was that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything about the British empire was </v>

296
00:17:08.231 --> 00:17:09.140
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there are benefits as well as costs</v>

297
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.440
<v Speaker 1>to imperialism and I never had a debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that argument.</v>

298
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I only ever was attacked by the left for</v>
<v Speaker 1>being an apologist of empire and </v>

299
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 1>neocolonialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

300
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so in that curious debate that,</v>

301
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.920
<v Speaker 1>that is central to the culture war you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never really are engaged with on the </v>

302
00:17:33.231 --> 00:17:38.231
<v Speaker 1>ideas or the evidence it is always about</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you have bad faith or not,</v>

303
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.720
<v Speaker 1>whether you are covertly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

304
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.330
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

305
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:48.340
<v Speaker 1>an Islamaphobe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a homophobe that there's a long list of </v>

306
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 1>things that you can be accused of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are the most popular ones.</v>

307
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Ones never really discussing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments of the books.</v>

308
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.990
<v Speaker 1>One's always discussing the personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the author.</v>

309
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is just sort of simply put the </v>

310
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 1>ideas verse people conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

311
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:08.151
<v Speaker 1>So in a case of a van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to live through the things that </v>

312
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:13.161
<v Speaker 1>she has lived through between fgm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>her and her and her friend being </v>

313
00:18:13.161 --> 00:18:16.500
<v Speaker 1>murdered and the whole thing to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the things that she's called.</v>

314
00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it flips,</v>

315
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.300
<v Speaker 1>you're very personhood on its head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>

316
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so deeply twisted.</v>

317
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.200
<v Speaker 1>The episode that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me brought it into bold relief was </v>

318
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.740
<v Speaker 1>the brandeis a honorary degree fiasco </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was invited by the president of </v>

319
00:18:35.161 --> 00:18:40.161
<v Speaker 1>Brandeis and this was in 2017 to accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>an honorary degree and speak at </v>

320
00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:40.590
<v Speaker 1>commencement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

321
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:46.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very publicly and humiliatingly </v>

322
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.160
<v Speaker 1>disinvited under pressure from an unholy</v>
<v Speaker 1>alliance as far as I could see of </v>

323
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.600
<v Speaker 1>leftists and Islamicists who sets out </v>
<v Speaker 1>online to smear her reputation with the </v>

324
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:58.500
<v Speaker 1>usual confection of selective quotation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

325
00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.030
<v Speaker 1>and misrepresentation.</v>

326
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 1>And as often happens in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

327
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:06.150
<v Speaker 1>the university authorities capitulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>without a fight,</v>

328
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the left and,</v>

329
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.910
<v Speaker 1>and they do it publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

330
00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:15.911
<v Speaker 1>that for me was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a moment when I learned a lot </v>

331
00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:19.251
<v Speaker 1>about what was going wrong in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic life and realize that it's the </v>

332
00:19:19.251 --> 00:19:23.100
<v Speaker 1>combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of aggressive activists on the left,</v>

333
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and useful idiots in a university.</v>

334
00:19:26.761 --> 00:19:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Bureaucracies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fold it.</v>

335
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Is it that they're useful idiots or is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

336
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:36.291
<v Speaker 1>is it just sort of blanket cowardice by </v>
<v Speaker 1>on part of some of the academics,</v>

337
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:42.050
<v Speaker 1>but really the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the administrators and the upper brass </v>

338
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.590
<v Speaker 1>at all the schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that the donors,</v>

339
00:19:43.591 --> 00:19:46.860
<v Speaker 1>although this is changing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as we're taping this today,</v>

340
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I know it's going to be out in a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of days,</v>

341
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evergreen is now firing a whole bunch of</v>

342
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:53.190
<v Speaker 1>professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly whatever what all of us</v>

343
00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:58.191
<v Speaker 1>predicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically because the donors have just </v>

344
00:19:58.191 --> 00:19:58.191
<v Speaker 1>had enough.</v>

345
00:19:58.191 --> 00:19:59.790
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to figure out where does it</v>

346
00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just coders.</v>

347
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Coders is the most powerful force in </v>
<v Speaker 1>human history,</v>

348
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:08.060
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm constantly amazed at just how </v>

349
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.940
<v Speaker 1>much cowardice is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

350
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.620
<v Speaker 1>my wife's experience has shown me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

351
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.960
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difficulty of getting people </v>

352
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.331
<v Speaker 1>publicly to support her work against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic extremism is all about </v>

353
00:20:20.331 --> 00:20:23.610
<v Speaker 1>cowardice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of being in any way drawn into,</v>

354
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real war,</v>

355
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.800
<v Speaker 1>the jihad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing the death threats that she has </v>

356
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.070
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly had to face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not just cowardice.</v>

357
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:37.450
<v Speaker 1>And there's a good deal of complicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many university administrators are </v>

358
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:41.310
<v Speaker 1>themselves ideologically on the left and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that they have a mission to empower</v>

359
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.550
<v Speaker 1>the leftists in the student body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

360
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.590
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

361
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.890
<v Speaker 1>a different thing from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from covered this.</v>

362
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:52.500
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

363
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a fascinating moment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time because donors,</v>

364
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.890
<v Speaker 1>alumni look at what is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

365
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 1>on university campuses as do people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have not had the privilege of university</v>

366
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:11.380
<v Speaker 1>education who see it almost complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>madness and ask the question,</v>

367
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:12.730
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is going on here?</v>

368
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And I think the more that question gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked,</v>

369
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.400
<v Speaker 1>the better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we should not underestimate the </v>

370
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.670
<v Speaker 1>massive inertia in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is extremely hard.</v>

371
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're a university president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

372
00:21:23.471 --> 00:21:24.640
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to clean house.</v>

373
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.550
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to do because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all tenured.</v>

374
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:32.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean the faculty is tenured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get what happened </v>

375
00:21:32.551 --> 00:21:32.551
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

376
00:21:32.551 --> 00:21:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

377
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.040
<v Speaker 1>in the northeast it's a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than,</v>

378
00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:36.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just even geographically,</v>

379
00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:37.660
<v Speaker 1>we just don't even see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

380
00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:42.661
<v Speaker 1>there are bastions of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard University of Chicago or a </v>

381
00:21:42.661 --> 00:21:43.270
<v Speaker 1>couple of places are a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

382
00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:45.580
<v Speaker 1>but how do you think it actually spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way?</v>

383
00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 1>That it wasn't just here and there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll this theory that universities are </v>

384
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.170
<v Speaker 1>always left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not true of,</v>

385
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.240
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had been in Germany in the 19 </v>

386
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:57.240
<v Speaker 1>twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

387
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.380
<v Speaker 1>the universities were bastions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism,</v>

388
00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.350
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an extreme and indeed extreme right wing</v>

389
00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:07.351
<v Speaker 1>nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one reason that universities </v>

390
00:22:07.351 --> 00:22:08.410
<v Speaker 1>very quickly went over to the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>regime when Hitler came to power.</v>

391
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no golden rule that says </v>

392
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.211
<v Speaker 1>universities have to be left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxford and Cambridge in 18th century </v>

393
00:22:15.211 --> 00:22:19.981
<v Speaker 1>were extraordinary reactionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fundamentally religious institutions </v>

394
00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:22.220
<v Speaker 1>and deeply Tori with a few exceptions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

395
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.810
<v Speaker 1>in the politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no rule rule here.</v>

396
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best explanation I can offer</v>

397
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:34.411
<v Speaker 1>you is a process of generational capture</v>
<v Speaker 1>of education institutions dating from </v>

398
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties universities in let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the elite universities,</v>

399
00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:43.210
<v Speaker 1>the Ivy League universities in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties.</v>

400
00:22:43.211 --> 00:22:47.160
<v Speaker 1>We're already seen as being liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

401
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:52.350
<v Speaker 1>and if you were a kind of mccarthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaning Republican,</v>

402
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you already knew that Harvard was likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of fellow travelers and a covert </v>

403
00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:02.710
<v Speaker 1>commies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the real shift I think came later.</v>

404
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it came with the antiwar </v>
<v Speaker 1>protests of the late sixties and early </v>

405
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.341
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more radical baby boomers who were </v>

406
00:23:11.341 --> 00:23:13.390
<v Speaker 1>protesting in the campuses and 68 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the early seventies.</v>

407
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:18.280
<v Speaker 1>It grew up to become professors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still around.</v>

408
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that generation which was </v>

409
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.120
<v Speaker 1>essentially formed at the time of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>antiwar protests,</v>

410
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 1>successfully replicated itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were very,</v>

411
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:34.141
<v Speaker 1>very good at replicating themselves by </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating graduate students in their own </v>

412
00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 1>image and then making sure that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduates,</v>

413
00:23:36.701 --> 00:23:40.240
<v Speaker 1>students got jobs and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the right was nowhere.</v>

414
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.250
<v Speaker 1>So you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were out there writing books,</v>

415
00:23:42.251 --> 00:23:46.120
<v Speaker 1>doing research and figuring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

416
00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.420
<v Speaker 1>they're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe in the long run on my heroes </v>

417
00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.210
<v Speaker 1>at Oxford and Cambridge who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wrote great books and we're also </v>

418
00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:59.080
<v Speaker 1>politically active people like norman </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone or Roger Scruton who did much of </v>

419
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 1>the thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

420
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.940
<v Speaker 1>that accompanied that tourism in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>

421
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.970
<v Speaker 1>What they did not do well was academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

422
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 1>They were poor it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

423
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.400
<v Speaker 1>they were poor at succession planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

424
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best explanation I can offer for the</v>

425
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:18.920
<v Speaker 1>fact that in nearly all universities in </v>
<v Speaker 1>North America and in Europe,</v>

426
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:24.190
<v Speaker 1>90 percent plus of faculty members are </v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberals or progressives,</v>

427
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:26.000
<v Speaker 1>if not outright Marxists.</v>

428
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with some of the historical context </v>

429
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.461
<v Speaker 1>of how this all happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you are enthused about this new </v>

430
00:24:33.461 --> 00:24:34.970
<v Speaker 1>network idea and because it's come </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the right way,</v>

431
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:40.210
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's a gatekeeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for whoever is involved </v>

432
00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:44.471
<v Speaker 1>in this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This seems to be one of the hot button </v>

433
00:24:44.471 --> 00:24:45.710
<v Speaker 1>issues with this thing are who can be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

434
00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:50.711
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the ideas that can not be on </v>

435
00:24:50.711 --> 00:24:50.711
<v Speaker 1>the inside?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

436
00:24:50.711 --> 00:24:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I see it coming much more that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to watch out for ideas on the right than</v>

437
00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:59.681
<v Speaker 1>on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be the way it's being </v>

438
00:24:59.681 --> 00:24:59.681
<v Speaker 1>framed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least from where I sit.</v>

439
00:24:59.681 --> 00:25:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you do that in a,</v>

440
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.780
<v Speaker 1>in a proper network monitoring?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two kinds of,</v>

441
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.200
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of net was open access networks.</v>

442
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's take the example of facebook where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just join up an open a facebook </v>

443
00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:12.380
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>

444
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.110
<v Speaker 1>You can even do it as a fake human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

445
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.770
<v Speaker 1>and then there are the restricted access</v>
<v Speaker 1>networks,</v>

446
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme cases,</v>

447
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:26.530
<v Speaker 1>the secret societies of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 18th and 19th century don't </v>

448
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:30.641
<v Speaker 1>really have many analogs today because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to do anything secret in </v>

449
00:25:30.641 --> 00:25:33.800
<v Speaker 1>barely exists any anymore in the age of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Wiki leaks.</v>

450
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:39.040
<v Speaker 1>So you have to decide whether to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>open or closed or restricted access </v>

451
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.960
<v Speaker 1>network and the minute you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted access network,</v>

452
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.420
<v Speaker 1>somebody is making the decisions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>who joins that then ends up being the,</v>

453
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:51.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the membership committee and then you </v>

454
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.470
<v Speaker 1>were just a club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

455
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's an option in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

456
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I think an open access networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only real way to go,</v>

457
00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you must accept that if the,</v>

458
00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:02.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the intellectual dot webb is real,</v>

459
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:08.260
<v Speaker 1>that it's an open access network that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that won't necessarily connect you to </v>

460
00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:13.781
<v Speaker 1>ever really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want to be connected to a may </v>

461
00:26:13.781 --> 00:26:16.241
<v Speaker 1>connect you to people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>positively don't want to be connected </v>

462
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:16.241
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

463
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.110
<v Speaker 1>This has been a central problem I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

464
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.980
<v Speaker 1>being on the political right for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

465
00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I can remember in the 19 eighties when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people said to me,</v>

466
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil,</v>

467
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:29.540
<v Speaker 1>you're a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say,</v>

468
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:34.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually not a member of the </v>

469
00:26:34.541 --> 00:26:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Conservative Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of myself as a classical </v>

470
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:37.120
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would say,</v>

471
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:37.120
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nevertheless,</v>

472
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.630
<v Speaker 1>when I look at all the things you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a conservative,</v>

473
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 1>and then I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

474
00:26:40.221 --> 00:26:43.130
<v Speaker 1>That I have to have dinner with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>likes of,</v>

475
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I would think of various egregious </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative members of parliament.</v>

476
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.670
<v Speaker 1>And it was as if you would be associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with those people even if you never had </v>

477
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:57.230
<v Speaker 1>dinner with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same problem now except </v>

478
00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.051
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worse now because the way in which </v>

479
00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.710
<v Speaker 1>the left seeks to discredit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

480
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:05.370
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson and probably me as well.</v>

481
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Now that I'm on your show man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean 15.</v>

482
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Look at the people who are connected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who quote these people or </v>

483
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 1>who read the books that there they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there,</v>

484
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.400
<v Speaker 1>but terrible alt right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

485
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:25.860
<v Speaker 1>when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

486
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 1>the audience is supposed to start booing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hissing and you know,</v>

487
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bannon is supposed to appear in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>black robe with a sife.</v>

488
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am deaf.</v>

489
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.970
<v Speaker 1>So I think that the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in escapable there will be a </v>

490
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.830
<v Speaker 1>constant effort on the left to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

491
00:27:43.831 --> 00:27:48.831
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual dark web is just some </v>

492
00:27:48.831 --> 00:27:50.520
<v Speaker 1>kind of a facade in front of a hideous </v>
<v Speaker 1>outright,</v>

493
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.660
<v Speaker 1>which is composed of remember racists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobes,</v>

494
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.110
<v Speaker 1>homophobes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that will be the culture was next,</v>

495
00:27:58.111 --> 00:27:59.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is how it works.</v>

496
00:27:59.491 --> 00:28:03.810
<v Speaker 1>We have a strange amount of gay people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Muslim people and absolutely.</v>

497
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:09.290
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise Brown people and every other </v>

498
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:09.290
<v Speaker 1>type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the self,</v>

499
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:13.490
<v Speaker 1>the self hating phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left has long known how to say that </v>

500
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.560
<v Speaker 1>it is absolutely typical of the wicked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

501
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.490
<v Speaker 1>That they should have lured into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the side,</v>

502
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 1>a self hating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you just fill in the blank.</v>

503
00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Self hating Muslims self hating gays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how this works.</v>

504
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Remember they lost all the arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they've got left is reputational </v>

505
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.760
<v Speaker 1>smearing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to fight in front of us.</v>

506
00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

507
00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have lost sleep about this.</v>

508
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Not only because people threatened my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife's life.</v>

509
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:49.221
<v Speaker 1>That's the real war that the war against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Islamic extremists is.</v>

510
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:53.100
<v Speaker 1>No is no mere culture wards and actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

511
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I've also lost sleep about the media </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture war at the prospect of,</v>

512
00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.770
<v Speaker 1>of the reputational attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

513
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.280
<v Speaker 1>it's never pleasant to be attacked as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was recently in effect for being a,</v>

514
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I guess a sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist or a racist sexist because I'd </v>

515
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:16.380
<v Speaker 1>organized a conference at which all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>

516
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were white men because the women are </v>

517
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.700
<v Speaker 1>invited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't come back.</v>

518
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.400
<v Speaker 1>It was a private conference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't supposed to,</v>

519
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.900
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of informal discussion about</v>

520
00:29:30.901 --> 00:29:35.901
<v Speaker 1>how we could take the idea of applied </v>
<v Speaker 1>history and make history more relevant </v>

521
00:29:37.441 --> 00:29:42.441
<v Speaker 1>to some of the debates that go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of what has done in </v>

522
00:29:42.441 --> 00:29:45.840
<v Speaker 1>academic history these days is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really relevant to anything terribly </v>

523
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.811
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this event was a rather crudely </v>

524
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:51.760
<v Speaker 1>exposed in the New York Times and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post,</v>

525
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pictures of the speakers were </v>

526
00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.730
<v Speaker 1>published as if the mugshots as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>appeared in the New York Times.</v>

527
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.270
<v Speaker 1>And the implication was that I must be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible racist,</v>

528
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:09.271
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sexist racist for having organized </v>

529
00:30:09.271 --> 00:30:11.461
<v Speaker 1>such a conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did lose sleep about that.</v>

530
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

531
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I think that part of the culture war is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really is really odious because it is,</v>

532
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:24.760
<v Speaker 1>it is calculated to discredit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

533
00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.570
<v Speaker 1>the targeted individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is,</v>

534
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:33.760
<v Speaker 1>it's bad faith on the part of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who launched those attacks.</v>

535
00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:38.850
<v Speaker 2>So in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening with some of those </v>

536
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.840
<v Speaker 2>gated institutions when the newspapers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that used to be objective,</v>

537
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:46.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barry wrote this piece in the New York </v>

538
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Times that I think was a pretty fair </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece.</v>

539
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.190
<v Speaker 2>It was even somewhat critical of me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not above criticism,</v>

540
00:30:48.191 --> 00:30:51.010
<v Speaker 2>so I'm certainly okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then just a week later,</v>

541
00:30:51.011 --> 00:30:56.011
<v Speaker 2>we see this awful piece about Jordan and</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforced monogamy and it's just </v>

542
00:30:56.011 --> 00:30:57.700
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just nonsense.</v>

543
00:30:57.701 --> 00:31:02.701
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on tour with him right now and he </v>

544
00:31:02.701 --> 00:31:04.201
<v Speaker 2>keeps explaining why that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course he doesn't want anyone to be </v>

545
00:31:04.201 --> 00:31:05.800
<v Speaker 2>forced to do anything and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about marriage in effect.</v>

546
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

547
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:10.300
<v Speaker 2>and Eric Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our friend found two other references in</v>

548
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:15.301
<v Speaker 2>the history of the New York Times where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they talked about enforcement I'll give </v>

549
00:31:15.301 --> 00:31:16.030
<v Speaker 2>me and they were both positive relative </v>
<v Speaker 2>to progressive ideals.</v>

550
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's like they flip everything on its</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

551
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:18.910
<v Speaker 2>But what do you think happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

552
00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:22.480
<v Speaker 2>you're giving me a pretty good layout of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happened at the academic side,</v>

553
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 2>but on the media side and those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those gates,</v>

554
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:30.750
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of my life doing </v>

555
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:33.380
<v Speaker 1>journalism because I didn't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

556
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.520
<v Speaker 1>inherited money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And being an academic in Britain in the </v>

557
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.520
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties and nineties wasn't terribly</v>
<v Speaker 1>lucrative.</v>

558
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:44.521
<v Speaker 1>So I kept body and soul together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even from my graduate years writing for </v>

559
00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:46.630
<v Speaker 1>newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

560
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers have had their own </v>

561
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.010
<v Speaker 1>transformation in the course of my adult</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

562
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.760
<v Speaker 1>A part of that sister economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we all know,</v>

563
00:31:57.761 --> 00:32:02.761
<v Speaker 1>the business model which essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolved around advertising has been </v>

564
00:32:02.761 --> 00:32:05.941
<v Speaker 1>annihilated by the combination of Google</v>
<v Speaker 1>and facebook and these institutions are </v>

565
00:32:05.941 --> 00:32:10.501
<v Speaker 1>in some measure in desperation trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinvent themselves for the Internet age</v>

566
00:32:10.541 --> 00:32:15.541
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's in pursuit of clickbait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the gray lady,</v>

567
00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:18.970
<v Speaker 1>even the most illustrious of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of newspapers.</v>

568
00:32:18.971 --> 00:32:23.971
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other explanation is that an </v>

569
00:32:23.971 --> 00:32:27.250
<v Speaker 1>institution like the New York Times has </v>
<v Speaker 1>its own university,</v>

570
00:32:27.251 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 1>like character behaves a little bit like</v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

571
00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.530
<v Speaker 1>The most self important newspapers if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to them are rather like colleges.</v>

572
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's also true of the Financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>Times,</v>

573
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.560
<v Speaker 1>which is that like a kind of Cambridge </v>
<v Speaker 1>college that sort of ended up by mistake</v>

574
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:47.561
<v Speaker 1>in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they have some of the same </v>

575
00:32:47.561 --> 00:32:47.561
<v Speaker 1>dynamics as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as universities.</v>

576
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's especially true of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times.</v>

577
00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Also true of the BBC incidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So institutions like the times and the </v>

578
00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.141
<v Speaker 1>BBC are think of themselves as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal bastions,</v>

579
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:04.730
<v Speaker 1>but for them liberalism is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same problem at Harvard has,</v>

580
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your motto is Veritas,</v>

581
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:12.130
<v Speaker 1>but you translate that into liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then by definition conservatives and </v>

582
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:16.561
<v Speaker 1>must be untruth and so I think there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency and it's there and in the New </v>

583
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:21.820
<v Speaker 1>York Times periodically to lash out </v>
<v Speaker 1>against anyone like Jordan Peterson who </v>

584
00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.050
<v Speaker 1>dissents from liberal orthodoxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

585
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.150
<v Speaker 1>part of what we're dealing here with is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of quiz I religious phenomenon.</v>

586
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:34.690
<v Speaker 1>The dogmas of the left have become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more religious in their quality as </v>

587
00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:41.411
<v Speaker 1>they have been unmerge from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental economic rationality which </v>

588
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:46.460
<v Speaker 1>was at the heart of Marxism when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all went down in flames in 1989,</v>

589
00:33:46.461 --> 00:33:51.461
<v Speaker 1>the left decamped to the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and as it did that it </v>

590
00:33:51.461 --> 00:33:54.000
<v Speaker 1>increasingly to on the form of a cult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good.</v>

591
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Let me illustrate what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colts defined themselves partly by a </v>

592
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.670
<v Speaker 1>belief in a lot of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly weird.</v>

593
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:07.120
<v Speaker 1>In order to be an account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have some weird beliefs and </v>

594
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.001
<v Speaker 1>one good example of a weird belief is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sexuality is entirely constructed </v>

595
00:34:10.001 --> 00:34:13.790
<v Speaker 1>socially and is not biologically rooted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can actually have any gender you</v>

596
00:34:13.791 --> 00:34:17.600
<v Speaker 1>like and there are actually multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>genders now that's absurd,</v>

597
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:23.260
<v Speaker 1>but to believe it has become a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>test of your orthodoxy.</v>

598
00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

599
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:31.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one sees this at meetings are in </v>

600
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.451
<v Speaker 1>academia in which people introduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves by name and by their </v>

601
00:34:34.451 --> 00:34:35.570
<v Speaker 1>preferred pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

602
00:34:35.571 --> 00:34:40.571
<v Speaker 1>when this first happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my immediate reaction was introduced </v>

603
00:34:40.571 --> 00:34:41.090
<v Speaker 1>myself and say that my preferred </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns were,</v>

604
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:46.180
<v Speaker 1>it restrain myself because I realized </v>
<v Speaker 1>that my sense of humor forged as it was </v>

605
00:34:47.391 --> 00:34:51.380
<v Speaker 1>in Scotland in the 19 seventies is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost entirely politically incorrect.</v>

606
00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:54.830
<v Speaker 1>And anything that I consider funny will </v>
<v Speaker 1>get me into trouble.</v>

607
00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.280
<v Speaker 1>But that has gone on in the media too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that's happened is </v>

608
00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.481
<v Speaker 1>that the polarization which </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes a network society is now </v>

609
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:10.360
<v Speaker 1>very visibly there in the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers and cable television.</v>

610
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.700
<v Speaker 1>One thing that we all got wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet,</v>

611
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 1>because we hadn't really thought much </v>
<v Speaker 1>about network science,</v>

612
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.460
<v Speaker 1>was that we just assumed that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was connected,</v>

613
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.790
<v Speaker 1>everything would be awesome and that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of mantra of Silicon Valley for</v>

614
00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:26.840
<v Speaker 1>about 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no network science tells you that if</v>

615
00:35:26.841 --> 00:35:29.420
<v Speaker 1>you build a social network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even quite a small one,</v>

616
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.900
<v Speaker 1>there will be something called homophily</v>
<v Speaker 1>because birds of a feather flock </v>

617
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.140
<v Speaker 1>together on bet you already.</v>

618
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.950
<v Speaker 1>That the intellectual dark web has two </v>
<v Speaker 1>clusters that are somewhat separate from</v>

619
00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:45.951
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sense it happening right now </v>

620
00:35:45.951 --> 00:35:45.951
<v Speaker 1>immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happened in the media.</v>

621
00:35:45.951 --> 00:35:49.740
<v Speaker 1>So as society became more polarized </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>

622
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:54.741
<v Speaker 1>so to to the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an issue that is one of </v>

623
00:35:54.741 --> 00:35:58.071
<v Speaker 1>the defining characteristics of our age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The polarization or if you like self </v>

624
00:35:58.231 --> 00:36:03.231
<v Speaker 1>segregation that we see online is </v>
<v Speaker 1>translated into almost every realm of </v>

625
00:36:03.231 --> 00:36:04.980
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can there be any positives out of that,</v>

626
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:10.580
<v Speaker 1>out of that self selection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into finding groups that you're more in </v>

627
00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:10.580
<v Speaker 1>common with</v>

628
00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.260
<v Speaker 2>that for at least for a certain period </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>

629
00:36:12.261 --> 00:36:17.261
<v Speaker 2>There's some goodness there because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can really sort of get into your ideas </v>

630
00:36:17.261 --> 00:36:19.790
<v Speaker 2>enough to maybe leave the group then and</v>
<v Speaker 2>take those ideas out.</v>

631
00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.930
<v Speaker 1>I think if you are in what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>call it,</v>

632
00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:28.931
<v Speaker 1>the echo chamber or the filter bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are in a cluster that cuts you </v>

633
00:36:28.931 --> 00:36:33.401
<v Speaker 1>off from a contrary ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll last.</v>

634
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was fun about being in a network of</v>

635
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.680
<v Speaker 1>right leaning undergraduates in early 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties?</v>

636
00:36:39.681 --> 00:36:44.681
<v Speaker 1>Oxford was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in constant combat with the left </v>

637
00:36:44.681 --> 00:36:48.271
<v Speaker 1>leaning Marxist that was still real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist is then and we weren't far from </v>

638
00:36:49.581 --> 00:36:54.581
<v Speaker 1>cut off constantly engaging with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the soggies Social Democrats in in </v>

639
00:36:55.341 --> 00:36:57.650
<v Speaker 1>the middle and that was what made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

640
00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:03.310
<v Speaker 1>What I see happening in the networked </v>
<v Speaker 1>age is that people can retreat into a </v>

641
00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:08.540
<v Speaker 1>realm of confirmation bias where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>here only things that are similar to the</v>

642
00:37:08.541 --> 00:37:13.541
<v Speaker 1>things they liked yesterday and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithms are the key here where you </v>

643
00:37:13.541 --> 00:37:18.071
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's youtube or on facebook or </v>

644
00:37:18.071 --> 00:37:18.470
<v Speaker 1>on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are essentially going to be fed more</v>

645
00:37:18.471 --> 00:37:19.790
<v Speaker 1>of what you already liked.</v>

646
00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:25.180
<v Speaker 1>That's deeply intellectually unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just as a university cannot be a </v>

647
00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:29.540
<v Speaker 1>university if everybody agrees about </v>
<v Speaker 1>first ideological principles because how</v>

648
00:37:29.541 --> 00:37:31.580
<v Speaker 1>can you have critical thinking in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment?</v>

649
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:36.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's unhealthy for any intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>network to be Autarkic.</v>

650
00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:41.620
<v Speaker 1>So the one thing the intellectual dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>web must not do is cut itself off from </v>

651
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:46.710
<v Speaker 1>other networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the ones that hate us and when</v>

652
00:37:46.711 --> 00:37:51.410
<v Speaker 1>we have to be in an argument and we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have our minds constantly open to the</v>

653
00:37:51.411 --> 00:37:53.870
<v Speaker 1>possibility that we're wrong about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

654
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:57.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I see more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappearing from public life.</v>

655
00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I recognize this at one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

656
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:01.010
<v Speaker 1>when I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

657
00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:06.020
<v Speaker 1>in mortal combat with Paul Krugman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economists turned journalist and,</v>

658
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:09.260
<v Speaker 1>and realize that recruitment could never</v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that he'd ever been wrong.</v>

659
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:14.530
<v Speaker 1>And then when it was obvious that he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been because he hit his part of his </v>

660
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:18.871
<v Speaker 1>result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dettra was always being right about </v>

661
00:38:18.871 --> 00:38:18.871
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

662
00:38:18.871 --> 00:38:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Did you happen to see the day that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>article came out,</v>

663
00:38:19.601 --> 00:38:22.330
<v Speaker 2>the original intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark web article by Barry?</v>

664
00:38:22.331 --> 00:38:27.331
<v Speaker 2>The day that that came out that Paul </v>
<v Speaker 2>Krugman tweeted it and he tweeted this </v>

665
00:38:27.331 --> 00:38:27.460
<v Speaker 2>thing about how we're also oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:38:27.461 --> 00:38:32.461
<v Speaker 2>just mocking everybody basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a bunch of us responded to him </v>

667
00:38:32.461 --> 00:38:34.450
<v Speaker 2>and I of course retweeted it and invited</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on the show.</v>

668
00:38:34.451 --> 00:38:39.451
<v Speaker 2>I said I'd be to discuss this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and it gets a couple thousand </v>

669
00:38:39.451 --> 00:38:39.451
<v Speaker 2>retweets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course,</v>

670
00:38:39.451 --> 00:38:39.451
<v Speaker 2>no response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

671
00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:44.580
<v Speaker 2>And that you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we have to make sure we </v>

672
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:44.580
<v Speaker 2>don't become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a,</v>

673
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a human trait that would sort of</v>

674
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:51.841
<v Speaker 2>make you want to retreat because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausting having your motives attack.</v>

675
00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:57.691
<v Speaker 2>Then your humanity attacked and lies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>smears and all the things that I don't </v>

676
00:38:57.691 --> 00:38:59.860
<v Speaker 2>see anyone on this side doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

677
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.300
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's an example.</v>

678
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.750
<v Speaker 2>So it's an exhausting fight because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fighting two different battles.</v>

679
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly the same trick</v>

680
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:12.650
<v Speaker 1>award at the moment in the sense that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't recognized that in the culture </v>

681
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:17.001
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that works is </v>

682
00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:17.040
<v Speaker 1>reputational destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

683
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.620
<v Speaker 1>we are guaranteed sleepless nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

684
00:39:19.621 --> 00:39:22.830
<v Speaker 1>there's also the phenomenon of guilty </v>
<v Speaker 1>until proven innocent,</v>

685
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:28.050
<v Speaker 1>which is insidious and means that if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reputational hit is bad enough,</v>

686
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.610
<v Speaker 1>there may be no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

687
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:35.660
<v Speaker 1>there may be no recovery from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very struck by the speed with </v>

688
00:39:35.701 --> 00:39:40.701
<v Speaker 1>which reputations were destroyed in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the me two movements,</v>

689
00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most violent phase a and a </v>

690
00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:51.051
<v Speaker 1>characteristic feature of the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be the men were essentially </v>

691
00:39:51.091 --> 00:39:56.091
<v Speaker 1>guilty until proven innocent and crimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>were conflated with a quite clearly </v>

692
00:39:58.531 --> 00:40:03.531
<v Speaker 1>noncriminal behavior in ways that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply troubling to my eyes.</v>

693
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:07.380
<v Speaker 1>The false accusation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the,</v>

694
00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.760
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate nightmare of anybody in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this world at this time,</v>

695
00:40:12.811 --> 00:40:15.830
<v Speaker 1>because if you're falsely accused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

696
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:20.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your reputation can be gone in 24 hours </v>

697
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.230
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has an emt introduced into our </v>

698
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.570
<v Speaker 1>lives something that hasn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed since medieval times.</v>

699
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling that we are at the mercy of </v>

700
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:35.611
<v Speaker 1>what wheel of fortune that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrarily turn against us and dashes </v>

701
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:41.160
<v Speaker 1>overturn us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this makes the culture war,</v>

702
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:45.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deeply troubling thing to be a part of</v>

703
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:50.690
<v Speaker 1>and most sensible normal people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

704
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I want a quiet life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get me out of here and never involved me</v>

705
00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.600
<v Speaker 1>in any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get me off twitter,</v>

706
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:05.790
<v Speaker 1>get me off facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never let my name appear in the New York</v>

707
00:41:05.791 --> 00:41:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never let me appear on a,</v>

708
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.840
<v Speaker 1>on a show like this because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>too dangerous.</v>

709
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only need to say one thing that can be</v>

710
00:41:16.561 --> 00:41:21.561
<v Speaker 1>taken out of context and represented as </v>
<v Speaker 1>heresy or hate speech as heresy is now </v>

711
00:41:21.561 --> 00:41:26.361
<v Speaker 1>called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we now call heresy and I </v>

712
00:41:26.361 --> 00:41:29.391
<v Speaker 1>will be subjected to potentially a weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vilification and maybe worse,</v>

713
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe the vilification will actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead me to lose my job at.</v>

714
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.810
<v Speaker 1>People are right to be fearful of that.</v>

715
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:41.500
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I mentioned before we had dinner </v>

716
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:41.620
<v Speaker 2>with and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just to illustrate this,</v>

717
00:41:41.621 --> 00:41:42.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you don't even want me to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

718
00:41:42.911 --> 00:41:45.280
<v Speaker 2>but just to illustrate the level of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about.</v>

719
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:50.290
<v Speaker 2>We had a private dinner in a home with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric and his wife and I and you and me </v>

720
00:41:50.891 --> 00:41:51.920
<v Speaker 2>and my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we had.</v>

721
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.220
<v Speaker 2>There were security guards out outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're not.</v>

722
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.160
<v Speaker 2>You're not just saying this stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

723
00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:01.560
<v Speaker 2>This is real stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what Eric has said to me is that </v>

724
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.130
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a bravery element here that</v>

725
00:42:03.131 --> 00:42:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't even consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't consider myself.</v>

726
00:42:04.781 --> 00:42:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm just doing what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is right,</v>

727
00:42:06.821 --> 00:42:09.640
<v Speaker 2>that that really is the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to ask you about that.</v>

728
00:42:09.641 --> 00:42:11.260
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for you,</v>

729
00:42:11.261 --> 00:42:13.600
<v Speaker 2>for ion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just academic.</v>

730
00:42:13.601 --> 00:42:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think the bravery comes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you?</v>

731
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Because I can tell there is nothing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could possibly ask you here that you </v>

732
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:24.331
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't give me the clearest honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer and and that isn't always how it </v>

733
00:42:24.331 --> 00:42:25.180
<v Speaker 2>is with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

734
00:42:25.181 --> 00:42:28.140
<v Speaker 2>As an interviewer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you think that comes from?</v>

735
00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Uganda has always been one of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest weaknesses.</v>

736
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.890
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

737
00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I was probably brought up in a rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>combative family in a rather competence </v>

738
00:42:41.051 --> 00:42:42.200
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in,</v>

739
00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.020
<v Speaker 1>in Glasgow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the west of Scotland,</v>

740
00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:44.650
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

741
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.520
<v Speaker 2>to a physician and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a physics.</v>

742
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.290
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother was a teacher.</v>

743
00:42:49.291 --> 00:42:54.291
<v Speaker 1>My father was a doctor and they were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first in their families to go to </v>

744
00:42:54.421 --> 00:42:55.770
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

745
00:42:55.890 --> 00:43:00.890
<v Speaker 1>my grandfathers had served in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a scots,</v>

746
00:43:01.681 --> 00:43:05.550
<v Speaker 1>have a self image of themselves as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a courageous.</v>

747
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:09.120
<v Speaker 1>The Scottish regiments were famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about this in my,</v>

748
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:14.330
<v Speaker 1>one of my earliest books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prisoner of war were famously the </v>

749
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:15.000
<v Speaker 1>sharp end of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the British military.</v>

750
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we marched towards the sound of gunfire,</v>

751
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 1>bagpipes playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the self image that a,</v>

752
00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 1>a small Scottish boy growing up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 sixties and seventies was encouraged </v>

753
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.651
<v Speaker 1>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember vividly the day that nine </v>

754
00:43:34.351 --> 00:43:37.530
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting in Oxford where I was then</v>

755
00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:42.531
<v Speaker 1>teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but planning I'd planned and was </v>

756
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:45.021
<v Speaker 1>intending to fly to New York a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortly to give a lecture on nine slash </v>

757
00:43:45.391 --> 00:43:47.940
<v Speaker 1>12 at New York University.</v>

758
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was booked into a hotel very close to </v>

759
00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.750
<v Speaker 1>the World Trade Center and my response </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I saw the attacks was somewhat a </v>

760
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:04.750
<v Speaker 1>bloody minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My response was very shortly afterwards </v>

761
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:07.860
<v Speaker 1>to resign my posts at Oxford and go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York University,</v>

762
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:12.890
<v Speaker 1>and I taught there for two years in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose a mood of defiance that the </v>

763
00:44:15.061 --> 00:44:18.030
<v Speaker 1>attempt to terrorize would not terrorize</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

764
00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.780
<v Speaker 1>When I met a on a nine more than nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago now,</v>

765
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:29.610
<v Speaker 1>it never crossed my mind as I fell in </v>
<v Speaker 1>love with her,</v>

766
00:44:29.611 --> 00:44:34.611
<v Speaker 1>which happened very fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this implied some meaningful,</v>

767
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
<v Speaker 1>a threat to my person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when the FBI came to tell me that </v>

768
00:44:42.061 --> 00:44:47.061
<v Speaker 1>there had been a threat against me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I'd seen them due to a </v>

769
00:44:47.061 --> 00:44:50.721
<v Speaker 1>yarn on more than one occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never gave it a second thought because</v>

770
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:57.350
<v Speaker 1>obviously my calling different from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfathers who were called to fight in</v>

771
00:44:58.861 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 1>real wars.</v>

772
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:05.630
<v Speaker 1>My more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more manageable callings to is to </v>

773
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:10.551
<v Speaker 1>protect her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she's one of the great heroines of </v>

774
00:45:10.551 --> 00:45:14.361
<v Speaker 1>our time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extraordinary courageous woman who's </v>

775
00:45:14.361 --> 00:45:17.781
<v Speaker 1>been through a hell of a lot and who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>never shirked from saying what she </v>

776
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:24.891
<v Speaker 1>believes is wrong with modern Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>

777
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:30.390
<v Speaker 1>it is second nature to me to be there </v>
<v Speaker 1>with her in that,</v>

778
00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:32.280
<v Speaker 1>in that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that war.</v>

779
00:45:32.281 --> 00:45:34.500
<v Speaker 1>That's what it turns out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My warm.</v>

780
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I always used to wonder as I was growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

781
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:41.601
<v Speaker 1>why is it that my generation isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really been called on to fight wars the </v>

782
00:45:41.601 --> 00:45:43.650
<v Speaker 1>way my grandfather's generations were </v>
<v Speaker 1>called on,</v>

783
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 1>and then it turned up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then my water turned up.</v>

784
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.910
<v Speaker 2>You briefly mentioned this earlier when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about ion and brandeis,</v>

785
00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:55.911
<v Speaker 2>but can you explain this intersection of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamism and the left?</v>

786
00:45:57.601 --> 00:45:59.550
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why this has occurred.</v>

787
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.330
<v Speaker 2>This confuses a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea of the oppression Olympics and</v>

788
00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got plenty of theories on this that</v>

789
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:06.170
<v Speaker 2>we've knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

790
00:46:06.171 --> 00:46:11.171
<v Speaker 2>but what do you think it is that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted something that is completely </v>

791
00:46:11.171 --> 00:46:14.530
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian and control with another </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's so completely totally.</v>

792
00:46:14.531 --> 00:46:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the answer right there,</v>

793
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

794
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many unholy alliances in,</v>

795
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.740
<v Speaker 1>in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

796
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

797
00:46:21.881 --> 00:46:23.470
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people will gravely,</v>

798
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised when the Ribbentrop Molotov </v>

799
00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.870
<v Speaker 1>pact was announced in the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Nazi Germany,</v>

800
00:46:31.871 --> 00:46:36.871
<v Speaker 1>you formed an alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we shouldn't be entirely surprised </v>

801
00:46:36.871 --> 00:46:40.321
<v Speaker 1>when seemingly odd bedfellows jump into </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed in the case of the Islamists and the</v>

802
00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:50.640
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty clear to me that the</v>

803
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this are the,</v>

804
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 1>the leading partner and the leftists </v>
<v Speaker 1>have broadly the useful idiots because </v>

805
00:47:01.481 --> 00:47:06.481
<v Speaker 1>the Islamists have a strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bare and Muslim Brotherhood and </v>

806
00:47:06.481 --> 00:47:10.501
<v Speaker 1>other documents for expanding their </v>
<v Speaker 1>network in the west.</v>

807
00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:19.260
<v Speaker 1>And part of the strategy is the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a partnership that they have formed on </v>

808
00:47:21.671 --> 00:47:24.580
<v Speaker 1>campuses against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

809
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:29.760
<v Speaker 1>against their foes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way in which this is that you use </v>

810
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.420
<v Speaker 1>the issue of Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

811
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.820
<v Speaker 1>to forge the packs with the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get the left's longstanding </v>

812
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 1>animosity towards Zionism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

813
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.870
<v Speaker 1>and you essentially say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

814
00:47:43.871 --> 00:47:45.760
<v Speaker 1>we entirely agree with you about that.</v>

815
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have an event about how wicked </v>

816
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Israel is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the gateway drug into </v>

817
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:58.081
<v Speaker 1>accepting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is well headscarves or </v>

818
00:47:58.081 --> 00:47:58.360
<v Speaker 1>actually empowering for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>

819
00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:03.640
<v Speaker 1>A and isn't actually Islamophobia to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in any way critical of sharia law.</v>

820
00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:09.420
<v Speaker 1>So you play the multiculturalists </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural relativist card and you again </v>

821
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.570
<v Speaker 1>depict any critics of radical Islam as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is in fact,</v>

822
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:18.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in some kind of orientalist </v>

823
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:22.171
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a or essentialist project to other </v>

824
00:48:22.171 --> 00:48:23.500
<v Speaker 1>people always talk about othering in </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia,</v>

825
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:28.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims and you blur the distinction </v>

826
00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:29.650
<v Speaker 1>between Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

827
00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:34.651
<v Speaker 1>Islam and Muslims as people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this has been going on for awhile and</v>

828
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.000
<v Speaker 1>the left as broadly fallen for it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

829
00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just astonishing.</v>

830
00:48:40.481 --> 00:48:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I remember looking at the list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>academics who had,</v>

831
00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:47.230
<v Speaker 1>who had argued that they aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should not receive an honorary degree at</v>

832
00:48:47.231 --> 00:48:52.231
<v Speaker 1>Brandeis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it included professors of Queer </v>

833
00:48:52.231 --> 00:48:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a female professors of gender studies.</v>

834
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:58.980
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of feel like saying to these </v>

835
00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.291
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you taken a look at what the Muslim</v>

836
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Brotherhood envisages have you read </v>
<v Speaker 1>works?</v>

837
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you realize that the project is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent demotion of women to second </v>

838
00:49:10.571 --> 00:49:15.130
<v Speaker 1>class status and potentially a capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment for gays?</v>

839
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that something you are aware of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can only conclude that they aren't</v>

840
00:49:21.101 --> 00:49:26.101
<v Speaker 1>aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And have been very thoroughly duped as </v>

841
00:49:26.101 --> 00:49:26.200
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idiots usually are.</v>

842
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:30.340
<v Speaker 1>So is that basically because both of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these movements wind power,</v>

843
00:49:30.341 --> 00:49:35.341
<v Speaker 1>so the useful idiot part of this is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam is a really just using the left </v>

844
00:49:35.341 --> 00:49:39.901
<v Speaker 1>who attain power and they're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all in the name of diversity and all of </v>

845
00:49:39.901 --> 00:49:39.901
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And eventually,</v>

846
00:49:39.901 --> 00:49:43.290
<v Speaker 1>once that power is attained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then for lack of a better expression,</v>

847
00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically decapitate them and then </v>

848
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:48.310
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did it for you.</v>

849
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:48.730
<v Speaker 1>They did the work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

850
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:52.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always used to joke with a on that,</v>

851
00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we lived in Cambridge,</v>

852
00:49:54.221 --> 00:49:59.221
<v Speaker 1>it would be fun if all my enemies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all her enemies came and protested </v>

853
00:49:59.471 --> 00:50:04.471
<v Speaker 1>outside our house together because after</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 20 minutes and they'd fall on one </v>

854
00:50:05.591 --> 00:50:08.050
<v Speaker 1>another and they would have the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous fight.</v>

855
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I do think that power is part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if one looks back at the history of </v>

856
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:20.080
<v Speaker 1>another intolerant to Talla Terry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology of Marxism,</v>

857
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:25.220
<v Speaker 1>that there's a combination of power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

858
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:30.440
<v Speaker 1>a kind of idealism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One must call it that in the square and </v>

859
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:35.591
<v Speaker 1>the tower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell the story of how the Soviet </v>

860
00:50:35.591 --> 00:50:37.751
<v Speaker 1>successfully penetrated the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment by recruiting spies and </v>

861
00:50:39.141 --> 00:50:44.141
<v Speaker 1>Cambridge and the people they recruited </v>
<v Speaker 1>had leanings to the left that were </v>

862
00:50:44.781 --> 00:50:49.781
<v Speaker 1>inspired partly by revulsion at those </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of of British imperialism or </v>

863
00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:55.260
<v Speaker 1>British society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that word in many ways a legitimately </v>

864
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.470
<v Speaker 1>open to criticism.</v>

865
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:02.660
<v Speaker 1>There was an idealism there at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of guide Burgess's involvement</v>

866
00:51:02.661 --> 00:51:05.930
<v Speaker 1>in Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathy with workers during the time of</v>

867
00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:10.931
<v Speaker 1>the Great Depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those were the useful idiots that </v>

868
00:51:10.931 --> 00:51:12.890
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet cynically recruited to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>spies who,</v>

869
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:17.950
<v Speaker 1>whom they persuaded to betray their </v>
<v Speaker 1>countrymen in what was the single most </v>

870
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:22.451
<v Speaker 1>successful act of of Russian espionage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mobile recruiting.</v>

871
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:27.320
<v Speaker 1>These highly educated people from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>credibly exclusive network,</v>

872
00:51:27.321 --> 00:51:31.730
<v Speaker 1>the Cambridge Apostles and the related </v>
<v Speaker 1>network that led to Bloomsburg.</v>

873
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.880
<v Speaker 1>This was a brilliant strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something similar is going on here </v>

874
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.810
<v Speaker 1>because I think there are a great many </v>
<v Speaker 1>naive young people who are drawn to the </v>

875
00:51:40.911 --> 00:51:43.700
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric of social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I encountered them often.</v>

876
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.320
<v Speaker 1>People who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

877
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:50.470
<v Speaker 1>there should be limits on free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want such and such a </v>

878
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:52.400
<v Speaker 1>such and such as feelings to be hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're naive,</v>

879
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:57.790
<v Speaker 1>they have a very naive view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow there can be a circumscribed </v>

880
00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:00.020
<v Speaker 1>form of free speech and no in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's feelings get hurt.</v>

881
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:05.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not the pursuit of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just naive city and the people </v>

882
00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:10.511
<v Speaker 1>who know how to explain that naive 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>are both people amongst the Islamists </v>

883
00:52:10.511 --> 00:52:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and people amongst the leftists who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing power,</v>

884
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:18.250
<v Speaker 1>but you can never really get to power </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the useful idiots without the </v>

885
00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:21.530
<v Speaker 1>naive idealists who think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to build utopia with your help.</v>

886
00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't have to tell you,</v>

887
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:25.880
<v Speaker 1>they're usually ends up in Dystopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

888
00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:27.890
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

889
00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:31.850
<v Speaker 1>that's something that it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>persuade people of y'all keep reflecting</v>

890
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:36.851
<v Speaker 1>on the curious revival of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Margaret Atwood's the handmaid's </v>

891
00:52:36.851 --> 00:52:41.230
<v Speaker 1>tale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is always taken to be a vision of </v>

892
00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:43.480
<v Speaker 1>what happens when right wing people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

893
00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:45.920
<v Speaker 1>take over America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>

894
00:52:45.921 --> 00:52:50.921
<v Speaker 1>the amazing thing that is almost never </v>
<v Speaker 1>observed is that something very like </v>

895
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.060
<v Speaker 1>this has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

896
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:58.270
<v Speaker 1>it happened in Iran after 1979 and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened after the Taliban came to power</v>

897
00:52:58.461 --> 00:52:59.360
<v Speaker 1>in Afghanistan.</v>

898
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.640
<v Speaker 1>So we don't need to fantasize about </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy evangelical fascists turning women</v>

899
00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.730
<v Speaker 1>into baby machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has already happened,</v>

900
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.880
<v Speaker 1>but it was done by Islam as it was done </v>
<v Speaker 1>by people pursuing an extreme version </v>

901
00:53:13.071 --> 00:53:13.400
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

902
00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:17.510
<v Speaker 1>of Sharia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet almost nobody who enthuses about</v>

903
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Atwood's book realizes that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually really quite powerful </v>

904
00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.611
<v Speaker 1>realization of what a theocratic Islam </v>
<v Speaker 1>this regime does to women.</v>

905
00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:33.520
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to shift gears a little bit </v>

906
00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:33.520
<v Speaker 1>here and we can either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let you choose.</v>

907
00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.090
<v Speaker 1>We can either go the historical root or </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can go to the president route.</v>

908
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:38.970
<v Speaker 1>What are you feeling first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to do both.</v>

909
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I think the key to apply to history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I've spent my whole life </v>

910
00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:45.780
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you do both and you can't do one</v>

911
00:53:45.781 --> 00:53:48.900
<v Speaker 1>without the other because no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have no real insight about the</v>

912
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 1>present without the past.</v>

913
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:55.430
<v Speaker 1>So why don't we talk about the president</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll try to show why to understand </v>

914
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:56.010
<v Speaker 1>that you need history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

915
00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:57.090
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

916
00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:02.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a couple of things that are </v>

917
00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.981
<v Speaker 1>interesting that you've staked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions out over the past couple of </v>

918
00:54:03.981 --> 00:54:03.981
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

919
00:54:03.981 --> 00:54:04.680
<v Speaker 1>we briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before we sat down,</v>

920
00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:09.450
<v Speaker 1>we talked about brexit for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you originally were for,</v>

921
00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:10.610
<v Speaker 1>were against brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

922
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Then you came around for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems to be in this odd limbo </v>

923
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.240
<v Speaker 1>that I think unfortunately most people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in America don't even understand what's,</v>

924
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.310
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think most people in Britain,</v>

925
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:22.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

926
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:24.710
<v Speaker 1>so when I was reading your position on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

927
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.740
<v Speaker 1>at first I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

928
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:30.741
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a conservative and as someone that </v>

929
00:54:30.741 --> 00:54:32.130
<v Speaker 1>wants some autonomy over his country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was somewhat surprised actually,</v>

930
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:37.370
<v Speaker 1>that you weren't for it originally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you explain to your original </v>

931
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.370
<v Speaker 1>position and then how you changed on it?</v>

932
00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:43.020
<v Speaker 1>The two reasons why I was on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>remain remain in the EU,</v>

933
00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:45.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in 2016.</v>

934
00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:49.930
<v Speaker 1>One was pure personal loyalty to friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

935
00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:55.130
<v Speaker 1>David Cameron was prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Osborne was chancellor of the </v>

936
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Exchequer and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

937
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:59.660
<v Speaker 1>friends of mine and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt obliged as a friend to support </v>

938
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:04.941
<v Speaker 1>them when they decided to stick with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>EU or not to recommend brexit.</v>

939
00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Did that friendship supersede what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings were or was that because you </v>

940
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:12.630
<v Speaker 1>really trusted what they could get into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swung it.</v>

941
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason that I was </v>

942
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.300
<v Speaker 1>willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get on board with Romaine was that I </v>

943
00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.950
<v Speaker 1>found the arguments of the brexiteers </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply unconvincing.</v>

944
00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I remember one night sitting down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a lot of stuff by Daniel Hannan,</v>

945
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the advocates of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

946
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:36.440
<v Speaker 1>of leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking that this was </v>

947
00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:39.471
<v Speaker 1>just intellectually completely a foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>class and unconvincing the,</v>

948
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:45.230
<v Speaker 1>the notion that Britain would be better </v>
<v Speaker 1>off economically outside the European </v>

949
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Union wouldn't have passed muster as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an undergraduate paper,</v>

950
00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:50.730
<v Speaker 1>another undergraduate paper.</v>

951
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:56.150
<v Speaker 1>So I felt that the brexiteers case </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed intellectually because they were </v>

952
00:55:56.671 --> 00:56:01.671
<v Speaker 1>claiming implausibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that you could have a free </v>

953
00:56:01.671 --> 00:56:05.781
<v Speaker 1>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could leave the European Union </v>

954
00:56:05.781 --> 00:56:07.611
<v Speaker 1>and be better off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that just seems to me to be </v>

955
00:56:07.611 --> 00:56:10.311
<v Speaker 1>intellectually completely deceitful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would have been harder for me</v>

956
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.420
<v Speaker 1>if they had said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

957
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:17.720
<v Speaker 1>this is going to cost quite a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth it because if we leave </v>

958
00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:25.070
<v Speaker 1>then we shall have the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control our borders and we shall have a </v>

959
00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:33.330
<v Speaker 1>autonomy at a time when Europe is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing a federalists course.</v>

960
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:39.480
<v Speaker 1>But that wasn't the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The argument was that not the argument </v>

961
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday get the money.</v>

962
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:43.750
<v Speaker 1>This was the argument you had to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money that we give to the European Union</v>

963
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:48.810
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to be able to spend on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the national health service because we </v>

964
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:48.810
<v Speaker 1>will be in fact better off.</v>

965
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And that was a lie and I'm not good with</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies.</v>

966
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:53.230
<v Speaker 1>It was a clever line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It worked politically.</v>

967
00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:58.530
<v Speaker 1>And I give credit to Dominic Cummings </v>
<v Speaker 1>for crafting a message that was a pd </v>

968
00:56:58.530 --> 00:56:59.590
<v Speaker 1>both to conservatives and to Labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>voters.</v>

969
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:01.900
<v Speaker 1>The Conservatives got immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

970
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Labor voters got the national health </v>
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>

971
00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:06.220
<v Speaker 1>gets the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is brilliant politically,</v>

972
00:57:06.221 --> 00:57:08.380
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't mendacious I think at </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>

973
00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I opposed the brexit when it happened.</v>

974
00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what struck me in the subsequent months </v>

975
00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:25.530
<v Speaker 1>was that while I had been one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been on the side that last,</v>

976
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:32.670
<v Speaker 1>there was a good reason why we lost and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good reason was that we went around </v>

977
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.460
<v Speaker 1>saying how much it was going to cost and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we were right about that.</v>

978
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:38.890
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately at least some of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Treasury said,</v>

979
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:41.920
<v Speaker 1>well will turn out to be true about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost,</v>

980
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:46.850
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't what people cared about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you went into pubs as I did in,</v>

981
00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.910
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Wales and England and in Scotland,</v>

982
00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:55.020
<v Speaker 1>there was a question to which you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>not give an honest answer without losing</v>

983
00:57:55.241 --> 00:57:57.940
<v Speaker 1>the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you what that question was</v>

984
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:03.420
<v Speaker 1>because I was asked it multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd make the case about the cost.</v>

985
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was interested in the cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would say,</v>

986
00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:10.360
<v Speaker 1>listen Neil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the one point 3 million Muslims,</v>

987
00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:14.470
<v Speaker 1>the Germans have just let in to Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that had just happened.</v>

988
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:17.830
<v Speaker 1>If the Germans give them German </v>
<v Speaker 1>passports,</v>

989
00:58:17.831 --> 00:58:18.670
<v Speaker 1>can they come here?</v>

990
00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.970
<v Speaker 1>And the only honest answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question was yes.</v>

991
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:30.020
<v Speaker 1>So immigration was the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think for a significant number of </v>

992
00:58:30.601 --> 00:58:35.220
<v Speaker 1>people in England and Wales especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>was less so in Scotland where brexit was</v>

993
00:58:35.221 --> 00:58:35.760
<v Speaker 1>defeated.</v>

994
00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:42.290
<v Speaker 1>The realization was that Britain had </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost control of immigration.</v>

995
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:49.910
<v Speaker 1>The people had been promised net </v>
<v Speaker 1>migration in the tens of thousands in </v>

996
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:51.810
<v Speaker 1>the 19 nineties under the Blair </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

997
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.290
<v Speaker 1>and they'd ended up with net migration </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the hundreds of thousands,</v>

998
00:58:55.590 --> 00:59:00.590
<v Speaker 1>they saw the chaos in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They saw the waves of migration coming </v>

999
00:59:00.901 --> 00:59:03.790
<v Speaker 1>on in different Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from all over North Africa and uh,</v>

1000
00:59:03.791 --> 00:59:05.910
<v Speaker 1>and even so Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

1001
00:59:05.911 --> 00:59:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and I remember David Cameron using this </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase,</v>

1002
00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:10.710
<v Speaker 1>get me out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

1003
00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:14.250
<v Speaker 1>that was the driving motivation for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brexit vote.</v>

1004
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:19.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was legitimate because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that Anglia Merkle had made a </v>

1005
00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:20.970
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic mistake and throwing open </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gates.</v>

1006
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it will have consequences for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future of Germany and of Europe.</v>

1007
00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:30.280
<v Speaker 1>And I do not blame British voters for </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying forget about the cost of brexit.</v>

1008
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.740
<v Speaker 1>We really need to get out of this.</v>

1009
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:38.660
<v Speaker 1>So I take the view by the end of 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had to,</v>

1010
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.620
<v Speaker 1>you had to respect the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people had cut through the crap</v>

1011
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:47.621
<v Speaker 1>of the debate and it got to the heart of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the matter and the heart of the matter </v>

1012
00:59:47.621 --> 00:59:50.630
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the cost of Brexit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I had,</v>

1013
00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I think mistakenly focused on prior to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the referendum.</v>

1014
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:58.930
<v Speaker 1>What was it like for you as a public </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and someone that writes about </v>

1015
00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.010
<v Speaker 1>this stuff and put your opinions out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that have that realization?</v>

1016
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important if you write</v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly,</v>

1017
01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.920
<v Speaker 1>if you are what we call a public </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>

1018
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.040
<v Speaker 1>a to be willing to admit that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been wrong.</v>

1019
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to be prepared to say I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was wrong and I.</v>

1020
01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>I think I was wrong in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I wish I had done looking back was.</v>

1021
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had said to David Cameron and </v>
<v Speaker 1>George Osborne in the spring of 2016 </v>

1022
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:36.160
<v Speaker 1>when it was clear that the Europeans </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to make no meaningful </v>

1023
01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.971
<v Speaker 1>concession on the immigration issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they basically sent an insulting </v>

1024
01:00:39.971 --> 01:00:42.770
<v Speaker 1>proposal about what could be done about </v>
<v Speaker 1>migration,</v>

1025
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>that was the moment I should have said </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cameron and Osborne,</v>

1026
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1027
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>you should campaign for Brexit if that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they're going to offer you.</v>

1028
01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:56.350
<v Speaker 1>If they're so completely oblivious to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very real concerns about </v>

1029
01:00:56.350 --> 01:01:00.911
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should campaign for brexit </v>

1030
01:01:00.911 --> 01:01:01.670
<v Speaker 1>instead of which we stuck with it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>

1031
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>That was David Cameron's great mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should have said at that moment if </v>

1032
01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.511
<v Speaker 1>that's all you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to recommend brexit to the </v>

1033
01:01:10.511 --> 01:01:10.511
<v Speaker 1>voters and it would have saved him too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1034
01:01:10.511 --> 01:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>So you think it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a bad negotiating play that </v>

1035
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.101
<v Speaker 1>he just didn't use some leverage to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to walk away from </v>

1036
01:01:18.101 --> 01:01:18.101
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1037
01:01:18.101 --> 01:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a moment when he should have </v>

1038
01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>walked away and I should have advised </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to walk away.</v>

1039
01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one has to recognize when </v>

1040
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>someone's made a mistake with such </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

1041
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>The second thing which is worth knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this is that the people who then </v>

1042
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>inherited power after the fall of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cameron and Osborne,</v>

1043
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>we're not the people who had campaigned </v>
<v Speaker 1>for and one on racks and it was people </v>

1044
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>who had been on the remain side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theresa may became prime minister.</v>

1045
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always knew that would be a disaster.</v>

1046
01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I did not have high regard for her prior</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the referendum.</v>

1047
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:56.300
<v Speaker 1>The Daily Mail essentially put her in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that position and also Boris Johnson,</v>

1048
01:01:56.301 --> 01:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Michael Gove and others because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>bungled the leadership contest.</v>

1049
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:05.620
<v Speaker 1>So we then ended up with a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination which was a commitment to </v>

1050
01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:10.061
<v Speaker 1>Brexit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's execution in the hands of </v>

1051
01:02:10.061 --> 01:02:10.790
<v Speaker 1>people who had been remainers.</v>

1052
01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:16.240
<v Speaker 1>And I think the result is the worst of </v>
<v Speaker 1>both worlds because right now we </v>

1053
01:02:16.341 --> 01:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>essentially have the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of brexit.</v>

1054
01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I think British public to a large extent</v>
<v Speaker 1>has accepted that we are leaving,</v>

1055
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>but the execution is a total mess by </v>
<v Speaker 1>invoking article 50 early on the UK in </v>

1056
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>essentially seated the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power and the divorce to the </v>

1057
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the concessions have come one after </v>

1058
01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.251
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever since then and we now find </v>

1059
01:02:46.251 --> 01:02:49.671
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in the odd predicament that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think Theresa May is saying that brexit </v>

1060
01:02:49.671 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>means you ceased to be a voting member </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the European Union,</v>

1061
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>but you remain within the customs union </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially even within the single </v>

1062
01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.170
<v Speaker 1>market and you accept all the rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations of the European Union.</v>

1063
01:03:01.171 --> 01:03:03.960
<v Speaker 1>You just don't have any power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the end game,</v>

1064
01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:09.120
<v Speaker 1>then it's a disaster so that the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are trying to stop this now,</v>

1065
01:03:09.121 --> 01:03:12.960
<v Speaker 1>they want to invoke some some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy extreme stuff.</v>

1066
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there would be some really,</v>

1067
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:20.240
<v Speaker 1>very rarely if ever used rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I right about this that would </v>

1068
01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.480
<v Speaker 1>actually allow this to allow the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>to occur.</v>

1069
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1070
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without getting into all of them,</v>

1071
01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I knew that there is a level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity in the discussions now in </v>

1072
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.621
<v Speaker 1>London that is bewildering to most </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary procedure people when people </v>

1073
01:03:33.621 --> 01:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>start talking about Max Faq and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>customs union complex.</v>

1074
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1075
01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:43.581
<v Speaker 1>Because I discussed it with Douglas </v>
<v Speaker 1>Murray and he was even a little </v>

1076
01:03:43.581 --> 01:03:45.711
<v Speaker 1>confused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's actually not confusing in the </v>

1077
01:03:45.711 --> 01:03:48.291
<v Speaker 1>sense that what is happening is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Theresa May is trying to get Britain to </v>

1078
01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:52.611
<v Speaker 1>accept the realities of a belonging to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the European customs union,</v>

1079
01:03:53.551 --> 01:03:56.310
<v Speaker 1>which would preclude Britain having its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own trade policy,</v>

1080
01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:01.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our leaving the European Union's </v>

1081
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:03.720
<v Speaker 1>decision making body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So essentially in that version,</v>

1082
01:04:03.721 --> 01:04:06.810
<v Speaker 1>brexit is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the responsibilities,</v>

1083
01:04:06.811 --> 01:04:10.500
<v Speaker 1>you just don't have any power anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is definitely not what the British</v>

1084
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:13.980
<v Speaker 1>public was told that it was getting in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in brexit.</v>

1085
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1086
01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:19.170
<v Speaker 1>the bigger problem in my mind is not one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1087
01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>that we've discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is that all of this will end in</v>

1088
01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:25.890
<v Speaker 1>tears to the point at which Jeremy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Corbyn,</v>

1089
01:04:25.891 --> 01:04:29.430
<v Speaker 1>the most left wing leader of the Labour </v>
<v Speaker 1>party has ever had in its history,</v>

1090
01:04:29.431 --> 01:04:34.431
<v Speaker 1>becomes prime minister because Theresa </v>
<v Speaker 1>May is leading the country towards this </v>

1091
01:04:35.851 --> 01:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>very unhappy compromise at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who truly believe in Brexit,</v>

1092
01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Jacob Riis smog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1093
01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps Michael Gove,</v>

1094
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may decide when we can't ultimately</v>

1095
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.730
<v Speaker 1>accept this and the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may fall.</v>

1096
01:04:50.731 --> 01:04:53.040
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is that if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government falls,</v>

1097
01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:56.010
<v Speaker 1>then Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1098
01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:01.040
<v Speaker 1>if the government doesn't fall and we go</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way to the finishing line with </v>

1099
01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.030
<v Speaker 1>this Theresa May version of Brexit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think the Conservatives will lose</v>

1100
01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:08.031
<v Speaker 1>the next election in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 and Jeremy Corbyn will be prime </v>

1101
01:05:08.031 --> 01:05:11.361
<v Speaker 1>minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the worst are about brexit is in my </v>

1102
01:05:11.361 --> 01:05:15.741
<v Speaker 1>view that if it is bungled in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will open the door to a truly leftist</v>

1103
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>government and that will be far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically damaging than anything </v>

1104
01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>brexit has done.</v>

1105
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's the nightmare scenario for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1106
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:30.340
<v Speaker 1>And probably socially damaging and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures zillion other reasons deeply.</v>

1107
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>We should be extremely suspicious of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Corbyn and his people.</v>

1108
01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:39.570
<v Speaker 1>They are committed Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been on the wrong side of every </v>

1109
01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>issue in my lifetime with a possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>exception of South African apartheid.</v>

1110
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:48.150
<v Speaker 1>And I do not trust them with the keys to</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 Downing Street because I think that </v>

1111
01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>their ultimate agenda is a truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary one,</v>

1112
01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it poses a threat to the fundamental</v>

1113
01:05:54.671 --> 01:05:57.250
<v Speaker 1>liberties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditions of the constitution.</v>

1114
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous prospect.</v>

1115
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.720
<v Speaker 1>And I'm much more worried about carbon </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1116
01:06:01.721 --> 01:06:02.320
<v Speaker 1>about brexit.</v>

1117
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:07.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how I feel about what's </v>

1118
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:09.191
<v Speaker 2>happening with our left in America to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you guys are giving us basically </v>

1119
01:06:09.191 --> 01:06:09.191
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

1120
01:06:09.191 --> 01:06:13.600
<v Speaker 1>cursor to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the lessons of history </v>

1121
01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.890
<v Speaker 1>and now we can bring history in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that with populism,</v>

1122
01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:19.891
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get two flavors in a typical </v>

1123
01:06:19.891 --> 01:06:21.910
<v Speaker 1>backlash that would come after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis.</v>

1124
01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the political establishment discredited.</v>

1125
01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:31.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a backlash against inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1126
01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.700
<v Speaker 1>all of the things that typically follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>a financial crisis.</v>

1127
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.300
<v Speaker 1>But there are two possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the populism of the left,</v>

1128
01:06:37.301 --> 01:06:40.240
<v Speaker 1>which is the tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rich solution,</v>

1129
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:46.170
<v Speaker 1>but the populism of the writers more </v>
<v Speaker 1>potent because it says that it's about </v>

1130
01:06:46.271 --> 01:06:47.800
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about globalization,</v>

1131
01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:51.720
<v Speaker 1>it's about free trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so broadly speaking,</v>

1132
01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:55.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a very good study that shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>this afro big financial crises,</v>

1133
01:06:55.181 --> 01:07:00.181
<v Speaker 1>the populace of the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do better because they offer a more </v>

1134
01:07:00.181 --> 01:07:02.581
<v Speaker 1>plausible story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they don't deliver when they </v>

1135
01:07:02.581 --> 01:07:06.931
<v Speaker 1>generally don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because quite hard to make immigration </v>

1136
01:07:06.931 --> 01:07:09.811
<v Speaker 1>control and terrorists pay quite hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually to make your constituents </v>

1137
01:07:09.811 --> 01:07:14.701
<v Speaker 1>better off with those policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the pendulum has a tendency to </v>

1138
01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:18.151
<v Speaker 1>swing to the populism of the left and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has happened in Britain really </v>

1139
01:07:18.151 --> 01:07:20.320
<v Speaker 1>quick because Corbyn became popular very</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon after brexit.</v>

1140
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>It's slower here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fear must be that are.</v>

1141
01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:31.530
<v Speaker 1>If the trump experiment goes as wrong as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of of intellectual to </v>

1142
01:07:31.991 --> 01:07:36.991
<v Speaker 1>expect it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pendulum will swing to the left of </v>

1143
01:07:36.991 --> 01:07:40.891
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that scenario seems to me more and </v>

1144
01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:43.270
<v Speaker 1>more plausible are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that's a.</v>

1145
01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:46.030
<v Speaker 1>that's a not an appetizing then.</v>

1146
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:51.750
<v Speaker 2>That's genuinely scary to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I want to back up for one second </v>

1147
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:54.901
<v Speaker 2>because the moment that you had that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said a few times happened in these </v>

1148
01:07:54.901 --> 01:07:56.680
<v Speaker 2>pubs when you would go there and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say this about one point 3 million</v>

1149
01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Muslims in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Germany.</v>

1150
01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:00.580
<v Speaker 2>How do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1151
01:08:00.581 --> 01:08:05.581
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you were listening to the </v>

1152
01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.141
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would say these people are all </v>

1153
01:08:07.141 --> 01:08:07.141
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they would tell you.</v>

1154
01:08:07.141 --> 01:08:07.300
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're racists and they're bigots.</v>

1155
01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that's not what you think of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

1156
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:15.120
<v Speaker 2>although there probably was a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of people that are just racist </v>

1157
01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.000
<v Speaker 2>and don't like people have a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>color or a different culture.</v>

1158
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:23.170
<v Speaker 2>How do you even have that conversation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what so much of this is </v>

1159
01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:26.591
<v Speaker 2>about because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we'd have a pint with these </v>

1160
01:08:26.591 --> 01:08:26.630
<v Speaker 2>people and you'd talk to them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that they weren't racist.</v>

1161
01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 2>They were actually just worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their future,</v>

1162
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:35.050
<v Speaker 2>which is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can't have that discussion </v>

1163
01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:35.720
<v Speaker 2>because every time you open your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell you you're racist.</v>

1164
01:08:35.721 --> 01:08:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Well then we know what you end up with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1165
01:08:38.811 --> 01:08:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I would be a very strange</v>

1166
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:46.910
<v Speaker 1>if I took a bigoted view on this subject</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm an immigrant.</v>

1167
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about to become an American </v>

1168
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.110
<v Speaker 1>citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1169
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:57.410
<v Speaker 1>in a matter of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife was a refugee who got from </v>

1170
01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Somalia originally to the Netherlands by</v>
<v Speaker 1>applying for asylum.</v>

1171
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we would be the last couple to </v>

1172
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:14.421
<v Speaker 1>take a kind of a bigoted view on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration issue because we're </v>

1173
01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:19.560
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I had conversations on this subject</v>

1174
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:23.380
<v Speaker 1>at the time of the brexit referendum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember realizing that the opposition</v>

1175
01:09:23.381 --> 01:09:28.381
<v Speaker 1>to immigration was not plausibly a </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist because I remember somebody </v>

1176
01:09:30.931 --> 01:09:35.931
<v Speaker 1>making the point that he was as worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the people from Lithuania and </v>

1177
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Poland coming to Britain as he was about</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from Syria and Iraq.</v>

1178
01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you probably know that people from </v>

1179
01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Poland and Lithuania are pretty wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing,</v>

1180
01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:55.490
<v Speaker 1>what we all read to recognize is that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration shoots up,</v>

1181
01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:00.030
<v Speaker 1>if it grows from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the case of Britain,</v>

1182
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:02.330
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or $20,000</v>

1183
01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.800
<v Speaker 1>a year to 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 300,000</v>

1184
01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:08.970
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly unprejudiced,</v>

1185
01:10:08.971 --> 01:10:11.370
<v Speaker 1>people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too much.</v>

1186
01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:16.970
<v Speaker 1>This is going too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that I think was the dominant </v>

1187
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:21.350
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there are people who are </v>

1188
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:25.310
<v Speaker 1>racists in any society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the striking thing about Britain is </v>

1189
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:26.310
<v Speaker 1>actually that it's not a terribly racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1190
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Did you see many people protesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Prince Harry's decision to marry</v>

1191
01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:35.190
<v Speaker 1>an American of mixed mixed race?</v>

1192
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I was there a couple of days before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivery.</v>

1193
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were</v>

1194
01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:43.130
<v Speaker 1>huge crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This matches extraordinary popular with </v>

1195
01:10:43.201 --> 01:10:48.201
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's hard to argue that </v>

1196
01:10:48.201 --> 01:10:50.750
<v Speaker 1>racism played any meaningful part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1197
01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:51.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1198
01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.140
<v Speaker 1>the white supremacist element in Britain</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really,</v>

1199
01:10:55.290 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 1>is really very insignificant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually one of the ways in which </v>

1200
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:02.760
<v Speaker 1>the British like to define themselves is</v>
<v Speaker 1>as being tolerant,</v>

1201
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:08.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memories of the war of not entirely </v>

1202
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:09.330
<v Speaker 1>faded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even as the wartime generation gradually</v>

1203
01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:13.690
<v Speaker 1>disappears from the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the war against apart?</v>

1204
01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>It was a war against the ultimate racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1205
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 1>What her Jeremy Corbyn the most in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last three or four months.</v>

1206
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.120
<v Speaker 1>The evidence that there are antisemitic </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements within his faction of the Labor</v>

1207
01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:31.281
<v Speaker 1>left that hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's important that that argument </v>

1208
01:11:31.281 --> 01:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>being made because it has real truth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1209
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think ordinary people think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no good.</v>

1210
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.420
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is not really about </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>

1211
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:47.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not about bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about how rapidly should </v>

1212
01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.690
<v Speaker 1>immigration occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how large should flows be across </v>

1213
01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 1>borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the lesson of history is that if you</v>

1214
01:11:51.691 --> 01:11:56.691
<v Speaker 1>allow a real surge in immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be a populous backlash </v>

1215
01:11:56.691 --> 01:12:00.321
<v Speaker 1>against us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened in the United States in </v>

1216
01:12:00.321 --> 01:12:01.190
<v Speaker 1>the late 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the peak in the 18 eighties,</v>

1217
01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:06.230
<v Speaker 1>the foreign born percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population in the US was about 14 </v>

1218
01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:07.590
<v Speaker 1>percent and gone up from relatively low </v>
<v Speaker 1>level to about 14 percent.</v>

1219
01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Same thing has happened in our time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was down I think below seven percent </v>

1220
01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:17.901
<v Speaker 1>in the mid 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the period after World War Two </v>

1221
01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:21.290
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a relatively small proportion of </v>

1222
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:23.070
<v Speaker 1>neat foreign born citizens were pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>small portion of the US population.</v>

1223
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.280
<v Speaker 1>And then from the 19 eighties onwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proportion surged and the character </v>

1224
01:12:29.371 --> 01:12:31.630
<v Speaker 1>of the immigrants changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1225
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:33.900
<v Speaker 1>the places that they came from change.</v>

1226
01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.570
<v Speaker 1>And these changes are bound to elicit a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

1227
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:41.630
<v Speaker 1>It always happens and it's not enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people in the liberal elites who by </v>

1228
01:12:42.271 --> 01:12:45.900
<v Speaker 1>and large don't live in areas where </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants come to say,</v>

1229
01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:50.590
<v Speaker 1>what a terrible deplorable bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chauvinists you are for not wanting a,</v>

1230
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:55.700
<v Speaker 1>for not wanting more immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's simply that simply historically </v>

1231
01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:55.920
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1232
01:12:55.921 --> 01:12:59.910
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing that stupid about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this in the United States is a,</v>

1233
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.390
<v Speaker 1>the people on the left who want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimize illegal immigration.</v>

1234
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for many people who were </v>

1235
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:09.600
<v Speaker 1>attracted to trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue was the illegal quality of the</v>

1236
01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:14.601
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rule of law is a big deal in the </v>

1237
01:13:14.601 --> 01:13:17.331
<v Speaker 1>English speaking world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people don't like to hear anything </v>

1238
01:13:17.331 --> 01:13:20.340
<v Speaker 1>that simply says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amnesty for lawbreakers,</v>

1239
01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.790
<v Speaker 1>or if you're a law abiding citizen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll suddenly told,</v>

1240
01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:27.920
<v Speaker 1>well yet the law applies to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are these other people it's </v>

1241
01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:27.920
<v Speaker 1>not going to apply to.</v>

1242
01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Then your natural reaction is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screw this.</v>

1243
01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:31.170
<v Speaker 1>That's why I thought one of his best </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>

1244
01:13:31.171 --> 01:13:36.171
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't use it as much anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but during the campaign were either a </v>

1245
01:13:36.171 --> 01:13:37.590
<v Speaker 1>country or we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought was a really effective line.</v>

1246
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 1>You either have laws or you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1247
01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:44.841
<v Speaker 1>that in essence is the true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's shift to trump a little bit </v>

1248
01:13:44.841 --> 01:13:44.841
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1249
01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're kind of in a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot with him,</v>

1250
01:13:48.001 --> 01:13:50.340
<v Speaker 1>which is that it's better than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>

1251
01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.010
<v Speaker 1>that that's certainly how I feel at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1252
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:58.310
<v Speaker 1>that all of the forces that we've spent </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last hour plus talking about would </v>

1253
01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:02.721
<v Speaker 1>be that much more emboldened against </v>
<v Speaker 1>free thought and all and free expression</v>

1254
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:08.830
<v Speaker 1>and open inquiry and all the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we care about and historical fact and,</v>

1255
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:12.580
<v Speaker 1>and everything else if he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

1256
01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:17.581
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am deeply ambivalent about all of </v>

1257
01:14:17.581 --> 01:14:17.581
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1258
01:14:17.581 --> 01:14:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

1259
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.310
<v Speaker 1>very hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1260
01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:22.610
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1261
01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:27.980
<v Speaker 1>a good word about the personality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>

1262
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1263
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a reason that I,</v>

1264
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I found it impossible to support him in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>

1265
01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I think one has to acknowledge that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a used inflammatory language,</v>

1266
01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the issues are,</v>

1267
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:50.140
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1268
01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.630
<v Speaker 1>that he has a record of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1269
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.770
<v Speaker 1>of lying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

1270
01:14:57.250 --> 01:15:00.520
<v Speaker 1>even by the standards of American </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents.</v>

1271
01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Pretty remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1272
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:09.030
<v Speaker 1>and so the familiar list of things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump that most of my friends </v>

1273
01:15:11.081 --> 01:15:13.200
<v Speaker 1>find objectionable is kind of hard for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me to,</v>

1274
01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:17.050
<v Speaker 1>to dismiss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I said I'm bivalent for a reason.</v>

1275
01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:22.030
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

1276
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:27.990
<v Speaker 1>what if he lost?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said this to Sam Harris a few weeks </v>

1277
01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.890
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's run the counterfactual.</v>

1278
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's just what historians should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's imagine an alternative history.</v>

1279
01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:36.280
<v Speaker 1>If Donald trump had lost the election by</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1280
01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:38.530
<v Speaker 1>the same narrow margin that he wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1281
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:44.130
<v Speaker 1>how would all those people who voted for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him have felt,</v>

1282
01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:47.260
<v Speaker 1>and how would they have behaved to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind?</v>

1283
01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:52.260
<v Speaker 1>The election of Donald trump is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cathartic moment for those people.</v>

1284
01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:57.480
<v Speaker 1>So despised by the liberal elites that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could refer to them as deplorables.</v>

1285
01:15:58.870 --> 01:16:03.870
<v Speaker 1>The people who voted for Donald trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not by and large are racists,</v>

1286
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.230
<v Speaker 1>are not by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1287
01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:13.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like Donald Trump is </v>

1288
01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:16.171
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What attracted them to trump were two </v>

1289
01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:20.581
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which as with the brexit campaign will </v>

1290
01:16:20.581 --> 01:16:20.860
<v Speaker 1>legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

1291
01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:25.000
<v Speaker 1>they were attracted to trump's policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions on trade,</v>

1292
01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.810
<v Speaker 1>on immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Islam,</v>

1293
01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:34.400
<v Speaker 1>at and on our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the somewhat a corrupt liberal elite </v>

1294
01:16:34.871 --> 01:16:37.990
<v Speaker 1>that had been running the country for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the previous eight years,</v>

1295
01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.630
<v Speaker 1>so I think they were attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's policy positions,</v>

1296
01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:44.950
<v Speaker 1>but they were also attracted to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural position and I think about half</v>

1297
01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:49.951
<v Speaker 1>of American populism is cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What attracted the friends I have who </v>

1298
01:16:50.531 --> 01:16:55.210
<v Speaker 1>supported trump to trump was his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental shift in language,</v>

1299
01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:59.470
<v Speaker 1>away from the politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking points of the political class,</v>

1300
01:16:59.471 --> 01:17:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Republicans and Democrats alike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a demotic normal way of speaking,</v>

1301
01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:07.180
<v Speaker 1>such as you would here in the typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>American bar,</v>

1302
01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:10.310
<v Speaker 1>more or less anywhere in the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>except Massachusetts,</v>

1303
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

1304
01:17:11.571 --> 01:17:12.200
<v Speaker 1>and the rest.</v>

1305
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1306
01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking on the eve of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

1307
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:22.570
<v Speaker 1>if you line up all the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to vote for her and you line up </v>

1308
01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:22.570
<v Speaker 1>all the people who are going to vote for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1309
01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:24.710
<v Speaker 1>which line would you rather be in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember at that point,</v>

1310
01:17:24.711 --> 01:17:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1311
01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:30.110
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>

1312
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm with the people who are so pissed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the political establishment that </v>

1313
01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:41.520
<v Speaker 1>they're ready to take a chance on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy because they see no other way to </v>

1314
01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:46.301
<v Speaker 1>shake things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way my friend Jerry Blake put it to </v>

1315
01:17:46.301 --> 01:17:46.820
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ex marine corps,</v>

1316
01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Xn ypd never went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps take care of my wife.</v>

1317
01:17:52.891 --> 01:17:57.891
<v Speaker 1>Security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry said to me early 2016 two things </v>

1318
01:17:57.891 --> 01:17:59.090
<v Speaker 1>that stuck in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First he told me trump was gonna win,</v>

1319
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.440
<v Speaker 1>but then he said the two reasons why he </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported trump.</v>

1320
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Number One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tells it like it is.</v>

1321
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to shake things up by.</v>

1322
01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:14.801
<v Speaker 1>He tells it like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared did not mean he is always </v>

1323
01:18:14.801 --> 01:18:18.011
<v Speaker 1>truthful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he meant was he talks like me by </v>

1324
01:18:18.011 --> 01:18:22.331
<v Speaker 1>shaking things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry meant we have to do something </v>

1325
01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:23.510
<v Speaker 1>because this system as it stands is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my interests.</v>

1326
01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:29.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not in my interests economically </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems to favor China over the</v>

1327
01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:34.420
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans over a native born Americans </v>

1328
01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:36.980
<v Speaker 1>the rich one percent over me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the median household,</v>

1329
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:42.370
<v Speaker 1>but he's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also about this cultural reaction </v>

1330
01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:46.691
<v Speaker 1>against the multiculturalism that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the orthodoxy of the liberal </v>

1331
01:18:46.691 --> 01:18:49.670
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for all my reservations about trump,</v>

1332
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:52.970
<v Speaker 1>I completely got why people voted for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1333
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:58.270
<v Speaker 1>And I think their reaction had he lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have been toxic.</v>

1334
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they would have accepted </v>
<v Speaker 1>the legitimacy of the result.</v>

1335
01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I think they would have bought the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

1336
01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:06.920
<v Speaker 1>trump would have told them that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>election being rigged,</v>

1337
01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.820
<v Speaker 1>and I think we would have had a poisoned</v>
<v Speaker 1>body politic from day one of the Clinton</v>

1338
01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:13.310
<v Speaker 1>presidency if it all ends.</v>

1339
01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Oddly though we're having that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1340
01:19:14.841 --> 01:19:16.040
<v Speaker 1>just in the reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1341
01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:21.100
<v Speaker 1>It would have been worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're having a left that's not </v>

1342
01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:21.100
<v Speaker 1>accepting the legitimacy of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>

1343
01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think it would have been worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1344
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it would have been worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1345
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.760
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is another part of the story </v>

1346
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:37.850
<v Speaker 1>that for Jerry and his and his many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many fellow Americans who voted trump,</v>

1347
01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 1>this has always been a gamble and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've always had a sense that it could</v>

1348
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:43.280
<v Speaker 1>go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1349
01:19:43.281 --> 01:19:45.440
<v Speaker 1>when you shake things up sometimes they </v>
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>

1350
01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.180
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sense that if it all ends in fiasco,</v>

1351
01:19:50.181 --> 01:19:54.020
<v Speaker 1>which I guess that the vast majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>public intellectuals expect,</v>

1352
01:19:54.021 --> 01:19:56.720
<v Speaker 1>and some combination of Watergate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other scandals,</v>

1353
01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I think Jerry and his and his fellow </v>
<v Speaker 1>American trump supporters will say,</v>

1354
01:20:00.831 --> 01:20:01.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gave it a try.</v>

1355
01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Give it a try.</v>

1356
01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.000
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

1357
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:10.030
<v Speaker 1>that's one possible scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other reason that I am ambivalent </v>

1358
01:20:10.111 --> 01:20:15.111
<v Speaker 1>about trump is that for all his flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways he's doing a better job on </v>

1359
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:20.310
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy than his predecessor did </v>
<v Speaker 1>a because trump has this superpower that</v>

1360
01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:25.340
<v Speaker 1>most intellectuals can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has an unerring instinct for the </v>

1361
01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:28.770
<v Speaker 1>weakness of the counterparty that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of almost animal instinct.</v>

1362
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:31.980
<v Speaker 1>But some are Donald Trump can tell when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side is weak.</v>

1363
01:20:32.190 --> 01:20:34.380
<v Speaker 1>You could see it in Jeb Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see it in Marco.</v>

1364
01:20:34.381 --> 01:20:39.381
<v Speaker 1>Rubio could see it in Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I think he sees it in the </v>

1365
01:20:39.381 --> 01:20:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Europeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sees in Angola Merkel,</v>

1366
01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:44.130
<v Speaker 1>you don't pay enough for your defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I walk out on NATO?</v>

1367
01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1368
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:49.650
<v Speaker 1>the season Kim Jong UN and he sees it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xi Jinping.</v>

1369
01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:51.540
<v Speaker 1>He sees it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1370
01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:53.130
<v Speaker 1>in the supreme leader in Neuron.</v>

1371
01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:58.200
<v Speaker 1>So my ambivalence is partly my sympathy </v>
<v Speaker 1>for trump supporters,</v>

1372
01:20:58.210 --> 01:21:02.670
<v Speaker 1>my fundamental sense of why they voted </v>
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>

1373
01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:08.180
<v Speaker 1>But it's also that in some ways this </v>
<v Speaker 1>disruption has its plus side in the way </v>

1374
01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.960
<v Speaker 1>that it's repositioning the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

1375
01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1376
01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:15.650
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's given oxygen to everything that </v>

1377
01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:15.650
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't,</v>

1378
01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:19.710
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't discount all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate concerns that you look.</v>

1379
01:21:19.711 --> 01:21:22.140
<v Speaker 1>The big concern for me as I mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1380
01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:23.850
<v Speaker 1>is that the pendulum swings the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1381
01:21:23.851 --> 01:21:28.170
<v Speaker 1>If this all ends in tears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those who defended it,</v>

1382
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 1>even if they defended it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>halfhearted delight me,</v>

1383
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:35.220
<v Speaker 1>will be discredited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the damage will be irreparable,</v>

1384
01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:38.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for conservatives and populists alike.</v>

1385
01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:44.930
<v Speaker 1>The left we empowered and they will </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend the rest of our lives telling us </v>

1386
01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:47.910
<v Speaker 1>that we were apologists for the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

1387
01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a scenario that you can </v>

1388
01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:55.230
<v Speaker 1>discount likely for a time.</v>

1389
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:59.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it was exhilarating are freely </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that for me,</v>

1390
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:05.540
<v Speaker 1>one of the most satisfying aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's victory was that all the people </v>

1391
01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:09.171
<v Speaker 1>I most dislike in this contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in a state of shock for weeks and </v>

1392
01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I remember things that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1393
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.490
<v Speaker 1>it can't be all bad if the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really can't stand her in this state,</v>

1394
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:21.090
<v Speaker 1>but you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with history and mind,</v>

1395
01:22:21.091 --> 01:22:26.091
<v Speaker 1>be conscious of the dangers of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this could end so badly that it </v>

1396
01:22:26.091 --> 01:22:30.621
<v Speaker 1>does irreparable damage and and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst damage of all will be if it </v>

1397
01:22:30.621 --> 01:22:34.110
<v Speaker 1>propels the left of the Democratic Party</v>
<v Speaker 1>into power and that,</v>

1398
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:36.510
<v Speaker 1>that you can't reload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't really do that.</v>

1399
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:41.750
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing about studying history </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it makes you aware of under </v>

1400
01:22:42.181 --> 01:22:47.181
<v Speaker 1>terministic that historical processes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is always more than one </v>

1401
01:22:47.181 --> 01:22:50.751
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the future of trial as the </v>

1402
01:22:50.751 --> 01:22:50.910
<v Speaker 1>future of tragedy and there's this kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of other future in the middle,</v>

1403
01:22:50.911 --> 01:22:55.911
<v Speaker 1>which is a little bit of both and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really one of the historical moment is </v>

1404
01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:01.520
<v Speaker 1>bad for restful sleep on wakes up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and I'm sure you have the same </v>

1405
01:23:02.461 --> 01:23:07.461
<v Speaker 1>feeling wondering what alert will be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone and what message will be on </v>

1406
01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:10.270
<v Speaker 1>your phone.</v>

1407
01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Will the alert say was broken out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will the alert say a palace coup and </v>

1408
01:23:19.601 --> 01:23:21.700
<v Speaker 1>will the message say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1409
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:27.030
<v Speaker 1>your reputation has just been a been </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed by some accusation or other.</v>

1410
01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:33.960
<v Speaker 1>So one wakes up in a state of anxiety in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States of 2018.</v>

1411
01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:39.330
<v Speaker 1>And that is a reality for that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>is inherent in both the culture war that</v>

1412
01:23:40.451 --> 01:23:43.060
<v Speaker 1>we've spoken about and the trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidency,</v>

1413
01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:45.820
<v Speaker 1>which is in some measure a backlash </v>
<v Speaker 1>against that.</v>

1414
01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:46.900
<v Speaker 1>That culture war.</v>

1415
01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:53.740
<v Speaker 2>We're going to leave it at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am going to demand that you come </v>

1416
01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:54.560
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever demanded that.</v>

1417
01:23:54.561 --> 01:23:55.850
<v Speaker 2>I guess come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been asked,</v>

1418
01:23:56.060 --> 01:24:01.060
<v Speaker 2>but I'm legitimately demanding that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>come back because next time I want to </v>

1419
01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.530
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to just do all history and,</v>

1420
01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:07.620
<v Speaker 2>and even even barely jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them to meet with the British </v>

1421
01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.830
<v Speaker 2>empire stuff and Churchill and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1422
01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:13.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm demanding it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you accept my demand except.</v>

1423
01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.990
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took a long time to get you here but,</v>

1424
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:20.040
<v Speaker 2>but considering we're both two guys just</v>
<v Speaker 2>off planes today and you're a,</v>

1425
01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you're like 87 hours out of whack and </v>
<v Speaker 2>jet lag and all the things we said will </v>

1426
01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.340
<v Speaker 2>be taken out of context on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1427
01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:31.000
<v Speaker 2>I sincerely hope everything because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you know,</v>

1428
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:33.470
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has truly,</v>

1429
01:24:33.471 --> 01:24:38.471
<v Speaker 2>truly been an absolute pleasure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you for doing this and send my </v>

1430
01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:38.471
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1431
01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Diane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure will.</v>

1432
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:40.410
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for more Neil,</v>

1433
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:45.430
<v Speaker 2>you can follow him on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you don't fight with people </v>

1434
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.430
<v Speaker 2>that much on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means,</v>

1435
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:46.520
<v Speaker 2>which means you have strong moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

1436
01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.420
<v Speaker 2>I decided the jungle warfare was not the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to go.</v>

1437
01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:56.560
<v Speaker 2>He's a wise man and it's at an F E R G U</v>
<v Speaker 2>S.</v>
