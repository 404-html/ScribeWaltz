1
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.743
<v Speaker 1>Naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to start this week by talking </v>

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:07.320
<v Speaker 1>about the horrific attacks in Paris a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few days ago.</v>

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.423
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that these attacks are </v>

4
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:10.344
<v Speaker 1>becoming all too common these days and </v>
<v Speaker 1>each event continues in the path of </v>

5
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:18.771
<v Speaker 1>carnage and absolute savagery these </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic extremists want to impose on the</v>

6
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Western world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:20.994
<v Speaker 1>I did say Islamic extremist there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that upset some and makes the </v>

8
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>politically correct crowd uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately the more we ignore the</v>

9
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>very set of ideas these people tell us </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're using to attack us,</v>

10
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:33.414
<v Speaker 1>the more we actually strengthened them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what my former guests </v>

11
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>marginalized told me he refers to as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>voldemort effect.</v>

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Jk Rowling described this idea in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter books as quote,</v>

13
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>fear of a name only increases fear of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing itself.</v>

14
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Are there any other ideas we should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of talking about?</v>

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of any and I refuse to </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat this one idea differently.</v>

16
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.513
<v Speaker 1>We can't be afraid of scary things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in idea form because that's </v>

17
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:01.494
<v Speaker 1>how they will grow and morph right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of our eyes and of course by </v>

18
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>saying these people who committed these </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific horrific acts,</v>

19
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.073
<v Speaker 1>whereas alarmist extremist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it obviously doesn't condemn all </v>

20
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If at this point you can understand that</v>

21
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:16.824
<v Speaker 1>distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps there's a cat video out there </v>

22
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>better suited for you than what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing here.</v>

23
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>I've mentioned a couple of weeks ago how</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to move a bit away from talking</v>

24
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>about the regressive left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I still want to do that.</v>

25
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the regressives are a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the mafia.</v>

26
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>The more I try to get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more they pull me back.</v>

27
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>In.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Case in point,</v>

28
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.683
<v Speaker 1>the response by many of the regressives </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately after the attacks was to </v>

29
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>blame us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foreign policy rationalizing,</v>

30
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:40.254
<v Speaker 1>we ourselves are to blame for the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who chose to murder over 100 innocent </v>

31
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:45.234
<v Speaker 1>civilians.</v>

32
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>After talking to my last two guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Murray and Feisal site,</v>

33
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.683
<v Speaker 1>all Matar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've come to believe this is an </v>

34
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:51.954
<v Speaker 1>incredibly dangerous and egotistical </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead driven view of the world to the </v>

35
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>regressives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything revolves around us.</v>

36
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>People only do things as a reaction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

37
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.023
<v Speaker 1>so even though these terrorists say </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing this in the name of </v>

38
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:05.964
<v Speaker 1>religion and point to the actual texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they approve it well according to the </v>

39
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:10.014
<v Speaker 1>regressives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't know what they're </v>

40
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>

41
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.403
<v Speaker 1>as mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as I've been saying repeatedly to </v>

42
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:20.970
<v Speaker 1>things can be true at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be true that there is an ideology</v>

43
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:21.804
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book written by men a long time ago </v>

44
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>that gives plenty of reasons to kill all</v>
<v Speaker 1>infidels,</v>

45
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.853
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time it can be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our western foreign policy created </v>

46
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.114
<v Speaker 1>massive instability in their part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and perhaps if we left it on the </v>

47
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isis never would have arose.</v>

48
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Every action leads to consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often unintended ones.</v>

49
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes America does good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes America does bad things,</v>

50
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.053
<v Speaker 1>but thinking it's all about us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the time seems more like how a </v>

51
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>child would think of the world than how </v>
<v Speaker 1>an adult would approach the problem.</v>

52
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.813
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this will stop the regressives </v>

53
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>from laying blame solely on America and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's allies thus emboldening,</v>

54
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>both the extremists themselves and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the far right.</v>

55
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.303
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to have discussions on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this show so people can see that there </v>

56
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:09.574
<v Speaker 1>are others out there who understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuance and complexity of these very </v>

57
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>difficult issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have all the answers,</v>

58
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:16.744
<v Speaker 1>but we aren't afraid to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations that most people won't </v>

59
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.014
<v Speaker 1>touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's pretend for a second that all of </v>

60
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:22.774
<v Speaker 1>the world's issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a hundred percent because of </v>

61
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>America and we did exactly whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is isis would want us to do.</v>

62
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Would that make us any safer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

63
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.194
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure we do the exact opposite</v>
<v Speaker 1>by holding the Western world in a </v>

64
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:35.914
<v Speaker 1>perpetual hostage crisis with the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have an old text to justify </v>

65
00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:40.904
<v Speaker 1>adjust to that final thought on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not trying to score cheap </v>

66
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>political points here by constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling out the regressive.</v>

67
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.283
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to lay out a case to show you</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that the left is in real danger </v>

68
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>because of the regressives misguided </v>
<v Speaker 1>head in the sand,</v>

69
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>politically correct brand of </v>
<v Speaker 1>demagoguery.</v>

70
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.843
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blame these attacks on nobody other </v>

71
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:00.754
<v Speaker 1>than the sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted people who committed these </v>

72
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>horrific acts of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

73
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:06.484
<v Speaker 1>I won't stop speaking up against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>misguided ideas that will only bring </v>

74
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:11.044
<v Speaker 1>about more of these acts because we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to look at the whole picture and </v>

75
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>not just our narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>myopic view of the world.</v>

76
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.973
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is Sarah Haider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah is the cofounder of ex Muslims of </v>

77
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:22.234
<v Speaker 1>North America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an organization which advocates for the </v>

78
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:25.714
<v Speaker 1>acceptance of religious dissent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promote secular values and aims to </v>

79
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>reduce discrimination of those who leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

80
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to her twitter bio,</v>

81
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>she is Pakistani by birth and American </v>
<v Speaker 1>by choice.</v>

82
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the show.</v>

83
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me here today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good to be here,</v>

84
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.693
<v Speaker 1>so I'm so glad we finally connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've been going back and forth </v>

85
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of months and we seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta swimming in the same circles,</v>

86
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 1>so to speak lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love that line.</v>

87
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's just start with that line on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter bio,</v>

88
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Pakistani by birth and American by </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

89
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Why did you put that in there?</v>

90
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

91
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.653
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of people don't know about me </v>

92
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:04.770
<v Speaker 2>is that I am an immigrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

93
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's a big part of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

94
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.583
<v Speaker 2>And in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the American by choice </v>

95
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 2>means a lot because there are so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>things about America that I love.</v>

96
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.510
<v Speaker 2>There are so many values that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

97
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 2>that are truly American that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

98
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 2>are wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in so many left wing circles,</v>

99
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:25.930
<v Speaker 2>it's unfashionable to say anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive about America at all.</v>

100
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.590
<v Speaker 2>And I hope to be able to swim against </v>
<v Speaker 2>that tide a little bit.</v>

101
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that as an immigrant </v>

102
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>that's doing good things in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

103
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to maybe kind of say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something nice about America.</v>

104
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Are you a neo con now?</v>

105
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.010
<v Speaker 2>It was apparently if you ask certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>people I am,</v>

106
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.750
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

107
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me so long to be able to get </v>

108
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:47.834
<v Speaker 2>this citizenship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only got it this year and now I am </v>

109
00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:54.290
<v Speaker 2>fully an American citizen and I feel so </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy about it because this is a country</v>

110
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I know so much about and I've spent my </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire,</v>

111
00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:57.524
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of my life here and I feel so </v>

112
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:01.034
<v Speaker 2>strongly that I am part of the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>fabric and I want to contribute to it </v>

113
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 2>however I can.</v>

114
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously I love all that.</v>

115
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:07.214
<v Speaker 1>And where I really became familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you was back in May when you gave this </v>

116
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 1>speech at the American Humanist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Association,</v>

117
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.413
<v Speaker 1>which was really brilliant stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I want to start first with a little </v>

118
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:17.414
<v Speaker 1>bit of your history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you and your family come here </v>

119
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.353
<v Speaker 1>from Pakistan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you sort of have your secular </v>

120
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>awakening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing?</v>

121
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

122
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I think I was about eight years old when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came to America and I remember,</v>

123
00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:32.760
<v Speaker 2>I remember this being a very strange and</v>
<v Speaker 2>new country for me.</v>

124
00:06:32.761 --> 00:06:35.910
<v Speaker 2>I remember learning the language and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking it was very strange.</v>

125
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

126
00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:40.590
<v Speaker 2>I struggled a little bit in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>few years,</v>

127
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.723
<v Speaker 2>but then there was so much about America</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I thought was just wonderful and I </v>

128
00:06:45.241 --> 00:06:48.060
<v Speaker 2>mean these concepts that we have that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>take for granted,</v>

129
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.320
<v Speaker 2>individual liberty and right to free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech and all these things.</v>

131
00:06:52.321 --> 00:06:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these don't exist in any form in so many</v>

132
00:06:55.591 --> 00:06:57.810
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as that we have it,</v>

133
00:06:57.811 --> 00:07:00.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw this with new eyes and hey,</v>

134
00:07:00.331 --> 00:07:01.164
<v Speaker 2>here you can say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not anything truly but in a way </v>

135
00:07:04.711 --> 00:07:07.590
<v Speaker 2>that in a way that isn't just comparable</v>
<v Speaker 2>to anywhere else.</v>

136
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.990
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

137
00:07:09.991 --> 00:07:10.824
<v Speaker 2>I became really immersed into American </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and I thought it was really </v>

138
00:07:13.921 --> 00:07:15.670
<v Speaker 2>wonderful the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

139
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.300
<v Speaker 2>the separation of powers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bill of rights.</v>

140
00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:23.301
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was just fantastic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I was about 16,</v>

141
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.020
<v Speaker 2>15 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

142
00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:25.854
<v Speaker 2>I began to have doubts about my faith </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of it had to do with actually </v>

143
00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:31.350
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

144
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.090
<v Speaker 2>just debating and seeing new viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on the debate team that helped,</v>

145
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did push me a little bit,</v>

146
00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I think was meeting a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you would call a militant atheists,</v>

147
00:07:44.101 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the obnoxious,</v>

148
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.890
<v Speaker 1>the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those militant atheist violence,</v>

149
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people that get in your face.</v>

150
00:07:52.841 --> 00:07:54.580
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was one guy in particular,</v>

151
00:07:54.581 --> 00:07:55.414
<v Speaker 2>I know a few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was one guy in particular who </v>

152
00:07:57.341 --> 00:08:00.280
<v Speaker 2>would print out verses from the Koran </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were just horrible,</v>

153
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These horrible verses.</v>

154
00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:04.300
<v Speaker 2>And he would just hand them to me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not say a word and just be like,</v>

155
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:05.260
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

156
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.530
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was my first time really,</v>

157
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.920
<v Speaker 2>really looking into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is the case for so many</v>

158
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Christians and Jews and Muslims who </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave religion that they were like,</v>

159
00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:16.151
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:19.120
<v Speaker 2>when I really looked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't make a lot of sense.</v>

161
00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Or there were some horrible stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

162
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:26.170
<v Speaker 2>and for me it was kind of a quest to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prove these atheist wrong,</v>

163
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

164
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I started doing research online because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sure that,</v>

165
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:37.410
<v Speaker 2>that Islam was the way and as long was </v>
<v Speaker 2>so good for women and women's rights and</v>

166
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.050
<v Speaker 2>all of this stuff could be explained </v>
<v Speaker 2>when looked into context.</v>

167
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:43.480
<v Speaker 2>And then I looked at the context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I made things worse.</v>

168
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.640
<v Speaker 2>So then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

169
00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:49.360
<v Speaker 2>well it's time to admit defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it didn't really take me a long time</v>

170
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.283
<v Speaker 2>before I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this just doesn't make any sense and </v>

171
00:08:51.911 --> 00:08:55.020
<v Speaker 2>it's not honest for me to say that I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Muslim.</v>

172
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Given that I know all of this now.</v>

173
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that you described the militant </v>

174
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.990
<v Speaker 1>atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they have?</v>

175
00:08:59.991 --> 00:09:03.440
<v Speaker 1>They had photocopied paper that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was their weapon.</v>

176
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.380
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other extremists,</v>

177
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.130
<v Speaker 1>they have some more serious stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

178
00:09:07.131 --> 00:09:09.110
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a paper cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much going to be the worst</v>

179
00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:09.980
<v Speaker 1>thing that's going to happen to you.</v>

180
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>

181
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.010
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me that's all I had.</v>

182
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.280
<v Speaker 2>That's all that it took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really is just here,</v>

183
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 2>this was what you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the book,</v>

184
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 2>this is your holy book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this all the drug.</v>

185
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

186
00:09:19.671 --> 00:09:24.200
<v Speaker 1>when they showed you that and you looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this was your family,</v>

187
00:09:24.201 --> 00:09:28.130
<v Speaker 1>like how religious was your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did your process of coming out,</v>

188
00:09:28.131 --> 00:09:28.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've described this process that </v>

189
00:09:30.411 --> 00:09:34.640
<v Speaker 1>atheists have to come out of the closet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like lgbt people do,</v>

190
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:35.474
<v Speaker 1>that there is this hidden shame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this feeling of the otherness and all </v>

191
00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:38.984
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long did that take before you had </v>

192
00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:42.560
<v Speaker 1>the realization versus when you told </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

193
00:09:42.561 --> 00:09:43.520
<v Speaker 1>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing?</v>

194
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as far as that terminology,</v>

195
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 2>that coming out thing that's so common </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Muslim circles,</v>

196
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.193
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we used was that have you </v>

197
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 2>come out to your like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

198
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you out of the closet?</v>

199
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:57.380
<v Speaker 2>That is the language that we use because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>

200
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.920
<v Speaker 2>That's the reality of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

201
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

202
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.943
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I did was I drew just have debates </v>

203
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 2>with my family here and there about </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific issues and that's how they sort</v>

204
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:09.900
<v Speaker 2>of got the message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I explicitly said it for</v>

205
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.690
<v Speaker 2>the first couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

206
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.743
<v Speaker 2>but I was lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very lucky in that I have a truly </v>

207
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 2>liberal father and by liberal I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

208
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I still wasn't allowed to wear certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of clothing.</v>

209
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:22.134
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still couldn't wear shorts in the </v>

210
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:23.724
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still couldn't have boyfriends or </v>

211
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:26.934
<v Speaker 2>anything like that or date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was expected to get an arranged </v>

212
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:30.340
<v Speaker 2>marriage and everything.</v>

213
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the liberal part coming?</v>

214
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 1>It's coming,</v>

215
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's liberal.</v>

216
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 2>It's liberal in the sense that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed me to.</v>

217
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 2>My father allowed me to read what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to read and he didn't question it</v>

218
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 2>too much because he thought I would end </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the right place at the end.</v>

219
00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:43.734
<v Speaker 2>So that was a sense of freedom and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>only had to fight for maybe a year or </v>

220
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:50.640
<v Speaker 2>two to be able to go away for college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>

221
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:51.780
<v Speaker 2>that was my liberal father.</v>

222
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So funny how it's so funny how terms and</v>

223
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 1>words really mean a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:59.370
<v Speaker 1>before you refer to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you say something nice about America,</v>

225
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>the left will say you're a neocon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in,</v>

226
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 1>and in this context you described your </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal father,</v>

227
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.223
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't wear shorts and that kind </v>

228
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet clearly within that space he was</v>

229
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

230
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.180
<v Speaker 2>It was very liberal and he was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal in the sense that he,</v>

231
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.163
<v Speaker 2>he gave me a sort of dignity as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a woman that I think that wasn't </v>

232
00:11:20.081 --> 00:11:20.914
<v Speaker 2>given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't given by many Muslim men to </v>

233
00:11:22.781 --> 00:11:25.180
<v Speaker 2>their daughters and to their wives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mothers.</v>

234
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.060
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I consider myself lucky.</v>

235
00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that sounds interesting,</v>

236
00:11:29.531 --> 00:11:32.260
<v Speaker 2>but I do consider myself very lucky that</v>
<v Speaker 2>my childhood was,</v>

237
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.483
<v Speaker 2>it was similar to maybe what very </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative almost fundamentalist </v>

238
00:11:37.121 --> 00:11:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Christians would have and that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider myself lucky that I didn't,</v>

239
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't forced to wear the hijab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did wear it for a short amount of time</v>

240
00:11:43.541 --> 00:11:44.510
<v Speaker 2>by choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

241
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.500
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't forced upon me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

242
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.083
<v Speaker 2>so it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is interesting what we consider </v>

243
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 2>liberal and what's considered liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else in the.</v>

244
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the interesting things</v>

245
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 1>and one of the reasons why I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you because you know,</v>

246
00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 1>there are so many stories you hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

247
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x Christians leaving,</v>

248
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 1>you hear about ecs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews leaving,</v>

249
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:05.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox Judaism,</v>

250
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 1>something like that were there then </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered heroes on the left.</v>

251
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 1>They left this dogmatic conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>

252
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.073
<v Speaker 1>but you don't hear about many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you and I've recently connected </v>

253
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:17.494
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch and it's like you're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously standing up for the basic </v>

254
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 1>liberal values that we all talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

255
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

256
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.000
<v Speaker 2>it's so bizarre to be in this space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

257
00:12:29.001 --> 00:12:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I feel strange that I'm here because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like we have enemies,</v>

258
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.980
<v Speaker 2>like people who just don't like what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying for one reason or another.</v>

259
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.640
<v Speaker 2>And my narrative is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

260
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.553
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a classical liberal one and it's </v>

261
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.333
<v Speaker 2>something that on the face of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should it be something every liberal </v>

262
00:12:44.301 --> 00:12:46.280
<v Speaker 2>should support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is,</v>

263
00:12:46.281 --> 00:12:50.390
<v Speaker 2>there is such a tendency on the left to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect Muslims,</v>

264
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.393
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect them from bigotry and these </v>

265
00:12:52.281 --> 00:12:53.810
<v Speaker 2>fears of bigotry I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

266
00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:55.280
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're real right there.</v>

267
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

268
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.370
<v Speaker 2>they're not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

269
00:12:58.371 --> 00:13:00.520
<v Speaker 2>it is a fear and it's a real fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

270
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.620
<v Speaker 2>but the response has been what I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>call a reactionary.</v>

271
00:13:03.621 --> 00:13:05.360
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because they say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactionary,</v>

272
00:13:05.361 --> 00:13:06.194
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what would be your response </v>

273
00:13:07.431 --> 00:13:08.264
<v Speaker 2>to Islam is also very reactionary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're also not looking at it from an </v>

274
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.930
<v Speaker 2>objective point of view.</v>

275
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it seems to me we've got the </v>

276
00:13:13.401 --> 00:13:15.740
<v Speaker 1>reactionary right and the regressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

277
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.603
<v Speaker 1>But I want to hold that for a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to talk about the speech </v>

278
00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:19.783
<v Speaker 1>that you gave because it was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful and I saw a blowing up on </v>

279
00:13:21.981 --> 00:13:22.814
<v Speaker 1>twitter and a zillion people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>sending it to me and I watched it again </v>

280
00:13:24.801 --> 00:13:28.370
<v Speaker 1>yesterday in preparation for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

281
00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:30.230
<v Speaker 1>we talk about this coming out process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

282
00:13:30.231 --> 00:13:33.290
<v Speaker 1>you sort of referenced that in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to me like,</v>

283
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.110
<v Speaker 1>obviously without knowing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the first time we spoke,</v>

284
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:41.000
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed like your entire life had </v>
<v Speaker 1>led up to that very moment.</v>

285
00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Am I being very dramatic there?</v>

286
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I.</v>

287
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.240
<v Speaker 2>It was something that I was extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous doing it.</v>

288
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:48.951
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>

289
00:13:48.951 --> 00:13:49.784
<v Speaker 2>I think it showed in the video that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed that I was nervous and I was </v>

290
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.490
<v Speaker 2>because I felt um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever since I've been doing this activism</v>

291
00:13:55.491 --> 00:13:58.610
<v Speaker 2>now it's been three years that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing x Muslim activism.</v>

292
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.930
<v Speaker 2>I am blind sided by the reaction of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

293
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.310
<v Speaker 2>I really thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

294
00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:05.144
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that I hear from </v>
<v Speaker 2>activists everywhere I hear that they </v>

295
00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:10.430
<v Speaker 2>thought they would come here and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>will talk to people on the left and they</v>

296
00:14:10.431 --> 00:14:11.264
<v Speaker 2>would find allies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would find people who are willing to </v>

297
00:14:12.891 --> 00:14:13.724
<v Speaker 2>support them and we're willing to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least moral support if not anything </v>

298
00:14:16.461 --> 00:14:18.170
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they would find their brothers.</v>

299
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:19.303
<v Speaker 2>And I found it in so many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People I considered my brothers and my </v>

300
00:14:22.521 --> 00:14:24.710
<v Speaker 2>sisters in the struggle.</v>

301
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I have overlooked me for what seems like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very political,</v>

302
00:14:30.021 --> 00:14:33.240
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very political reason and the,</v>

303
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.030
<v Speaker 2>what I was feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

304
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.890
<v Speaker 2>especially around the time I was giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>that speech,</v>

305
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:42.260
<v Speaker 2>it was after the Charlie Hebdo shootings</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was feeling extremely disheartened</v>

306
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.423
<v Speaker 2>by the sec,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the secular community overall that </v>

307
00:14:45.921 --> 00:14:47.330
<v Speaker 2>there are so many people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

308
00:14:47.331 --> 00:14:47.871
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

309
00:14:47.871 --> 00:14:48.704
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in some ways it can be justified </v>

310
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.020
<v Speaker 2>and Islamophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia and all this stuff.</v>

311
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.033
<v Speaker 2>It didn't really make a lot of sense and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was feeling abandoned and so I </v>

312
00:14:58.131 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

313
00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:00.830
<v Speaker 2>they gave me this opportunity to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the speech,</v>

314
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:04.400
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to just speak my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe they expected me to talk a</v>

315
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 2>little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly about my organization,</v>

316
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:09.740
<v Speaker 2>but I ended up sort of hijacking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and talking about that.</v>

317
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

318
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:11.543
<v Speaker 1>first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I recommend that everyone that's </v>

319
00:15:12.631 --> 00:15:13.464
<v Speaker 1>watching this should absolutely watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because we can only touch on some </v>

320
00:15:16.471 --> 00:15:18.270
<v Speaker 1>of what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you did there,</v>

321
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.390
<v Speaker 1>but the reaction from the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

322
00:15:21.391 --> 00:15:23.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of what we've spent this show</v>

323
00:15:23.611 --> 00:15:27.030
<v Speaker 1>talking about and the more that I try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from it,</v>

324
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to address it so that I could</v>

325
00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:29.994
<v Speaker 1>move away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want these people to understand that </v>

326
00:15:32.521 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 1>someone like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone like me,</v>

327
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.170
<v Speaker 1>that we are standing up for liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>

328
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just that they've ignored </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in a lot of ways.</v>

329
00:15:40.021 --> 00:15:43.290
<v Speaker 1>These people have sort of actively tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>to undermined you,</v>

330
00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:44.124
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>

331
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there is.</v>

332
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not just undermining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its,</v>

333
00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 2>its sliming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

334
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 2>And there's people that have questioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>my agenda and what am I,</v>

335
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing this for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

336
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:54.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

337
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gaining anything from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in,</v>

338
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.713
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways this comes at a high </v>

339
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:02.060
<v Speaker 2>personal cost and I think many Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>that speak out.</v>

340
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are so many people that are,</v>

341
00:16:04.601 --> 00:16:05.434
<v Speaker 2>that are very intent on painting me as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing show and I get this all the </v>

342
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:09.764
<v Speaker 2>time and I even get this from people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought would be my allies from </v>

343
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 2>atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from leftists.</v>

344
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's</v>

345
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:17.723
<v Speaker 1>that tactic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that general tactic that it's not </v>

346
00:16:19.861 --> 00:16:20.694
<v Speaker 1>about what you say because if anyone was</v>
<v Speaker 1>to listen to that speech or hopefully </v>

347
00:16:24.391 --> 00:16:25.950
<v Speaker 1>anything that we're going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

348
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to guess that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>line up with liberal values 99 percent </v>

349
00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:32.430
<v Speaker 1>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's rarely about what you say.</v>

350
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It's about who you are and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fit into their neat little box of,</v>

351
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.900
<v Speaker 1>of what a Muslim should believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is crazy to me.</v>

352
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually disagree with it.</v>

353
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:43.603
<v Speaker 2>I think it is what you say in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you're talking negatively about </v>

354
00:16:46.861 --> 00:16:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Islam at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all,</v>

355
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.523
<v Speaker 2>on any perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is better if you're fueled by human </v>

356
00:16:51.871 --> 00:16:53.370
<v Speaker 2>rights are fueled by bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

357
00:16:53.371 --> 00:16:57.780
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if you are touching </v>
<v Speaker 2>negatively on Islam on any level,</v>

358
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.920
<v Speaker 2>you are a bigot matter how you say it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people say this to me.</v>

359
00:17:01.921 --> 00:17:02.760
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

360
00:17:02.761 --> 00:17:05.340
<v Speaker 2>what would you tell you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins,</v>

361
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

362
00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.173
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a way they can say their</v>
<v Speaker 2>critique a that would be beneficial and </v>

363
00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:15.120
<v Speaker 2>what I tell them is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or when I ask them instead is,</v>

364
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.283
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you think of somebody who has </v>

365
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.353
<v Speaker 2>directly a critique Islam and in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct way that has gotten away with it </v>

366
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.790
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't been called a bigot by some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

367
00:17:26.791 --> 00:17:27.690
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

368
00:17:27.691 --> 00:17:31.290
<v Speaker 2>what is the right way of saying this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point me to an example of somebody who's</v>

369
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.140
<v Speaker 2>critiquing Islam and it has been able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

370
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away and still retain their liberal </v>

371
00:17:36.841 --> 00:17:37.530
<v Speaker 2>credentials.</v>

372
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the part of this that drives </v>

373
00:17:39.451 --> 00:17:40.710
<v Speaker 1>me nuts because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.360
<v Speaker 1>when I started the show only a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago,</v>

375
00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:45.870
<v Speaker 1>my intention was not to talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff this much,</v>

376
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.913
<v Speaker 1>but as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get out of it because as a </v>

377
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:54.060
<v Speaker 1>liberal I see people like you and I say </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

378
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.000
<v Speaker 1>this is the very people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of your religion,</v>

379
00:17:57.001 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 1>if you were an ex Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

380
00:17:59.011 --> 00:17:59.844
<v Speaker 1>or if you were an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would feel the same way about the </v>

381
00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:04.140
<v Speaker 1>principles that you're standing up for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

382
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:04.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

383
00:18:04.521 --> 00:18:05.354
<v Speaker 1>I laid out some principles when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started the show that I wasn't going to </v>

384
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:11.190
<v Speaker 1>talk about people that much specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>people except in this space.</v>

385
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 1>There have been a couple people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

386
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:14.723
<v Speaker 1>have acted really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really dishonesty and I read just a </v>

387
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:18.354
<v Speaker 1>couple of days ago a piece that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote about some of the stuff that Reza </v>

388
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.493
<v Speaker 1>Aslan has said and I find him to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>profoundly dishonest player in this </v>

389
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:29.670
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see what he's done to Sam Harris.</v>

390
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Most of my audience knows about all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that already.</v>

391
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Can you explain a little bit about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

392
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.150
<v Speaker 1>what your stuff is with him?</v>

393
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this was,</v>

394
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in response to,</v>

395
00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I co wrote a piece with Muhammad,</v>

396
00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:44.820
<v Speaker 2>say who's also works with ex Muslims in </v>
<v Speaker 2>North America.</v>

397
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.961
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

398
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:49.830
<v Speaker 2>there a CNN clip that's been going </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and it's making rounds again.</v>

399
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.753
<v Speaker 2>I have the CNN clip where Reza Aslan is </v>
<v Speaker 2>on and he talks about fgm and he talks </v>

400
00:18:56.521 --> 00:19:01.450
<v Speaker 2>about Bill Maher and it talks about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>a fgm isn't an,</v>

401
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.880
<v Speaker 2>isn't a Muslim problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an African problem.</v>

402
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

403
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Female genital mutilation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should just say it for the few people</v>

404
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:09.020
<v Speaker 1>that may not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

405
00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he and he,</v>

406
00:19:10.331 --> 00:19:11.220
<v Speaker 2>and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

407
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.860
<v Speaker 2>he puts a few other things out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

408
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.280
<v Speaker 2>as evidence that I'm Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Majority countries are actually not that</v>

409
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.400
<v Speaker 2>bad for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

410
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.081
<v Speaker 2>including,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

411
00:19:19.081 --> 00:19:22.650
<v Speaker 2>there are some women that are heads of </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and et Cetera.</v>

412
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I wrote a piece about it.</v>

413
00:19:25.321 --> 00:19:26.154
<v Speaker 2>A Co wrote a piece about it and publish </v>
<v Speaker 2>it on the friendly atheist and it got </v>

414
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.270
<v Speaker 2>this big response because I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>there were some people that,</v>

415
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.203
<v Speaker 2>a good amount of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting somebody to pick up on these </v>

416
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:37.524
<v Speaker 2>things that they felt like weren't true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they couldn't say this and we said </v>

417
00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 2>it and we laid it out there and we laid </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out very clearly about why the points</v>

418
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:48.720
<v Speaker 2>that he was making were dishonest at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

419
00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the least.</v>

420
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:52.230
<v Speaker 2>And I think in a lot of ways he's aware </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what he's doing.</v>

421
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.020
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said many times that,</v>

422
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:56.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

423
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.263
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said something to the extent of how </v>

424
00:19:58.891 --> 00:19:59.724
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed freed the slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said things in that vein quite a few </v>

425
00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:06.150
<v Speaker 2>times and they're just extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>dishonest.</v>

426
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:08.130
<v Speaker 2>That is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not true.</v>

427
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.203
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all Mohammed did was say that you can't </v>

428
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:12.630
<v Speaker 2>enslave another Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are many people,</v>

429
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:13.464
<v Speaker 2>many scholars who think that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually encouraged the spread of the </v>

430
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:17.304
<v Speaker 2>slave trade because suddenly you're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia and you can't slave enslave </v>

431
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.933
<v Speaker 2>another Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to go out and you have </v>

432
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:23.483
<v Speaker 2>record on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to various places to get </v>

433
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:26.330
<v Speaker 2>your slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did that.</v>

434
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 2>He didn't condemn slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had slaves,</v>

435
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:33.501
<v Speaker 2>he had sex slaves and so there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And supposedly Reza Aslan is a scholar.</v>

436
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.513
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know about that whole </v>

437
00:20:34.871 --> 00:20:35.590
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

438
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I can't waste any more brain cells on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy basically.</v>

439
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so it's,</v>

440
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 2>it's very frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And talking about Reza,</v>

441
00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.373
<v Speaker 2>Aslan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting tired of it myself just to </v>

442
00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:44.101
<v Speaker 2>see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

443
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:46.160
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just make stuff up sometimes.</v>

444
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's part of the reason I</v>

445
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.813
<v Speaker 2>wanted to mention it because I knew you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were going to be exhausted by talking </v>

446
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:54.010
<v Speaker 2>about it because it's like you write </v>
<v Speaker 2>your piece and then you want to move on.</v>

447
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I felt a lot with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my interviews.</v>

448
00:20:56.351 --> 00:20:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed Sam and I wanted to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>on to some other stuff,</v>

449
00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:01.240
<v Speaker 2>but then these guys just further the </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>

450
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.313
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that that's part of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they throw out what I would call </v>

451
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.264
<v Speaker 2>just basic bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they throw out these lies in these </v>

452
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:10.204
<v Speaker 2>smears and then you have to spend a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of your time and your </v>

453
00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:19.270
<v Speaker 2>energy and your life force basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>either defending yourself or,</v>

454
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.090
<v Speaker 2>or the honest critiques that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>making.</v>

455
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is the experience of,</v>

456
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:25.873
<v Speaker 2>of almost everyone who has critique </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam in any way in which is why we're </v>

457
00:21:29.061 --> 00:21:31.370
<v Speaker 2>seeing that there's just a lack of it.</v>

458
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.203
<v Speaker 2>There's just a lack of it everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lack of scholarship if </v>

459
00:21:34.611 --> 00:21:36.620
<v Speaker 2>you try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to really study this.</v>

460
00:21:36.621 --> 00:21:37.650
<v Speaker 2>And I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

461
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:38.983
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't that much out there that is </v>

462
00:21:40.311 --> 00:21:41.144
<v Speaker 2>truly secular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is looking at it from a very </v>

463
00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.330
<v Speaker 2>outsider's perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

464
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:45.463
<v Speaker 2>there were some efforts to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've now been painted as </v>

465
00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.770
<v Speaker 2>orientalist and therefore bad and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore right wing of course.</v>

466
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's,</v>

467
00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.110
<v Speaker 2>that study sort of stopped around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time that those smears began.</v>

468
00:21:57.111 --> 00:21:57.944
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those associations with this </v>

469
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.373
<v Speaker 2>bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to conflate this with </v>

470
00:22:01.461 --> 00:22:03.920
<v Speaker 2>any kind of negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of negative anything.</v>

471
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

472
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.433
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really unfortunate because a </v>

473
00:22:08.151 --> 00:22:11.680
<v Speaker 2>scholarly pursuit of looking into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

474
00:22:11.681 --> 00:22:13.610
<v Speaker 2>what Islam is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did it begin,</v>

475
00:22:13.611 --> 00:22:15.410
<v Speaker 2>what Muhammad did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

476
00:22:15.411 --> 00:22:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has just,</v>

477
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:17.443
<v Speaker 2>it's suffered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's suffered tremendously because of </v>

478
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:23.480
<v Speaker 2>people's fears of being seen as a bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

479
00:22:23.481 --> 00:22:24.500
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of,</v>

480
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.230
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't really reached out,</v>

481
00:22:27.231 --> 00:22:29.210
<v Speaker 2>haven't really said the things that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to say,</v>

482
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.570
<v Speaker 2>reveal the knowledge that they had or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even looked into it further if they want</v>

483
00:22:32.571 --> 00:22:34.550
<v Speaker 2>it to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if they're thinking,</v>

484
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to destroy my career.</v>

485
00:22:36.381 --> 00:22:37.214
<v Speaker 2>What's the point?</v>

486
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doesn't some of that,</v>

487
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.710
<v Speaker 1>that fear of speaking out about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

488
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.130
<v Speaker 1>doesn't that actually show what real </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigotry is?</v>

489
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.053
<v Speaker 1>If you're afraid to speak out about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something because you think it's going </v>

490
00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 1>to lead to dishonest smearing of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or really what it's about is violence to</v>

491
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:54.094
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people clearly are really </v>

492
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:55.781
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

493
00:22:55.781 --> 00:22:56.614
<v Speaker 1>I get emails now every day literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>from all over the world that people are </v>

494
00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:00.604
<v Speaker 1>afraid to speak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the real bigotry is saying we're not </v>

495
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:05.830
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about these people because</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what,</v>

496
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:09.160
<v Speaker 1>they can't control their violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendencies or something like that.</v>

497
00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

498
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.970
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

499
00:23:10.971 --> 00:23:12.740
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>said this about,</v>

500
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.810
<v Speaker 2>about the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

501
00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:16.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should've seen it coming</v>

502
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.580
<v Speaker 1>that John Kerry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Kerry,</v>

503
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.940
<v Speaker 1>our secretary of state just in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>day or so,</v>

504
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.420
<v Speaker 1>said basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:24.940
<v Speaker 1>there was some sort of rationalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

506
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.540
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to say that,</v>

507
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.380
<v Speaker 2>that you have it coming when you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercising a right exercising or right.</v>

508
00:23:31.381 --> 00:23:33.180
<v Speaker 2>That is given to you in the country that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in.</v>

509
00:23:33.181 --> 00:23:36.480
<v Speaker 2>What's the point of having a right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can't test it to its extremes,</v>

510
00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:37.314
<v Speaker 2>that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a lot of ways what Charlie Hebdo </v>

511
00:23:39.571 --> 00:23:41.100
<v Speaker 2>did for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was not that extreme,</v>

512
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:41.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

513
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.533
<v Speaker 2>it was exactly the same treatment that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were giving Christianity and they </v>

514
00:23:44.671 --> 00:23:47.150
<v Speaker 2>were giving that exact same treatment </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

515
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.000
<v Speaker 2>to Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to me it seemed like they were,</v>

516
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.370
<v Speaker 2>they were making it fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were saying that,</v>

517
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:53.204
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not biased and we're gonna apply </v>

518
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:54.794
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same scrutiny to all religious </v>

519
00:23:57.831 --> 00:23:58.664
<v Speaker 2>forums,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they did that and I thought they </v>

520
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.230
<v Speaker 2>were very fair about it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>smeared in so many ways.</v>

521
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only did they do it out of a </v>

522
00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:08.690
<v Speaker 1>quality where they made fun of Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews and made fun of Christianity.</v>

523
00:24:08.691 --> 00:24:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to slightly butcher </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

524
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:11.744
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was something like 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent were about Christianity when </v>

525
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 1>they did cover is related to religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and only something like 10 percent we're</v>

526
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.050
<v Speaker 1>about Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

527
00:24:20.051 --> 00:24:21.680
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't quote me fully on that,</v>

528
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.020
<v Speaker 1>but also what people fail to realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Charlie Hebdo is that it was satire</v>

529
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 1>about the things that are wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

530
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:28.874
<v Speaker 1>They weren't mocking Muslims as people </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust as they weren't mocking </v>

531
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:33.164
<v Speaker 1>Christians as people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were mocking archaic age old </v>

532
00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

533
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.320
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

534
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:42.420
<v Speaker 2>And in many ways I think it can be seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>as an anti racist publication and,</v>

535
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.190
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people made a lot of good </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases for this.</v>

536
00:24:45.191 --> 00:24:46.024
<v Speaker 2>And it's difficult because we're English</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking people and we don't really </v>

537
00:24:48.431 --> 00:24:50.590
<v Speaker 2>understand the context of how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they,</v>

538
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.221
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

539
00:24:51.221 --> 00:24:53.770
<v Speaker 2>these publishers do what they do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>France.</v>

540
00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:58.300
<v Speaker 2>But I think when you look at it from an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a very unbiased perspective,</v>

541
00:24:58.301 --> 00:25:01.540
<v Speaker 2>you'll find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are anti racist in lot of ways and</v>

542
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.410
<v Speaker 2>it was horrible to hear people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they had it coming because it,</v>

543
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.393
<v Speaker 2>it made it seem not only that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid for doing what they're doing </v>

544
00:25:09.731 --> 00:25:11.470
<v Speaker 2>instead of brave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what they were,</v>

545
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.553
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also that Muslims are beasts and </v>

546
00:25:15.191 --> 00:25:16.024
<v Speaker 2>animals and we cannot expect them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave in the same way we would expect </v>

547
00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:20.830
<v Speaker 2>everyone else to behave.</v>

548
00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.693
<v Speaker 1>Right then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean about this sort of </v>

549
00:25:22.661 --> 00:25:23.494
<v Speaker 1>soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is what Bill Maher refers </v>

550
00:25:24.611 --> 00:25:26.770
<v Speaker 1>to as the soft bigotry of low </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations.</v>

551
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.650
<v Speaker 1>If you say anything about these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to upset them,</v>

552
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.753
<v Speaker 1>well then you have to just expect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to kill you and that </v>

553
00:25:32.121 --> 00:25:32.954
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you would live in a constant </v>

554
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.050
<v Speaker 1>hostage crisis with a certain set of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

555
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

556
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:40.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly the feeling of I think a </v>

557
00:25:41.621 --> 00:25:43.320
<v Speaker 2>lot of those people who tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

558
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid to speak out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it it,</v>

559
00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:45.813
<v Speaker 2>it is absolutely taking away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity and Muslims too because it's </v>

560
00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:52.450
<v Speaker 2>turning them into beasts that we cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We cannot say,</v>

561
00:25:52.451 --> 00:25:53.284
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a standard that we expect from </v>

562
00:25:54.311 --> 00:25:55.144
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We expect you to be able to handle this </v>

563
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.480
<v Speaker 2>and that they listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

564
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.860
<v Speaker 2>we actually haven't pushed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually haven't said that,</v>

565
00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:03.694
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is totally acceptable and this is </v>

566
00:26:05.381 --> 00:26:06.214
<v Speaker 2>totally what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we run things in the western world </v>

567
00:26:08.591 --> 00:26:09.424
<v Speaker 2>and this is what we expect out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone who is here in the Western </v>

568
00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:12.490
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We expect you to respect this,</v>

569
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:16.660
<v Speaker 2>especially not respond in a violent way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I haven't had that conversation.</v>

570
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.573
<v Speaker 1>So is part of it simply that for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are the real Islamic </v>

571
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.150
<v Speaker 1>extremist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they simply,</v>

572
00:26:24.151 --> 00:26:24.984
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much my friends on the </v>

573
00:26:26.761 --> 00:26:27.594
<v Speaker 1>left want to blame everything on </v>
<v Speaker 1>American foreign policy and all of this </v>

574
00:26:31.651 --> 00:26:32.461
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter,</v>

575
00:26:32.461 --> 00:26:33.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boko Haram killed about 160 people last </v>

576
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.353
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had nothing to do with American </v>

577
00:26:36.961 --> 00:26:38.070
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

578
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet this is,</v>

579
00:26:39.991 --> 00:26:42.150
<v Speaker 1>they always blame everything on America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't deny,</v>

580
00:26:42.151 --> 00:26:42.984
<v Speaker 1>as I said at the top of show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't deny that foreign policy is </v>

581
00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:46.314
<v Speaker 1>mocked up a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is where people on the left </v>

582
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:50.970
<v Speaker 1>just completely fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

583
00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

584
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:53.583
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of hearing that colonialism is </v>

585
00:26:56.061 --> 00:26:56.894
<v Speaker 2>to blame for all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of that one particular thing I </v>

586
00:26:59.151 --> 00:26:59.984
<v Speaker 2>hear all the time that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because of colonialism and it </v>

587
00:27:02.481 --> 00:27:04.880
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really make any sense when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look into it.</v>

588
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:05.930
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to say,</v>

589
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.150
<v Speaker 2>not to say that it colonialism wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>

590
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.043
<v Speaker 2>horrible practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm from the South Asian sub </v>

591
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:14.990
<v Speaker 2>continent so we were colonized by </v>
<v Speaker 2>England and it was horrible what England</v>

592
00:27:14.991 --> 00:27:17.810
<v Speaker 2>did to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to South Asia and the effects,</v>

593
00:27:17.811 --> 00:27:19.910
<v Speaker 2>the long range effects it had on South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asia,</v>

594
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.013
<v Speaker 2>but there are just so easy to throw away</v>
<v Speaker 2>the colonialism excuse when it comes to </v>

595
00:27:26.001 --> 00:27:27.260
<v Speaker 2>radical Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

596
00:27:27.261 --> 00:27:29.570
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned two of these in my speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>

597
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:30.643
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims have been doing this sort of </v>

598
00:27:32.091 --> 00:27:32.871
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>

599
00:27:32.871 --> 00:27:33.704
<v Speaker 2>justifying violence in the name of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion since way before colonialism </v>

600
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.510
<v Speaker 2>ever came into the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

601
00:27:38.511 --> 00:27:41.450
<v Speaker 2>That it's existed for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

602
00:27:41.451 --> 00:27:43.880
<v Speaker 2>And when you say colonialism was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only thing to blame,</v>

603
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.360
<v Speaker 2>you are denying that that whole history </v>
<v Speaker 2>existed.</v>

604
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.540
<v Speaker 2>But there were so many people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed in the name of Islam.</v>

605
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.730
<v Speaker 2>It's happened before and it's happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

606
00:27:52.731 --> 00:27:53.860
<v Speaker 2>It's the same sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

607
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.753
<v Speaker 1>Did you by any chance see a piece that </v>
<v Speaker 1>feisal site on the tire put up a couple </v>

608
00:27:57.971 --> 00:27:58.804
<v Speaker 1>of days ago on facebook where he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he writes sort of a satirical piece </v>

609
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.730
<v Speaker 1>saying that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's playing this,</v>

610
00:28:03.731 --> 00:28:07.120
<v Speaker 1>this Muslim extremists saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why I'm doing it.</v>

611
00:28:07.121 --> 00:28:07.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it for religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's basically this argument with </v>

612
00:28:10.181 --> 00:28:13.090
<v Speaker 1>him and one of these regressive left </v>
<v Speaker 1>these saying,</v>

613
00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:13.421
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

614
00:28:13.421 --> 00:28:13.781
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

615
00:28:13.781 --> 00:28:15.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not because of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he keeps saying,</v>

616
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:15.491
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

617
00:28:15.491 --> 00:28:17.050
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it because of religion.</v>

618
00:28:17.051 --> 00:28:17.884
<v Speaker 1>And they go back and forth and going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth and at the end of the </v>

619
00:28:19.991 --> 00:28:20.421
<v Speaker 1>guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:28:20.421 --> 00:28:23.980
<v Speaker 1>what do I have to do to prove to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is in the name of religion?</v>

621
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even after Paris,</v>

622
00:28:25.421 --> 00:28:26.800
<v Speaker 1>which I want to talk to you about in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

623
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.933
<v Speaker 1>the statement that these guys issued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of religious overtones </v>

624
00:28:31.301 --> 00:28:33.400
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ton of religious overtones.</v>

625
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.740
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't purely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

626
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.870
<v Speaker 1>this bombing in Syria or whatever.</v>

627
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

628
00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's astounding to me that at this point</v>

629
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.010
<v Speaker 2>anyone can deny that religion has </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with it.</v>

630
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that every,</v>

631
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.120
<v Speaker 2>that there was no one really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

632
00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:49.983
<v Speaker 2>any serious intellectual will believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this has nothing to do with </v>

633
00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has something you know,</v>

634
00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.860
<v Speaker 2>and you can even make the case that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a perverted Islam,</v>

635
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:57.783
<v Speaker 2>but it is some aspect of Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>theology that they have taken and then </v>

636
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:01.623
<v Speaker 2>perverted at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the very least that they have done </v>

637
00:29:03.881 --> 00:29:04.714
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that a lot of people play </v>

638
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.413
<v Speaker 2>just lip service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say that this has nothing to do </v>

639
00:29:08.981 --> 00:29:10.420
<v Speaker 2>with the religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they believe it.</v>

640
00:29:10.421 --> 00:29:13.540
<v Speaker 2>I think this is in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very political move.</v>

641
00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:14.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I mentioned this also at the top of </v>

642
00:29:15.731 --> 00:29:16.564
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if let's say magically the United </v>

643
00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.550
<v Speaker 1>States and the West and and France and </v>
<v Speaker 1>England and everybody,</v>

644
00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:25.630
<v Speaker 1>we all did whatever it is isis wants us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

645
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.060
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull out of that part of the world.</v>

646
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.193
<v Speaker 1>Whatever else they might want us to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any reason to believe that </v>

647
00:29:33.341 --> 00:29:36.820
<v Speaker 1>suddenly terror would stop or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things would get better?</v>

648
00:29:36.821 --> 00:29:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I actually would see it completely the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse.</v>

649
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:39.993
<v Speaker 1>They would own most be more to continue </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I say that as someone that doesn't </v>

650
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:44.640
<v Speaker 1>even want to be there in the first.</v>

651
00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

652
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>

653
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:50.560
<v Speaker 2>isis is a different animal and if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

654
00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 2>they are very strict about their </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation and they look into things</v>

655
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:55.144
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very literal way and if they are </v>

656
00:29:56.651 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 2>going to look into it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the way that,</v>

657
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic thought has progressed about </v>

658
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:06.380
<v Speaker 2>what you would call the land of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the believers in Atlanta,</v>

659
00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:09.010
<v Speaker 2>the nonbelievers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are religiously.</v>

660
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a duty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so religious duty to do what they can to</v>

661
00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:15.510
<v Speaker 2>spread Islam to at the whole globe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're not going to stop us there,</v>

662
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.413
<v Speaker 2>told us they're not going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we just listen to them and </v>

663
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 2>understand that they mean what they say?</v>

664
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the point of fizzles a </v>

665
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.440
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got into a fight on twitter.</v>

666
00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:27.274
<v Speaker 1>I try not to fight on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got into a fight with one of my </v>

667
00:30:29.381 --> 00:30:31.570
<v Speaker 1>friends on the left who kept saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy.</v>

668
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.640
<v Speaker 1>And I kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to what they're saying,</v>

669
00:30:33.641 --> 00:30:35.710
<v Speaker 1>don't listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

670
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 1>listen to what they tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

671
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.553
<v Speaker 1>so one more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to jump back a little bit </v>

672
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:41.500
<v Speaker 1>before we get into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into Paris.</v>

673
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.513
<v Speaker 1>So I want people to understand there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between someone like </v>

674
00:30:44.171 --> 00:30:46.180
<v Speaker 1>yourself that you consider yourself an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ex Muslim.</v>

675
00:30:46.181 --> 00:30:47.014
<v Speaker 1>You are a nonbeliever versus some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reformers that are still either either </v>

676
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:54.730
<v Speaker 1>believers or that consider themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims.</v>

677
00:30:54.731 --> 00:30:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Someone like imagine new eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although he said to me that,</v>

678
00:30:57.401 --> 00:31:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to put up his version of</v>

679
00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Islam for anyone else but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a distinction there.</v>

680
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:03.994
<v Speaker 1>So there's two brands of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about that are trying to </v>

681
00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:07.384
<v Speaker 1>help here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

682
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean like progressive Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

683
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:11.743
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

684
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.593
<v Speaker 1>Well meaning meaning that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's your branch that's sort of ex </v>

685
00:31:14.971 --> 00:31:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

686
00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:17.490
<v Speaker 1>You fully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are an atheist,</v>

687
00:31:17.491 --> 00:31:18.324
<v Speaker 1>you don't consider yourself part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion versus there are some that are </v>

688
00:31:21.271 --> 00:31:24.820
<v Speaker 1>trying to reform the religion from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside is,</v>

689
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:27.330
<v Speaker 1>is there any sort of interplay with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys?</v>

690
00:31:27.331 --> 00:31:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Are Our people working together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell.</v>

691
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

692
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 2>dishonest for us to work together in the</v>

693
00:31:34.591 --> 00:31:36.760
<v Speaker 2>sense that truly our aims are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

694
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're similar in some ways,</v>

695
00:31:39.211 --> 00:31:40.044
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to make sure that we want to </v>

696
00:31:41.161 --> 00:31:41.994
<v Speaker 2>decrease harm in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to push a secondary result and </v>

697
00:31:44.671 --> 00:31:46.520
<v Speaker 2>push human rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

698
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.433
<v Speaker 2>promoted the best we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But our ways of going about it are so </v>

699
00:31:50.521 --> 00:31:52.950
<v Speaker 2>radically different that I think that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

700
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

701
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm in contact with some of these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I respect them tremendously.</v>

702
00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.300
<v Speaker 2>You're doing wonderful things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagreed with them.</v>

703
00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.950
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is very little about Islam and the</v>

704
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:05.933
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals of Islam as a Sam Harris </v>
<v Speaker 2>says that I agree with on any level and </v>

705
00:32:10.381 --> 00:32:13.050
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for me to find any beauty or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

706
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion or all these wonderful things</v>

707
00:32:15.961 --> 00:32:17.910
<v Speaker 2>that we would ascribe to something so </v>
<v Speaker 2>holy.</v>

708
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't find that in this text.</v>

709
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:20.783
<v Speaker 2>So there isn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with people when they do say </v>

710
00:32:24.241 --> 00:32:25.950
<v Speaker 2>that I'm a little bit extremist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

711
00:32:25.951 --> 00:32:27.040
<v Speaker 2>people say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

712
00:32:27.041 --> 00:32:30.240
<v Speaker 2>you cannot expect everyone to just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>apostatize all at once,</v>

713
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.960
<v Speaker 2>but this is not what I'm pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

714
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to somewhere else who </v>
<v Speaker 2>apostatize all at once,</v>

715
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:35.863
<v Speaker 2>but for me it would be intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 2>dishonest to Google about it on any </v>

716
00:32:38.761 --> 00:32:41.570
<v Speaker 2>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think that there is,</v>

717
00:32:41.571 --> 00:32:42.404
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's atheism and secularism and </v>

718
00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:46.503
<v Speaker 2>rethought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a very strong critique </v>

719
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.513
<v Speaker 2>of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that is very internally </v>

720
00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:54.150
<v Speaker 2>coherent and ethically coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

721
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.043
<v Speaker 2>and this case is one worth making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we're talking about the </v>

722
00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:01.400
<v Speaker 2>marketplace of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important that we show our side and</v>

723
00:33:01.401 --> 00:33:05.150
<v Speaker 2>we put the best case out there and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>land where they'll land.</v>

724
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.350
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting to me.</v>

725
00:33:07.351 --> 00:33:09.600
<v Speaker 1>So in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

726
00:33:09.601 --> 00:33:13.290
<v Speaker 1>your brand here is a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a little cleaner,</v>

727
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.333
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the people that are trying to </v>

728
00:33:15.331 --> 00:33:16.164
<v Speaker 1>reform it from the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't sense that you're judging </v>

729
00:33:18.691 --> 00:33:23.691
<v Speaker 1>them for that as much as it really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier to make a case from your position</v>

730
00:33:24.451 --> 00:33:25.284
<v Speaker 1>because you're just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in thousand year old </v>

731
00:33:27.931 --> 00:33:30.780
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to make a case based on the</v>

732
00:33:30.781 --> 00:33:31.614
<v Speaker 1>world as it is sort of and they're still</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to negotiate and that's what I </v>

733
00:33:34.981 --> 00:33:37.370
<v Speaker 1>see someone like Reza and where I say </v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

734
00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.170
<v Speaker 1>This is someone who's profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishonest all the time,</v>

735
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.183
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's trying to negotiate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world with this religion and then it </v>

736
00:33:44.101 --> 00:33:46.440
<v Speaker 1>uses a lot of words so nobody knows what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about,</v>

737
00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.740
<v Speaker 1>but your case is a lot cleaner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even even if I disagreed with you,</v>

738
00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I would understand the logic more </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensibly.</v>

739
00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.140
<v Speaker 2>I do think that in the case of somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Raza,</v>

740
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:55.983
<v Speaker 2>I think it is condescending towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>other Muslims because I think some </v>

741
00:33:59.171 --> 00:34:00.260
<v Speaker 2>people believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

742
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Muslims will never get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll never get to where you are.</v>

743
00:34:02.951 --> 00:34:05.050
<v Speaker 2>You're expecting too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm expecting too much.</v>

744
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I think this is actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was allowed to make this case,</v>

745
00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.320
<v Speaker 2>most Muslims do not hear anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar to what I have to say.</v>

746
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:14.380
<v Speaker 2>They will never hear anything like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if they did,</v>

747
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it would change things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

748
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:18.430
<v Speaker 2>we don't know yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

749
00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:20.260
<v Speaker 2>And we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know that that's the case.</v>

750
00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now you did this show with me.</v>

751
00:34:21.791 --> 00:34:24.500
<v Speaker 1>They're going to say you're working with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Zionist Nazi and not.</v>

752
00:34:24.501 --> 00:34:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is going to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>now either.</v>

753
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a little bit about being a woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this space because you have a double,</v>

754
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:31.953
<v Speaker 1>a double edge sword,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak here because leaving a </v>

755
00:34:34.421 --> 00:34:35.254
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any religion stuff but particularly </v>

756
00:34:36.521 --> 00:34:37.354
<v Speaker 1>tough to leave Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you couple that with all </v>

757
00:34:40.391 --> 00:34:41.224
<v Speaker 1>the stuff related to being a woman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a secular woman in America in </v>

758
00:34:43.991 --> 00:34:46.110
<v Speaker 1>2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that easy sometimes a,</v>

759
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.490
<v Speaker 1>how does that play into how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you live?</v>

760
00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.053
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let me start by saying there's so </v>

761
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:53.710
<v Speaker 2>many people that I'm connected to </v>
<v Speaker 2>through my,</v>

762
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.240
<v Speaker 2>through the organization and through </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting a bunch of ex Muslims.</v>

763
00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:56.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

764
00:34:56.711 --> 00:34:57.544
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it'd be a stretch to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I probably know more ex Muslims </v>

765
00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:03.860
<v Speaker 2>then most people in the world now will </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever know,</v>

766
00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.480
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

767
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.383
<v Speaker 2>and what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I hear consistently from a lot of </v>

768
00:35:08.391 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 2>women that the reason that they left the</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

769
00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.193
<v Speaker 2>it was because of the treatment of women</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of it just didn't make any </v>

770
00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.830
<v Speaker 2>sense and they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't appreciate.</v>

771
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.330
<v Speaker 2>They felt that they weren't being given </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same kind of dignity as,</v>

772
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:20.223
<v Speaker 2>as men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they looked at it from that </v>

773
00:35:21.021 --> 00:35:22.340
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things changed.</v>

774
00:35:22.341 --> 00:35:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Feminism has to do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very interesting.</v>

775
00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we talk about today is </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism here,</v>

776
00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:28.883
<v Speaker 2>but really found the feminist allies in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the West that I thought I would find I </v>

777
00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:35.750
<v Speaker 2>expected to for them to be the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to run to my defense.</v>

778
00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.120
<v Speaker 2>And a few have but a small few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

779
00:35:39.121 --> 00:35:39.954
<v Speaker 2>I ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I expected there to be a big rally with </v>

780
00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:48.030
<v Speaker 2>the feminists from all over to come and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about these issues,</v>

781
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't found that to be the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

782
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:50.970
<v Speaker 2>It's very disheartening.</v>

783
00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is that strange alliance because</v>

784
00:35:53.591 --> 00:35:54.850
<v Speaker 1>you see this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

785
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:58.270
<v Speaker 1>a group like code pink that stands for </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's rights and antiwar,</v>

786
00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.900
<v Speaker 1>you would think they would be standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for women's rights all over the globe,</v>

787
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:06.640
<v Speaker 1>but instead they'll rant and rave and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about Gaza.</v>

788
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they ever went to Gaza,</v>

789
00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that these women would </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be treated particularly well.</v>

790
00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:13.570
<v Speaker 1>So this double standard just endlessly </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>

791
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

792
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

793
00:36:15.101 --> 00:36:16.190
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

794
00:36:16.191 --> 00:36:17.770
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

795
00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.920
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's disheartening for one and because I</v>

796
00:36:20.921 --> 00:36:21.754
<v Speaker 2>was somebody that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feminism was a huge part of me </v>

797
00:36:24.011 --> 00:36:26.350
<v Speaker 2>leaving religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a huge part of me,</v>

798
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:30.970
<v Speaker 2>a fueling me and the women's rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>causes a fueling me into my activism.</v>

799
00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:35.440
<v Speaker 2>It's been especially painful to see that</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminists are not always on my,</v>

800
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

801
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:36.893
<v Speaker 2>on the same level as me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I have found is that there's a lot </v>

802
00:36:39.131 --> 00:36:43.630
<v Speaker 2>of posts about women that say the Muslim</v>
<v Speaker 2>women that say that they're empowered by</v>

803
00:36:43.631 --> 00:36:44.770
<v Speaker 2>the hijab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

804
00:36:44.771 --> 00:36:46.690
<v Speaker 2>and there'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be on feminist west websites.</v>

805
00:36:46.691 --> 00:36:47.291
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

806
00:36:47.291 --> 00:36:51.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm very empowered by this job and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>my political whatever,</v>

807
00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.500
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's,</v>

808
00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.780
<v Speaker 2>it's wonderful for that particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

809
00:36:55.781 --> 00:36:59.590
<v Speaker 2>If she feels that this is her choice and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what she wants to do and this is</v>

810
00:36:59.591 --> 00:37:01.300
<v Speaker 2>how she wants to live her life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great,</v>

811
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.990
<v Speaker 2>but a Muslim woman that's wearing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hijab up,</v>

812
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:10.230
<v Speaker 2>making a piece like that is like a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Nineteen Thirties America saying that</v>

813
00:37:11.021 --> 00:37:12.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud to be a housewife.</v>

814
00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.550
<v Speaker 2>I love staying home with my children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is exactly where I want to be.</v>

815
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:16.643
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you.</v>

816
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.553
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you do and that's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good for you that everything in </v>

817
00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:23.470
<v Speaker 2>society aligned with your desire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect thing.</v>

818
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh you and now you get to live this </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful life,</v>

819
00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:27.514
<v Speaker 2>but you have to acknowledge the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties America women who may be </v>

820
00:37:30.611 --> 00:37:31.444
<v Speaker 2>wanting to have a career weren't as free</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do so that there were so many </v>

821
00:37:34.541 --> 00:37:36.760
<v Speaker 2>different factors that were making it </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

822
00:37:36.761 --> 00:37:40.030
<v Speaker 2>very difficult for them to live the life</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they wanted to.</v>

823
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.983
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to acknowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then same way I want these hijabi </v>

824
00:37:43.481 --> 00:37:45.100
<v Speaker 2>women to be able to acknowledge that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

825
00:37:45.101 --> 00:37:45.934
<v Speaker 2>there's so many women who don't ascribe </v>
<v Speaker 2>to these modesty codes and they aren't </v>

826
00:37:49.811 --> 00:37:51.700
<v Speaker 2>free to live lives the way they want.</v>

827
00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this again,</v>

828
00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:56.370
<v Speaker 1>this is why the left has put themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the regressive left,</v>

829
00:37:56.371 --> 00:37:57.204
<v Speaker 1>is put themselves in such a crazy box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be defending women's </v>

830
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.823
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to say you have to live </v>

831
00:38:03.451 --> 00:38:04.284
<v Speaker 1>a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they should at least give you the </v>

832
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:09.750
<v Speaker 1>options and that's also why they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been relentless on new atheists.</v>

833
00:38:09.751 --> 00:38:11.370
<v Speaker 1>So you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now as a woman,</v>

834
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:12.204
<v Speaker 1>you get it as an ex Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you identify </v>

835
00:38:14.131 --> 00:38:17.340
<v Speaker 1>specifically with the new atheist with </v>
<v Speaker 1>new atheism,</v>

836
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.570
<v Speaker 1>you consider yourself a new atheist.</v>

837
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:20.840
<v Speaker 2>What does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure exactly.</v>

838
00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really seems to know.</v>

839
00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.820
<v Speaker 1>The best way I can describe it now as </v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

840
00:38:25.821 --> 00:38:26.654
<v Speaker 1>at least as I've come to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's an atheist who is finally </v>

841
00:38:29.361 --> 00:38:30.980
<v Speaker 1>speaking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for that,</v>

842
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.500
<v Speaker 1>for that version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would consider myself.</v>

843
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

844
00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:35.683
<v Speaker 1>but community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left really has been attacking </v>

845
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.040
<v Speaker 1>atheist too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're on a,</v>

846
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:39.903
<v Speaker 1>like a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like spinning and you got shot from all </v>

847
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:43.654
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

848
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely feel that way.</v>

849
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:46.564
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk about how big of a </v>

850
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:49.810
<v Speaker 2>victim I am because I don't like those </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of politics,</v>

851
00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.760
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in general,</v>

852
00:38:51.761 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I have felt that the people that on </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper should be supporting me.</v>

853
00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.653
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I looked into this actually as a </v>

854
00:38:57.911 --> 00:39:00.850
<v Speaker 2>response to seeing the way that leftists</v>
<v Speaker 2>have reacted.</v>

855
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:01.684
<v Speaker 2>I've started to do more research on what</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal principles were and really </v>

856
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.430
<v Speaker 2>trying to get a grounding on what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>meant to be a liberal.</v>

857
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.070
<v Speaker 2>And I feel under Bill Morris said this </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many times.</v>

858
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.933
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I the real liberal and I think he's </v>

859
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's right.</v>

860
00:39:12.401 --> 00:39:15.340
<v Speaker 2>When he says he's a real liberal and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like I'm a real liberal.</v>

861
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not gross and racist.</v>

862
00:39:17.491 --> 00:39:18.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're telling me.</v>

863
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was so bad.</v>

864
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.060
<v Speaker 2>That was so bad and honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

865
00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:24.894
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I was watching that I kind </v>

866
00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:27.564
<v Speaker 2>of felt I'm going to get haters to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it kind of or been Africa little </v>

867
00:39:32.161 --> 00:39:32.770
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of thought,</v>

868
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cute that he's standing up.</v>

869
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.460
<v Speaker 2>He thinks he's standing up for the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed minority.</v>

870
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he thinks he's doing.</v>

871
00:39:40.081 --> 00:39:40.914
<v Speaker 2>That's what he's really convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's standing up for an oppressed group </v>

872
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.120
<v Speaker 2>and it's nice that he has good </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentions,</v>

873
00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:46.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that,</v>

874
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.573
<v Speaker 2>but he's so wrong and he's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting these same minorities and he's </v>

875
00:39:50.491 --> 00:39:52.530
<v Speaker 2>not understanding exactly what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on here.</v>

876
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:53.783
<v Speaker 2>And it was very interesting in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular scenario to see Sam and then </v>

877
00:39:56.791 --> 00:39:58.770
<v Speaker 2>very emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

878
00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:01.560
<v Speaker 2>very emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Affleck and very calm Sam Harris.</v>

879
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll find this interesting.</v>

880
00:40:03.171 --> 00:40:04.004
<v Speaker 1>I was discussing this with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first off I discussed it with Sam </v>

881
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.860
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also discussed it with Joe Rogan a</v>

882
00:40:09.861 --> 00:40:11.600
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks ago on his show and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

883
00:40:11.601 --> 00:40:13.190
<v Speaker 1>what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

884
00:40:13.191 --> 00:40:13.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

885
00:40:13.551 --> 00:40:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I think he was trying to do the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and trying to.</v>

886
00:40:16.971 --> 00:40:18.860
<v Speaker 1>And maybe he got too emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

887
00:40:18.861 --> 00:40:21.380
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to stand up for the down </v>
<v Speaker 1>trodden,</v>

888
00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.423
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Joe said something that I now fully </v>

889
00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:25.071
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

890
00:40:25.071 --> 00:40:26.870
<v Speaker 1>he got me to change my opinion like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

891
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.831
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

892
00:40:27.831 --> 00:40:28.460
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

893
00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I know actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm around actors.</v>

894
00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.450
<v Speaker 1>They fate this so that everyone will </v>
<v Speaker 1>just think they're so holy there.</v>

895
00:40:35.451 --> 00:40:38.630
<v Speaker 1>So benevolent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so wonderful and all that.</v>

896
00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:39.464
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was really convinced that that's </v>

897
00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:41.780
<v Speaker 1>what Ben was doing there.</v>

898
00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.660
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to waste anymore.</v>

899
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.860
<v Speaker 1>A lot more time on that specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

900
00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.090
<v Speaker 1>so the atheist stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

901
00:40:50.091 --> 00:40:51.620
<v Speaker 1>you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting it from them,</v>

902
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.560
<v Speaker 1>you're getting it from the other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do then what,</v>

903
00:40:55.561 --> 00:40:58.400
<v Speaker 1>what can secular people and free </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers do?</v>

904
00:40:58.401 --> 00:41:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Because I know that people just by </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this,</v>

905
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:03.523
<v Speaker 1>a certain subset of people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say all the things that you laid out at </v>

906
00:41:05.601 --> 00:41:06.434
<v Speaker 1>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to say that I hate </v>

907
00:41:07.581 --> 00:41:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you're a secret Zionist.</v>

908
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:13.430
<v Speaker 1>All of this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what can we do?</v>

909
00:41:13.431 --> 00:41:14.630
<v Speaker 1>I guess just talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

910
00:41:14.631 --> 00:41:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really that the best we can do</v>

911
00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:17.243
<v Speaker 2>so I think just be intellectually honest</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that a lot of people </v>

912
00:41:20.531 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 2>understand what I mean when I say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people stop themselves.</v>

913
00:41:23.921 --> 00:41:24.754
<v Speaker 2>They want to say these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have these opinions and the </v>

914
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 2>reaction that I got to my speech at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American Humanist Association,</v>

915
00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:33.990
<v Speaker 2>the biggest reaction was you said what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to say you.</v>

916
00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:36.590
<v Speaker 2>You put the words that I was thinking in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my head,</v>

917
00:41:36.591 --> 00:41:37.424
<v Speaker 2>but I just felt like I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really couldn't articulate and I felt </v>

918
00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:43.880
<v Speaker 2>trapped and you said those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it felt like a release,</v>

919
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:44.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

920
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:45.283
<v Speaker 2>for me to hear you say it for to hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody say it and I think that if we </v>

921
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:52.460
<v Speaker 2>can be brave and if we can talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially liberals,</v>

922
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:53.294
<v Speaker 2>it is very important that it is liberals</v>
<v Speaker 2>who stand up for this because we were </v>

923
00:41:56.441 --> 00:41:57.560
<v Speaker 2>the compassionate ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

924
00:41:57.561 --> 00:42:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really are keeping the harm of that</v>

925
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:02.083
<v Speaker 2>of the people in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not forgetting about anti Muslim </v>

926
00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:05.690
<v Speaker 2>bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is something that is,</v>

927
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.570
<v Speaker 2>that is obviously at the forefront of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our minds.</v>

928
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.880
<v Speaker 2>We know that because that's why we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not saying anything about this,</v>

929
00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 2>of this harm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it is those,</v>

930
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:14.924
<v Speaker 2>particularly those people that need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be speaking about the need to be making </v>

931
00:42:17.841 --> 00:42:19.310
<v Speaker 2>this nuance discussion.</v>

932
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:20.303
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what it seems so obvious to </v>

933
00:42:21.901 --> 00:42:22.734
<v Speaker 1>me that I don't have to twist my beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say the things that I'm saying to </v>

934
00:42:27.481 --> 00:42:28.314
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that I'm saying to you and I </v>

935
00:42:29.191 --> 00:42:30.024
<v Speaker 1>sense everything that you're saying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me is based in the same set of secular </v>

936
00:42:33.601 --> 00:42:38.010
<v Speaker 1>principles that you apply to everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else and for some reason these guys want</v>

937
00:42:38.011 --> 00:42:42.090
<v Speaker 1>you to just be a little more careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to this set of ideas.</v>

938
00:42:42.091 --> 00:42:42.924
<v Speaker 1>But what I see as the real danger there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if we don't speak up right now </v>

939
00:42:47.341 --> 00:42:48.174
<v Speaker 1>and we're editing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're an extremely precarious moment </v>

940
00:42:49.921 --> 00:42:53.880
<v Speaker 1>right now with everything going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris and with Isis and all that.</v>

941
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.833
<v Speaker 1>That if we don't speak up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hand the future to the people on the </v>

942
00:42:57.151 --> 00:42:57.984
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

943
00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>

944
00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.190
<v Speaker 2>They're getting empowered by this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people are not stupid.</v>

945
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:03.683
<v Speaker 2>We are seeing that there is this big </v>
<v Speaker 2>elephant in the room that people we </v>

946
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.070
<v Speaker 2>cannot talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the media isn't talking about,</v>

947
00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.083
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're building distrust of your average </v>

948
00:43:11.161 --> 00:43:11.994
<v Speaker 2>American citizen when they're watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>their TV screens and they're not seeing </v>

949
00:43:14.431 --> 00:43:17.880
<v Speaker 2>anybody but Fox News really talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Islam in a way that,</v>

950
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:21.090
<v Speaker 2>that feels remotely honest and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

951
00:43:21.091 --> 00:43:23.970
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're giving this up to these people who</v>

952
00:43:23.971 --> 00:43:27.480
<v Speaker 2>really have some Zena phobic motives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the,</v>

953
00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:28.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we need to make sure that it is us </v>

954
00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.520
<v Speaker 2>that are talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are engaging with this issue.</v>

955
00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:33.563
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's similar to I think what happened </v>

956
00:43:34.561 --> 00:43:35.760
<v Speaker 2>with the tea party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

957
00:43:35.761 --> 00:43:36.594
<v Speaker 2>I think there was some real hurt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some real pain right after the economic </v>

958
00:43:40.831 --> 00:43:42.870
<v Speaker 2>downturn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of people were feeling</v>

959
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:45.570
<v Speaker 2>abandoned by their government and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think we could have,</v>

960
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.613
<v Speaker 2>I even say now we could have seized on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that moment and we could have made it a </v>

961
00:43:49.381 --> 00:43:51.930
<v Speaker 2>populist progressive movement to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

962
00:43:51.931 --> 00:43:52.764
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations or whatever it is we could </v>

963
00:43:53.881 --> 00:43:54.090
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

964
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:54.923
<v Speaker 2>We could have harnessed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead we disdain those people </v>

965
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:58.150
<v Speaker 2>because they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

966
00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.300
<v Speaker 2>backwater bigots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

967
00:44:00.301 --> 00:44:03.690
<v Speaker 2>people who were very uncommon that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand things in a nuanced,</v>

968
00:44:03.691 --> 00:44:06.330
<v Speaker 2>complicated way the way that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else does.</v>

969
00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.700
<v Speaker 2>And so we find it very easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

970
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.490
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just push them aside and dismiss them</v>

971
00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.200
<v Speaker 2>and look at what happened there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

972
00:44:13.201 --> 00:44:14.034
<v Speaker 2>They became a political force that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people would say had done some harm </v>

973
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:20.130
<v Speaker 2>political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't want that happening again.</v>

974
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:21.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw my video about </v>

975
00:44:21.761 --> 00:44:22.594
<v Speaker 1>it a couple of weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I said that the regressive left is </v>

976
00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:25.923
<v Speaker 1>our tea party and I don't want what has </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to the right that has been </v>

977
00:44:29.651 --> 00:44:33.480
<v Speaker 1>dragged off the deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that happening to my side.</v>

978
00:44:33.481 --> 00:44:36.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why I do think we're at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

979
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.983
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know we only have a little bit </v>

980
00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:40.050
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do want to focus on Paris a little</v>

981
00:44:40.051 --> 00:44:41.130
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're not a,</v>

982
00:44:41.131 --> 00:44:44.610
<v Speaker 1>you're not a terrorist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a expert or something of that nature.</v>

983
00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of the,</v>

984
00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:48.093
<v Speaker 1>the human part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it sounds like a lot of these </v>

985
00:44:50.131 --> 00:44:53.250
<v Speaker 1>people did grow up in Paris or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>

986
00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:54.960
<v Speaker 1>They grew up in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them grew up in Belgium,</v>

987
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.470
<v Speaker 1>but they grew up in western societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

988
00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.590
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>radicalization because,</v>

989
00:45:01.591 --> 00:45:02.424
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of the debate right now is </v>

990
00:45:03.151 --> 00:45:03.984
<v Speaker 1>about can we let refugees in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we going to let terrorists in with </v>

991
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:07.284
<v Speaker 1>refugees in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also a home grown grown </v>

992
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:11.160
<v Speaker 1>problem right now that we're not dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

993
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:12.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

994
00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.890
<v Speaker 2>This is my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just my opinion,</v>

995
00:45:14.891 --> 00:45:16.540
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a scholar on this,</v>

996
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.153
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like there are many young </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in different parts of Europe </v>

997
00:45:21.911 --> 00:45:22.744
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you were particularly that </v>

998
00:45:24.431 --> 00:45:25.264
<v Speaker 2>feel that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people say they're between </v>

999
00:45:26.771 --> 00:45:27.604
<v Speaker 2>two cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the phrase that people use at </v>

1000
00:45:28.931 --> 00:45:31.210
<v Speaker 2>there between this western culture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their culture back home.</v>

1001
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.433
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think that that's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the truth is that they </v>

1002
00:45:35.441 --> 00:45:36.274
<v Speaker 2>don't really have any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't really have any viable </v>

1003
00:45:38.951 --> 00:45:39.784
<v Speaker 2>options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't really believe in the same </v>

1004
00:45:41.801 --> 00:45:45.040
<v Speaker 2>stuff that their parents might have done</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Pakistan or whatever and they don't</v>

1005
00:45:45.041 --> 00:45:45.874
<v Speaker 2>really fit in with the community in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>west and they sort of feel lost by this </v>

1006
00:45:50.171 --> 00:45:52.180
<v Speaker 2>multiculturalists narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1007
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:57.430
<v Speaker 2>That if we can push a and then in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people do have a specific critique,</v>

1008
00:45:57.641 --> 00:46:01.210
<v Speaker 2>they say that we have lost our bearings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have lost our values,</v>

1009
00:46:01.211 --> 00:46:04.230
<v Speaker 2>we don't really push our story and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>values and our,</v>

1010
00:46:04.231 --> 00:46:06.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on our way of looking at the world.</v>

1011
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:11.200
<v Speaker 2>We don't really advocate for that in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that it deserves to be advocated for</v>

1012
00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:13.420
<v Speaker 2>and I think these are the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are there,</v>

1013
00:46:13.421 --> 00:46:14.254
<v Speaker 2>the lost children of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because these are people who don't have </v>

1014
00:46:16.361 --> 00:46:18.730
<v Speaker 2>anything so they don't have anything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>latch onto.</v>

1015
00:46:18.731 --> 00:46:21.570
<v Speaker 2>What they do have to latch onto is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody comes and says this,</v>

1016
00:46:21.571 --> 00:46:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Islam is narrow and everything makes so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much sense and it's.</v>

1017
00:46:24.701 --> 00:46:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Everything is so clear now and they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>grapple onto it.</v>

1018
00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I think you've covered this so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

1019
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.260
<v Speaker 2>You've talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about freedom of speech issues,</v>

1020
00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:34.390
<v Speaker 2>about how we're not allowed to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about certain ideas.</v>

1021
00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.373
<v Speaker 2>I think it's so harmful that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to talk about critique of </v>

1022
00:46:37.421 --> 00:46:39.160
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>critique of Islam,</v>

1023
00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:42.510
<v Speaker 2>because we're then we're giving up this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground to,</v>

1024
00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.520
<v Speaker 2>to the Islamists were letting them give </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

1025
00:46:45.521 --> 00:46:46.354
<v Speaker 2>these are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these great narratives that they'll </v>

1026
00:46:48.101 --> 00:46:51.940
<v Speaker 2>latch onto and they don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposing narrative at all.</v>

1027
00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1028
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.100
<v Speaker 1>so what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1029
00:46:54.101 --> 00:46:54.934
<v Speaker 1>really what are the secular is do I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are some organizations like </v>

1030
00:46:57.461 --> 00:47:01.360
<v Speaker 1>the one that module is involved in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to deradicalize people,</v>

1031
00:47:01.361 --> 00:47:03.880
<v Speaker 1>show them that there's other out and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm with you.</v>

1032
00:47:03.881 --> 00:47:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

1033
00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:08.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a compounding of economic issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1034
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:13.360
<v Speaker 1>and religious narrative and imperial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all of these things.</v>

1035
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:14.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do we move forward because the </v>

1036
00:47:16.091 --> 00:47:18.040
<v Speaker 1>talking as we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good for now,</v>

1037
00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.280
<v Speaker 1>but at some point we got to get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1038
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:24.310
<v Speaker 1>to the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're the younger generation.</v>

1039
00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something I,</v>

1040
00:47:26.731 --> 00:47:29.530
<v Speaker 2>you could get is related to the Syrian </v>
<v Speaker 2>refugees are coming in,</v>

1041
00:47:29.531 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are very worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the effect that these refugees will have</v>

1042
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:33.663
<v Speaker 2>on the countries and I think the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm way of proceeding and making </v>

1043
00:47:37.841 --> 00:47:38.674
<v Speaker 2>sure that we don't have these same kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of problems is to push emergent as much </v>

1044
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:43.894
<v Speaker 2>as we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that we don't allow them to </v>

1045
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.440
<v Speaker 2>build these isolated little communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We spread them out within a,</v>

1046
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:53.980
<v Speaker 2>within the country and we pull them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the American way of life or Western</v>

1047
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:54.910
<v Speaker 2>way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What have you.</v>

1048
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that sense,</v>

1049
00:47:56.681 --> 00:47:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of these multicultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives are very,</v>

1050
00:47:59.411 --> 00:48:00.250
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very harmful.</v>

1051
00:48:00.251 --> 00:48:02.110
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to discard them </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

1052
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.490
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1053
00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.710
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of hesitancy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know,</v>

1054
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.510
<v Speaker 2>we know how to pull immigrants in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to immerse them into our,</v>

1055
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.500
<v Speaker 2>our study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that there is so much.</v>

1056
00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.130
<v Speaker 2>There was so much work about this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarly stuff about this written about</v>

1057
00:48:15.131 --> 00:48:16.360
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can do it.</v>

1058
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:18.880
<v Speaker 2>We're a nation of immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want it to right.</v>

1059
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Every one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of us here in America,</v>

1060
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:22.943
<v Speaker 1>we either are from immigrants or we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought over as slaves or were native </v>

1061
00:48:27.421 --> 00:48:28.254
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the large majority of us are </v>

1062
00:48:30.931 --> 00:48:31.764
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>

1063
00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:32.261
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1064
00:48:32.261 --> 00:48:34.700
<v Speaker 2>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what happened was America pulled</v>

1065
00:48:34.701 --> 00:48:36.740
<v Speaker 2>us in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here's the stuff I don't like,</v>

1066
00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:37.663
<v Speaker 2>but here's the stuff I do like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they pulled it together and we </v>

1067
00:48:39.441 --> 00:48:43.280
<v Speaker 2>became this nation that is so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what you have instead in places</v>

1068
00:48:43.281 --> 00:48:44.114
<v Speaker 2>like the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it these many nations that are not a </v>

1069
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.140
<v Speaker 2>part of the overall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1070
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>British society,</v>

1071
00:48:49.341 --> 00:48:50.174
<v Speaker 2>there's little Pakistani community and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little north African Community and they </v>

1072
00:48:53.361 --> 00:48:54.194
<v Speaker 2>sort of live as if there were back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan or Bangladesh or whatever it </v>

1073
00:48:57.381 --> 00:48:58.214
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that I think is so harmful because </v>

1074
00:48:59.871 --> 00:49:02.650
<v Speaker 2>these people never feel like everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1075
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I feel like an American and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think everyone else does and I want them</v>

1076
00:49:06.801 --> 00:49:08.750
<v Speaker 2>to feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them to feel like an American.</v>

1077
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting.</v>

1078
00:49:10.011 --> 00:49:12.950
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a self fulfilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>prophecy because then when,</v>

1079
00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:17.090
<v Speaker 1>when the British people go in and try </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go move into that community,</v>

1080
00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:20.330
<v Speaker 1>then they feel like those people in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>community feel like they're under attack</v>

1081
00:49:20.331 --> 00:49:23.390
<v Speaker 1>or something or they have to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>their little area.</v>

1082
00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.080
<v Speaker 1>So you have this constant battle of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:30.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the self versus the bigger community.</v>

1084
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:31.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>

1085
00:49:31.151 --> 00:49:33.410
<v Speaker 2>what has happened is that we've given up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the battle,</v>

1086
00:49:33.411 --> 00:49:34.161
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've just said,</v>

1087
00:49:34.161 --> 00:49:34.994
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just live however you want to </v>

1088
00:49:35.511 --> 00:49:36.344
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just different people and you </v>

1089
00:49:37.131 --> 00:49:37.964
<v Speaker 2>just operate on different rules and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have different concepts of human rights </v>

1090
00:49:40.431 --> 00:49:42.050
<v Speaker 2>and that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to turn a blind eye.</v>

1091
00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:43.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what's happened in the UK I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

1092
00:49:43.701 --> 00:49:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:45.230
<v Speaker 1>And we can't do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1094
00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:46.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to have these.</v>

1095
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:47.643
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've always had with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrant communities in the United </v>

1096
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.470
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these negotiations,</v>

1097
00:49:50.471 --> 00:49:51.304
<v Speaker 2>these back and forths with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>scuffles and sometimes I've been very </v>

1098
00:49:53.711 --> 00:49:54.544
<v Speaker 2>painful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the end we're stronger and the </v>

1099
00:49:55.811 --> 00:49:58.150
<v Speaker 2>immigrant community gets immersed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stronger too.</v>

1100
00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1101
00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.013
<v Speaker 1>So my final thought would be A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to end all my </v>

1102
00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:06.140
<v Speaker 1>conversations on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a note of positiveness,</v>

1103
00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.183
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you've actually given a lot </v>

1104
00:50:08.181 --> 00:50:09.014
<v Speaker 1>of hope throughout here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely sense that the tide is </v>

1105
00:50:13.011 --> 00:50:13.844
<v Speaker 1>turning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it feels like a dangerous time </v>

1106
00:50:15.051 --> 00:50:15.884
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much craziness going on and </v>

1107
00:50:18.471 --> 00:50:20.390
<v Speaker 1>with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything feels smaller.</v>

1108
00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:22.520
<v Speaker 1>So when something happens 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles away,</v>

1109
00:50:22.521 --> 00:50:24.110
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it happened in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard.</v>

1110
00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:26.720
<v Speaker 1>But I do send something good here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we've,</v>

1111
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:28.363
<v Speaker 1>the fact that all of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that we're all in the same circles </v>

1112
00:50:31.221 --> 00:50:34.310
<v Speaker 1>and we're all talking and our circles </v>
<v Speaker 1>are getting bigger,</v>

1113
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.353
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do feel like maybe the tide will turn </v>

1114
00:50:36.981 --> 00:50:38.150
<v Speaker 1>in our favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

1115
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.940
<v Speaker 1>do you feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me something good to end down here.</v>

1116
00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:43.800
<v Speaker 2>I think you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've mentioned this before.</v>

1117
00:50:43.801 --> 00:50:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that things are changing and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel this and I think marginalized.</v>

1118
00:50:46.691 --> 00:50:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I've said it to before where you said </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left is changing and he feels this.</v>

1119
00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:54.060
<v Speaker 2>You can sort of be it in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is discontent there,</v>

1120
00:50:54.061 --> 00:50:54.894
<v Speaker 2>that there's people were suddenly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of dissonance going on </v>

1121
00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:01.350
<v Speaker 2>people's minds and we want it to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense and I think that we're giving,</v>

1122
00:51:01.351 --> 00:51:02.184
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this point of view that we're giving is </v>

1123
00:51:03.421 --> 00:51:07.560
<v Speaker 2>one that is so much more clear and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much better for people and better for</v>

1124
00:51:07.561 --> 00:51:11.550
<v Speaker 2>humanity and I think people will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will slowly gravitate towards it.</v>

1125
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:12.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1126
00:51:12.201 --> 00:51:13.034
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a video on free speech last week </v>

1127
00:51:14.361 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 1>at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end I referenced,</v>

1128
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff we say safe spaces and</v>

1129
00:51:18.321 --> 00:51:19.154
<v Speaker 1>trigger warnings and all of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense and it's like when I speak to </v>

1130
00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:24.910
<v Speaker 1>someone like you and I speak to them an </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ion and Sam at all,</v>

1131
00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 1>you'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said in the video,</v>

1132
00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look guys,</v>

1133
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 1>watch my videos with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think these are the extremists,</v>

1134
00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.100
<v Speaker 1>then there's something wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something wrong with them.</v>

1135
00:51:34.101 --> 00:51:34.934
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my June Sam just wrote a book called </v>

1136
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:36.883
<v Speaker 1>Islam in the future of tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't called Islam and the future </v>

1137
00:51:39.591 --> 00:51:40.424
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1138
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.200
<v Speaker 1>weapons of mass destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1139
00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

1140
00:51:43.821 --> 00:51:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an absolute pleasure.</v>

1141
