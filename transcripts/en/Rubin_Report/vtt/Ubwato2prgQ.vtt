1
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's shift altogether.</v>

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really know.</v>

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>How about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biology.</v>

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I thought this would be an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to start.</v>

6
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:16.734
<v Speaker 1>You just recently did a talk with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins just in the last couple </v>

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.440
<v Speaker 1>of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>as I understand the video of it should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be up online somewhat soon.</v>

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>It will be up within a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully people will be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually watch this conversation.</v>

11
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.023
<v Speaker 1>I'm very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this event was put together by </v>

12
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:35.904
<v Speaker 1>Pangbourne philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a little tumbled around </v>

13
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>that and I know you just wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly address what's going on there.</v>

14
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.673
<v Speaker 1>So pangbourne philosophy is obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>imploded and that has left people </v>

15
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:50.304
<v Speaker 1>speculating about what happened and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of us like myself continue to </v>

16
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>participate with Pangbourne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just very quickly for people that have</v>

17
00:00:57.301 --> 00:00:58.134
<v Speaker 1>no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were putting together a lot of the </v>

18
00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.963
<v Speaker 1>public events that included a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the one that you moderated with </v>

19
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver.</v>

20
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Also the one that Douglas Murray </v>
<v Speaker 1>moderated,</v>

21
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:08.124
<v Speaker 1>which I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that in the UK or was that </v>

22
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Australia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One in Dublin and one in London.</v>

23
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.133
<v Speaker 1>and then a series of other events like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that you did with Dawkins and </v>

25
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>this this day of reflection that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to happen on November 17th that</v>

26
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>we all pulled out of which now I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take it from there.</v>

27
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

28
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.243
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just say that I know that there </v>

29
00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>is a lot of speculation about what took </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

30
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>why people pulled out of the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>

31
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:33.804
<v Speaker 1>why some of us like myself stayed in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in at the point that it was </v>

32
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.703
<v Speaker 1>canceled a couple of days ago and I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope people will recognize that there </v>

33
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>was a predicament for those of us like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>like myself and like Eric who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the,</v>

35
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.453
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pangbourne situation and trying to </v>

36
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:54.324
<v Speaker 1>figure out what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was at the point that Pangbourne </v>

37
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>canceled the Auckland event.</v>

38
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Something new emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other events had been canceled,</v>

39
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>but there had always been refunds for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who had bought tickets.</v>

40
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>At the point he canceled the Auckland </v>
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

41
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.553
<v Speaker 1>There was a lack of refund money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which called our attention to the fact </v>

42
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:19.581
<v Speaker 1>that something was off money that should</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been kept separately for that event</v>

43
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>so that if it was canceled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could have all been refunded,</v>

44
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>somehow wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we didn't know.</v>

45
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

46
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.153
<v Speaker 1>and I think not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys hadn't been paid for some </v>

47
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:29.334
<v Speaker 1>previous things too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't just about the people that </v>

48
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.470
<v Speaker 1>were buying the tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>

49
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an auckland,</v>

50
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>it was Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sydney is where speakers,</v>

51
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.573
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where speakers didn't get paid </v>

52
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:41.184
<v Speaker 1>for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm certainly one of the people who </v>

53
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.470
<v Speaker 1>didn't get paid and still haven't been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

54
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also as a sidebar,</v>

55
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:47.424
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is why I pulled out of the day </v>

56
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>of reflection thing in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to host the whole day,</v>

57
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>but then when I realized that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't been paid for previous things and</v>

58
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:56.454
<v Speaker 1>I had heard through the grapevine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some shady stuff going on and </v>

59
00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.144
<v Speaker 1>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

60
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.363
<v Speaker 1>let me just</v>

61
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.940
<v Speaker 1>get involved in this mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's right,</v>

62
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>which makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>So I think what I did also makes perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

64
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>which is I looked at the situation and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

65
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.873
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got people who haven't been </v>

66
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.213
<v Speaker 1>refunded their money for Auckland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got speakers from Sydney who </v>

67
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:20.551
<v Speaker 1>haven't been paid and if the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>event comes apart,</v>

68
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.293
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to compound that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to create a new ticket </v>

69
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>holders who haven't been paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

70
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.073
<v Speaker 1>and so my thought was let's have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>event that gives people what they paid </v>

71
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>for so that we don't make the damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

72
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>And I certainly didn't sign up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything new after the Auckland.</v>

73
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>A event was canceled and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure to repay patrons.</v>

74
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:45.514
<v Speaker 1>But my thought was from the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of a protecting the fan base from </v>

75
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever was going on a behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes at Pangbourne,</v>

76
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.873
<v Speaker 1>the better part of valor was to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>event happen and be successful rather </v>

77
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>than create another auckland situation.</v>

78
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.663
<v Speaker 1>So in any case that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I should also point out that up </v>

79
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:12.961
<v Speaker 1>until so Pangbourne gave us a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of warning just a couple of</v>

80
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.123
<v Speaker 1>days before he canceled it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he was about to cancel it and </v>

81
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Eric and I tried to save it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

82
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Eric who had pulled out of the event </v>
<v Speaker 1>quietly so as not to cripple it,</v>

83
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.233
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and I got on the phone with Travis </v>

84
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.523
<v Speaker 1>and we tried to get travis to agree to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold the event and to lead us rescue </v>

85
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:37.594
<v Speaker 1>that we offered to work for free and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have liked to have held the event </v>

86
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>so that it wouldn't cause further harm </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

87
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know why Travis refused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did.</v>

88
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got canceled and I,</v>

89
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

90
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.033
<v Speaker 1>I do want people to understand that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not that anybody was unaware that </v>

91
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:05.821
<v Speaker 1>something was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question was what's best for the fan</v>

92
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.110
<v Speaker 1>base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movement,</v>

93
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:08.944
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that there is a movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it better to have another event </v>

94
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>canceled and have more harm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think so.</v>

95
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know this is all a little insider </v>

96
00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:16.694
<v Speaker 2>baseball for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I know you just wanted to get that </v>

97
00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:20.060
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm glad that it is a few of us.</v>

98
00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:20.894
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had discussed possibly doing a free </v>

99
00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:23.624
<v Speaker 2>thing and who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there will be something in the </v>

100
00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:25.694
<v Speaker 2>future if people ended up getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>stiffed on ticket prices because </v>

101
00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:28.304
<v Speaker 2>obviously we want people to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and if we can all figure it </v>

102
00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:30.711
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will.</v>

103
00:05:30.711 --> 00:05:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that being said,</v>

104
00:05:31.671 --> 00:05:32.504
<v Speaker 2>you did do an event with Richard Dawkins</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we said the video should be up soon </v>

105
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:35.960
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago,</v>

106
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 2>what should we expect from this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

107
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.350
<v Speaker 2>I think on its face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people would say,</v>

108
00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:43.184
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

109
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.690
<v Speaker 2>we've got Weinstein and Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys should agree on everything,</v>

110
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.823
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't they?</v>

111
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this goes back to the question of what </v>

112
00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:56.591
<v Speaker 1>happened to evolutionary biology 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and um,</v>

113
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>darkens and I do agree on a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount,</v>

114
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.710
<v Speaker 1>but the place at which we start </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeing I think is a,</v>

115
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.783
<v Speaker 1>the branching point where you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way evolutionary theory went 30 years </v>

116
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>ago and the way it should have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

117
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>that's not an indictment in and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

118
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.553
<v Speaker 1>Fields take wrong turns all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what should happen is you should </v>

119
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>detect that you're on the wrong path </v>
<v Speaker 1>because suddenly progress,</v>

120
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ceases and that didn't happen.</v>

121
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.323
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what actually happened 30 years ago </v>

122
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>that got us that ironically a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that the,</v>

123
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.503
<v Speaker 1>the last piece of progress that we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>really agree now there's been lots of </v>

124
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.813
<v Speaker 1>empirical work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the last piece of theoretical </v>

125
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 1>progress actually involves a Dawkins' </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish gene,</v>

126
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>which essentially encapsulates a </v>
<v Speaker 1>synthesis that does lots of things,</v>

127
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.443
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings a proper theory of cultural </v>

128
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>evolution online.</v>

129
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Which cultural evolution is a non issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>for almost all creatures.</v>

130
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 1>But for birds and mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal.</v>

131
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:08.294
<v Speaker 1>And for human beings it is the big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to the extent that we did not have a </v>

132
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:17.270
<v Speaker 1>way of discussing cultural evolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to the selfish gene doctrines,</v>

133
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 1>introduction of the concept of memes </v>
<v Speaker 1>which have now been trivialized by,</v>

134
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:22.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people putting funny captions on </v>

135
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the concept of,</v>

136
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:25.634
<v Speaker 1>I think you could argue they've become </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most relevant way of communication </v>

137
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>in a bizarre way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

138
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 1>but they'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've become,</v>

139
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little tidbits become little bites and </v>

140
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:35.144
<v Speaker 1>the fact is almost everything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings that is interesting and </v>

141
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:40.304
<v Speaker 1>special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least touches cultural evolution if </v>

142
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>not is entirely housed there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in order to understand ourselves,</v>

143
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 1>we have to get this cultural evolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing straight and documents set us,</v>

144
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the right path.</v>

145
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Chapter Eleven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he introduces the word meme,</v>

146
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>he introduces the concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sets us in motion,</v>

147
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but he makes an error in that chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No big deal.</v>

148
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.083
<v Speaker 1>We all make errors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't been corrected in 30 </v>

149
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

150
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that error?</v>

151
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.453
<v Speaker 1>The error is in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a misportrayed of the relationship </v>

152
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.973
<v Speaker 1>between culture and its evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>units and genes and the way that they </v>

153
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:18.044
<v Speaker 1>evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what Dawkins says in that chapter is </v>

154
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.050
<v Speaker 1>that means the units of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution exists in a new primeval soup,</v>

155
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:27.201
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

156
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:28.034
<v Speaker 1>this is a new kind of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It begins at the point that culture </v>

157
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:31.784
<v Speaker 1>begins to happen and it is independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the genes that cannot be the case </v>

158
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.713
<v Speaker 1>cannot be the case because the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that you are able to pick up </v>

159
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:44.474
<v Speaker 1>units of cultural evolution is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a brain that your genes </v>

160
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 1>created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hospitable to those things,</v>

161
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Speaker 1>which means that to the extent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

162
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.943
<v Speaker 1>a culture starts wasting the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy and the resources of your </v>

163
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:01.224
<v Speaker 1>genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genes are in a perfect position to </v>

164
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:03.834
<v Speaker 1>shut it down.</v>

165
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.423
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my point to dokkens on stage in </v>

166
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:08.844
<v Speaker 1>Chicago was that can't be right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you make an adjustment to the </v>

167
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.910
<v Speaker 1>theory that you presented to the 1976,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you adjust it correctly,</v>

168
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:22.853
<v Speaker 1>you discover that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many things that are paradoxical about </v>

169
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.273
<v Speaker 1>cultural evolution are no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical and many things about human </v>

170
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:36.330
<v Speaker 1>beings are suddenly tractable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you give me an example of that?</v>

171
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I can give you the ultimate example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will accept that.</v>

172
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:44.241
<v Speaker 1>And so the ultimate example has to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a religion and things that function</v>

173
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about,</v>

174
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.931
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:52.970
<v Speaker 1>this is the antithesis of some little </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture with a caption on it,</v>

176
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Imagine Catholicism,</v>

177
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism is a set of beliefs that has</v>

178
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.910
<v Speaker 1>profound implications on the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>believers deploy their efforts,</v>

179
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 1>their resources to things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevate,</v>

180
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>the things that they issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

181
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.510
<v Speaker 1>So the question is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

182
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.643
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Docklands and I would agree there is no </v>

183
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.320
<v Speaker 1>supernatural explanation necessary to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.720
<v Speaker 1>interpret what is taking place on earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anywhere else in the universe.</v>

185
00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:29.700
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a supernatural </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

186
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were trying to explain phenomena.</v>

187
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.313
<v Speaker 1>So why is it that people who hold a </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief that supernatural forces are at </v>

188
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:43.761
<v Speaker 1>the heart of a human affairs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are those people so successful?</v>

189
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the question.</v>

190
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 1>And Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I disagree with it,</v>

191
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I would disagree over it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.413
<v Speaker 1>because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has this view of what cultural </v>

193
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 1>evolution is that it's independent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>genes.</v>

194
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I say it is actually much more flexible </v>
<v Speaker 1>than jeans,</v>

195
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 1>but it is subordinate to the will of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genes.</v>

196
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he also does not subscribe.</v>

197
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.183
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came around a bit on this on stage I </v>

198
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:11.350
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

199
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 1>but he also does not subscribe to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 1>a lineage level interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>

201
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:20.903
<v Speaker 1>He is a traditional kin selectionist who</v>
<v Speaker 1>believes effectively that the </v>

202
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:26.214
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the gene and the individual or the </v>

203
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>places that we must interpret a </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

204
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:34.770
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then lots of things are paradoxical,</v>

205
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>hard to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe intractable.</v>

206
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.280
<v Speaker 1>If you accept that lineages evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

207
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 1>that adaptation can apply to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lineage.</v>

208
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Then you can begin to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena like a religious traditions as</v>

209
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:55.730
<v Speaker 1>adaptive properties of a population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

210
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.773
<v Speaker 1>there is tremendous progress to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened on stage with Dawkins </v>

211
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.930
<v Speaker 1>was at dinner prior to the event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we more or less agreed that I would lead</v>

212
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:14.200
<v Speaker 1>the discussion because I had a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we disagreed and he would react to</v>

213
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:15.034
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I put together a list of points on </v>

214
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 1>which I was certain that we agreed </v>
<v Speaker 1>points on,</v>

215
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>which I was pretty sure we disagreed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>points on,</v>

216
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:26.200
<v Speaker 1>which I wasn't sure which way to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

217
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 1>which we didn't get to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

218
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:29.224
<v Speaker 1>I started out by pointing out the vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement between the two of us and </v>

219
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:33.663
<v Speaker 1>asked them about each one and more or </v>
<v Speaker 1>less I had been right about where we </v>

220
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:36.844
<v Speaker 1>agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I started going through the </v>

221
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:38.644
<v Speaker 1>list of places that we disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was a fascinating </v>

222
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:43.384
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely a closer to the </v>

223
00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:50.590
<v Speaker 1>conversation I hoped we would have won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feared we might have,</v>

224
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of progress.</v>

225
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Could you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you sense which way?</v>

226
00:12:54.961 --> 00:12:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Not that this matters in the grand </v>
<v Speaker 2>scheme of things,</v>

227
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.410
<v Speaker 2>but at some level it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which way the audience was going.</v>

228
00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:02.244
<v Speaker 2>Not that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that it is about who gets more </v>

229
00:13:03.631 --> 00:13:04.464
<v Speaker 2>cheers or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I do find fascinating about </v>

230
00:13:06.691 --> 00:13:07.524
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And although I didn't attend any of the </v>

231
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.920
<v Speaker 2>live events with Sam and Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

232
00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:11.754
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched some of them and just sort </v>

233
00:13:12.841 --> 00:13:13.674
<v Speaker 2>of noting a little bit of crowd applause</v>
<v Speaker 2>and jeers and pauses and things I think </v>

234
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:22.140
<v Speaker 2>gives you some extra taste that may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you guys on stage.</v>

235
00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:25.890
<v Speaker 2>You can't quite quantify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

236
00:13:25.891 --> 00:13:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

237
00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm a believer in that and it was one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most of them</v>

238
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 1>important tools that I used to use in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the classroom,</v>

239
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what people heard,</v>

240
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 1>how it landed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they don't yet have.</v>

241
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.053
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very cognizant of what people are </v>

242
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:46.450
<v Speaker 1>hearing and I was listening carefully to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience and um,</v>

243
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing was set in motion,</v>

244
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as another new atheist event.</v>

245
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.303
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was battling uphill because my basic </v>

246
00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 1>point was new atheism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a Culdesac,</v>

247
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem in and of itself.</v>

248
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

249
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.530
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem because at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of it,</v>

250
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.453
<v Speaker 2>there isn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that like the most simplistic way </v>

251
00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:11.820
<v Speaker 2>that I could present it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

252
00:14:11.821 --> 00:14:14.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just put it in stark terms.</v>

253
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Atheism is defensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but new atheism is wrong and new atheism</v>

254
00:14:20.731 --> 00:14:25.710
<v Speaker 2>is wrong because it portrays religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief as a</v>

255
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.233
<v Speaker 1>of mind rather than an adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non literal adaptation and so in a room </v>

256
00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 1>full of people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

257
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.413
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins is a very famous person because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people presumably showed up to hear a </v>

258
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of those people have at least</v>

259
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.493
<v Speaker 1>deep sympathies with the ideas of new </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheism and so somebody setting out to </v>

260
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:53.684
<v Speaker 1>say actually new atheism is an incorrect</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiation of atheism because it is </v>

261
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:03.461
<v Speaker 1>effectively ideological and and accuses </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have religious faith of being</v>

262
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:08.690
<v Speaker 1>mentally defective and in fact darkens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tangled over this.</v>

263
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:09.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

264
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:10.030
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

265
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.330
<v Speaker 1>you've called religion a mind virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an incorrect interpretation.</v>

266
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:15.141
<v Speaker 1>And at first he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

267
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't really mean anything deep by </v>
<v Speaker 1>virus.</v>

268
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:18.321
<v Speaker 1>He said it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

269
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:21.140
<v Speaker 1>you could argue that every gene in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genome is like a virus.</v>

270
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

271
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:23.774
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what people hear when you say that </v>

272
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.383
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're mentally ill for believing </v>

273
00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:28.580
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

274
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:28.941
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

275
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:30.530
<v Speaker 1>they are mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

276
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.393
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see the division in his own </v>

277
00:15:32.961 --> 00:15:33.711
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Because at that point he's then saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>both things at the same time,</v>

279
00:15:36.301 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Sandy's saying both things and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.403
<v Speaker 1>I understand his position about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could interpret each gene has </v>

281
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.113
<v Speaker 1>I could defend that position too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in order for there to be an </v>

283
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.233
<v Speaker 1>honorable atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to own up to what all that </v>

284
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:56.310
<v Speaker 1>religious belief was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I mean,</v>

285
00:15:56.311 --> 00:16:00.950
<v Speaker 1>and this is the place that I get into an</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier pickle,</v>

286
00:16:00.951 --> 00:16:01.784
<v Speaker 1>but a pickle with Peterson as well is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the question of if we acknowledge that </v>

287
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.873
<v Speaker 1>religious belief is adaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of the things that are true of </v>

288
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:20.900
<v Speaker 1>adaptive phenomena kick in and the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important one is that adaptive phenomena</v>

289
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.153
<v Speaker 1>are not timeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are adaptive relative to a </v>

290
00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:27.200
<v Speaker 1>historical time and place.</v>

291
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 1>And it may be a very long standing time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and place.</v>

292
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 1>But the point is there is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is purely magical thinking to imagine</v>

293
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:35.743
<v Speaker 1>that religious traditions that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years old are the core of </v>

294
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.983
<v Speaker 1>the toolkit for moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our existence in 2018 is so novel that </v>

295
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:48.374
<v Speaker 1>if there's one thing we can be sure of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that are adaptive nature is a poor </v>

296
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 1>match for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then can anything be truly timeless?</v>

297
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Is that the right question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

298
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way you do it is this,</v>

299
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.700
<v Speaker 1>the longer standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some truth of some kind is the closer it</v>

300
00:17:08.301 --> 00:17:10.310
<v Speaker 1>gets to being timeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

301
00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:14.630
<v Speaker 1>if we look at things that are um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very evolutionarily longstanding,</v>

302
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.363
<v Speaker 1>well those things have persisted through</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments that were very different </v>

303
00:17:19.761 --> 00:17:20.594
<v Speaker 1>from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that thread still </v>

304
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:26.270
<v Speaker 1>functions irrespective to an extent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the context.</v>

305
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.110
<v Speaker 1>The longer it lasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is to speak to truths</v>

306
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:32.990
<v Speaker 1>that continue to be relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

307
00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:33.923
<v Speaker 1>the bitter pill for modern people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect to understanding the degree to </v>

308
00:17:40.131 --> 00:17:40.964
<v Speaker 1>which evolution is the key to seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves properly is that we live in </v>

309
00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:54.801
<v Speaker 1>circumstances that are more novel than </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost any creature has ever faced.</v>

310
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know a creature can,</v>

311
00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:58.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish and flop into a boat and it's </v>

312
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:02.420
<v Speaker 1>suddenly a novel circumstances and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead within minutes,</v>

313
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell that to the dinosaurs and the</v>

314
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 1>media was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

315
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so novel that you know,</v>

316
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean dinosaurs didn't survive that one</v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

317
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.073
<v Speaker 1>the birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still with us and they're doing </v>

318
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:14.754
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are creatures living in </v>

319
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.423
<v Speaker 1>circumstances that are not only novel at</v>
<v Speaker 1>an unprecedented level but are changing </v>

320
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.220
<v Speaker 1>so rapidly that even to the extent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can figure out what to do,</v>

321
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.040
<v Speaker 1>the world changes out from under us.</v>

322
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.600
<v Speaker 1>We have to stop that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

323
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:34.434
<v Speaker 1>That is going to kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if you want to know what the </v>

324
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 1>greatest existential threat to humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

325
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 1>it is the rate of change that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>set in motion,</v>

326
00:18:43.141 --> 00:18:46.200
<v Speaker 1>which makes it impossible for us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt fast enough to it.</v>

327
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.980
<v Speaker 1>It has to be slowed down to a point that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can catch up.</v>

328
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.943
<v Speaker 1>Is that impossible though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we already have that power </v>

329
00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:56.640
<v Speaker 1>because I'm with you on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just from my limited knowledge of this,</v>

330
00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 1>just from what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

331
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:01.430
<v Speaker 1>from doing these shows and that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can watch more,</v>

332
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of information that you can </v>

333
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 1>intake on a given day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of things that you can share,</v>

334
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.090
<v Speaker 1>you can speed things up and listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them two times as fast.</v>

335
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.170
<v Speaker 1>You can clip everything and that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take all of this information.</v>

336
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Things can be live streamed like all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this bang,</v>

337
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:14.941
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

338
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:15.271
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

339
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:15.691
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

340
00:19:15.691 --> 00:19:17.430
<v Speaker 1>It's happening faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're learning more.</v>

341
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.310
<v Speaker 1>We know there's a great thirst for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

342
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.000
<v Speaker 1>but can it be slowed down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

343
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.313
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what force could slow down progress </v>

344
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:30.020
<v Speaker 1>really wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

345
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:30.883
<v Speaker 1>and that that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem is that we are </v>

346
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.740
<v Speaker 1>children in this landscape and children </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow up,</v>

347
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

348
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:43.140
<v Speaker 1>the key to raising children properly is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

349
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.033
<v Speaker 1>is to back off the things that protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>them enough that they actually get </v>

350
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 1>burned without being burned so severely </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're crippled.</v>

351
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.943
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to experience the places that </v>

352
00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:58.830
<v Speaker 1>your notions are naive in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become less night.</v>

353
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:04.580
<v Speaker 1>We are now in a situation in which we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are behaving in a childlike fashion in,</v>

354
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very,</v>

355
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.540
<v Speaker 1>in a foundry or something like that.</v>

356
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.403
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like children running around in </v>

357
00:20:11.021 --> 00:20:13.110
<v Speaker 1>the foundry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's molten metal that we need to,</v>

358
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to recognize it,</v>

359
00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:18.020
<v Speaker 1>how not to touch her were just pressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>every button.</v>

360
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Going buttons are cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's power.</v>

361
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.940
<v Speaker 1>We've got to stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

362
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm to be candid about it,</v>

363
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we are in an unrecoverable</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

364
00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I can see the path forward and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>still plausible as far as I know,</v>

365
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.073
<v Speaker 1>but I'm worried that we won't get there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason we won't get there is </v>

366
00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 1>that there are lots of things that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been true that just aren't true anymore.</v>

367
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.173
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are in love with a </v>

368
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.223
<v Speaker 1>limitless market in which you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that you can manage and it's </v>

369
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:52.744
<v Speaker 1>all cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the point we find out that </v>

370
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:55.474
<v Speaker 1>it isn't cool.</v>

371
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 1>We might have to take some action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the meantime,</v>

372
00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:59.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

373
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.173
<v Speaker 1>you're free to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sympathetic to this view as </v>

374
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be sympathetic to this view if I</v>

375
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 1>didn't recognize that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem in which,</v>

376
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:09.963
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the way our economic </v>

377
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 1>system is hooked up to our political </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

378
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem where anytime you set </v>
<v Speaker 1>a new force in motion in the market,</v>

379
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.850
<v Speaker 1>if that force pays a at a high rate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the short term,</v>

380
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Speaker 1>but it costs at a high rate in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm,</v>

381
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.680
<v Speaker 1>by the time you get around to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovering the costs in the long term,</v>

382
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 1>it has found its way into the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>system so that it cannot be reversed.</v>

383
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a system in which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't reverse things.</v>

384
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.103
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the simplest way to frame this would be </v>

385
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:41.050
<v Speaker 1>some sort of crony capitalism kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

386
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:41.884
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

387
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

388
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.843
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not truly free market because </v>

389
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 1>we've politicized a competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

390
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:49.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

391
00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I try to look at everything through an </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary lens and to me,</v>

392
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 1>politics and economics are just one more</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>

393
00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And they're interesting because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans and humans are,</v>

394
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially capable in this regard.</v>

395
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:08.080
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

396
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.023
<v Speaker 1>the natural tendency for a creature that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has found its way into a niche is to </v>

397
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:15.934
<v Speaker 1>protect its access to that niche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way creatures do that is they </v>

398
00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:23.640
<v Speaker 1>freeze other creatures out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is this natural pattern,</v>

399
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.230
<v Speaker 1>and I mean I can't not see it now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

400
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.273
<v Speaker 1>now that I've understood that it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this natural pattern where the </v>

401
00:22:32.111 --> 00:22:32.944
<v Speaker 1>upstarts who succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories that we know we don't know </v>

402
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:37.144
<v Speaker 1>about the upstarts that failed mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have startups that succeed end </v>

403
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 1>up tremendously powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they go through this process in</v>

404
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:45.124
<v Speaker 1>which they become hostile to upstart </v>
<v Speaker 1>newness and they become hostile to </v>

405
00:22:49.331 --> 00:22:50.164
<v Speaker 1>upstart and us for the most natural of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons which is that their wellbeing </v>

406
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.860
<v Speaker 1>depends on shutting down the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>through which they became successful.</v>

407
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.903
<v Speaker 1>So this could be like facebook buying </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of their competitors and things of </v>

408
00:23:00.701 --> 00:23:02.140
<v Speaker 1>that nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

409
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.513
<v Speaker 1>let's put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are obvious versions and then </v>

410
00:23:04.871 --> 00:23:09.400
<v Speaker 1>there are innumerable versions that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryptic and we,</v>

411
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.313
<v Speaker 1>we're never going to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole landscape of ways in which those </v>

412
00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 1>who have reached this level of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you and I will only dream about,</v>

413
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.110
<v Speaker 1>that they will then shut down the access</v>
<v Speaker 1>to others.</v>

414
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.193
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to call it a </v>

415
00:23:23.231 --> 00:23:26.320
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy because it doesn't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any consciousness to it at all,</v>

416
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:30.270
<v Speaker 1>but there is a tendency for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

417
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.650
<v Speaker 1>for those who have succeeded to shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the,</v>

418
00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.890
<v Speaker 1>the mechanisms through which they </v>
<v Speaker 1>succeed.</v>

419
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.753
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see this with a people </v>

420
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.013
<v Speaker 1>frequently remarking on the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants are often not that wildly </v>

421
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:47.270
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic about immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

422
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.440
<v Speaker 1>For obvious reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

423
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.293
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about do people who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>just entered at the bottom of the </v>

424
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.890
<v Speaker 1>economic ladder want more competition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

425
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:56.583
<v Speaker 1>they're actually a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tension between what people </v>

426
00:23:58.941 --> 00:23:59.774
<v Speaker 1>should want that you shouldn't imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some immigrant ness that </v>

427
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.110
<v Speaker 1>necessarily has you favorable to anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else who has that label.</v>

428
00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:07.203
<v Speaker 2>Does this also sort of explain a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of what's happening in the tech </v>

429
00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:12.940
<v Speaker 2>world right now in terms of it seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these companies,</v>

430
00:24:12.941 --> 00:24:13.780
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>

431
00:24:13.781 --> 00:24:14.614
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are potentially at least using </v>

432
00:24:16.781 --> 00:24:20.590
<v Speaker 2>algorithms against their own audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shadow banning people.</v>

433
00:24:20.591 --> 00:24:25.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean that they are basically now </v>
<v Speaker 2>turning against their own people because</v>

434
00:24:25.841 --> 00:24:30.841
<v Speaker 2>of their whatever they perceive to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own protection or longterm health.</v>

435
00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Even though I would probably argue in </v>
<v Speaker 2>most cases,</v>

436
00:24:32.981 --> 00:24:34.840
<v Speaker 2>that's not really what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

437
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without question.</v>

438
00:24:37.921 --> 00:24:41.430
<v Speaker 1>This is what's going on and let's put it</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>

439
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.310
<v Speaker 1>If you're at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in that strata,</v>

440
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.840
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot to lose through anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't predict,</v>

441
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:49.963
<v Speaker 1>and so there is a way in which we expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>the upstart who got there through some </v>

442
00:24:57.211 --> 00:24:58.044
<v Speaker 1>sort of radical transformation to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorable throughout a radical </v>

443
00:25:00.601 --> 00:25:01.434
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the way we should understand it is </v>

444
00:25:02.911 --> 00:25:03.744
<v Speaker 1>that once you've gotten there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical transformation becomes </v>

445
00:25:05.911 --> 00:25:06.744
<v Speaker 1>threatening and you start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatizing evolutionary force and </v>

446
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can look at what twitter is playing </v>

447
00:25:14.821 --> 00:25:19.821
<v Speaker 1>with these days with a potentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminating like some follower counts.</v>

448
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a breathtaking act of paternalism,</v>

449
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at best and are doing it for us,</v>

450
00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:28.621
<v Speaker 1>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

451
00:25:28.621 --> 00:25:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Because we shouldn't be so concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about who's paying attention.</v>

452
00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:35.590
<v Speaker 1>But really the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as we all recognize that there's</v>

453
00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.320
<v Speaker 1>a problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

454
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.270
<v Speaker 1>tweeting to get trivial likes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

455
00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:47.460
<v Speaker 1>understanding what your audience hears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they find favorable,</v>

456
00:25:47.461 --> 00:25:51.540
<v Speaker 1>what doesn't ring true to them is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way you learn,</v>

457
00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:52.374
<v Speaker 1>it's the way you steer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so effectively twitter is playing </v>

458
00:25:55.471 --> 00:25:59.640
<v Speaker 1>with blinding us so that we can say </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever we want into the void,</v>

459
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:03.450
<v Speaker 1>but we have no idea how it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no ping back to you basically.</v>

460
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.180
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to tell you,</v>

462
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.070
<v Speaker 1>you're a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're standing in front of the room and</v>

463
00:26:08.071 --> 00:26:08.630
<v Speaker 1>you get a</v>

464
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.880
<v Speaker 2>lot better when they laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better,</v>

465
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.450
<v Speaker 2>it's better when they laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

466
00:26:12.451 --> 00:26:13.640
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

467
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should we be thinking,</v>

468
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:17.840
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I get to that.</v>

469
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.240
<v Speaker 2>So as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just in a,</v>

470
00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:21.074
<v Speaker 2>in Europe and I did a bunch of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scandinavian and Nordic countries and </v>

471
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.063
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden was a particularly interesting </v>

472
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 2>case because I know that our fifth most </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewed country for this show is Sweden,</v>

473
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.560
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of fascinating considering</v>
<v Speaker 2>how tiny Sweden is.</v>

474
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

475
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I sort of circled that we did two shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Sweden.</v>

476
00:26:36.771 --> 00:26:39.200
<v Speaker 2>I kind of circled them on the calendar </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>

477
00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 2>something's going on in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to figure out what it is now.</v>

478
00:26:42.261 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I thought if you would've asked me </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I did the show that first night,</v>

479
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.760
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was gonna have a lot to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with immigration.</v>

480
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.463
<v Speaker 2>What I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there were a lot of questions </v>

481
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:51.414
<v Speaker 2>about immigration at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had much more to do with gender and </v>

482
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:56.874
<v Speaker 2>what is happening to their highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>egalitarian society that have done most </v>

483
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:05.220
<v Speaker 2>of the things related to gender and true</v>
<v Speaker 2>equality correctly for many,</v>

484
00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:06.054
<v Speaker 2>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of our friends on the left </v>

485
00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 2>always point to Sweden and Norway and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Finland.</v>

486
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:11.004
<v Speaker 2>These countries that I was just as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>examples of their perfect societies and </v>

487
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:16.880
<v Speaker 2>they're really struggling with certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you know,</v>

488
00:27:16.881 --> 00:27:17.714
<v Speaker 2>that the government's forcing them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have genderless kindergartens and that </v>

489
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:21.534
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emasculation of men and the removal </v>

490
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.623
<v Speaker 2>of the father and that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly Europe's first feminist </v>

491
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.823
<v Speaker 2>government and all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought as long as I have you here </v>

492
00:27:32.911 --> 00:27:33.744
<v Speaker 2>and since gender seems to be such an </v>
<v Speaker 2>endlessly a provocative and also </v>

493
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.490
<v Speaker 2>misunderstood topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

494
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 2>what should we do on gender right now?</v>

495
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

496
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.940
<v Speaker 2>well beyond you going to Sweden and </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out what's going on there.</v>

497
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:50.971
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

498
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:51.804
<v Speaker 2>what struck me as is that they've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything right in effect in terms of </v>

499
00:27:54.781 --> 00:27:58.050
<v Speaker 2>egalitarianism and they've done it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for decades now.</v>

500
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:00.750
<v Speaker 2>They've done it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they got to the end,</v>

501
00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:02.910
<v Speaker 2>which is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they got to the current day,</v>

502
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.700
<v Speaker 2>they realized that despite all of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>

503
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:06.534
<v Speaker 2>men and women are still different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That women still care more about people </v>

504
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:11.184
<v Speaker 2>and men still care more about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though they've been given the </v>

505
00:28:13.441 --> 00:28:14.274
<v Speaker 2>exact same opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are still becoming nurses and men </v>

506
00:28:17.941 --> 00:28:18.774
<v Speaker 2>are still becoming engineers and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the social justice warriors or </v>

507
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:22.584
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call that crew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still don't like the results of </v>

508
00:28:25.861 --> 00:28:30.030
<v Speaker 2>true equality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's why Sweden's in such a</v>

509
00:28:30.031 --> 00:28:31.800
<v Speaker 2>weird place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average person's like,</v>

510
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've done it right,</v>

511
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:34.980
<v Speaker 2>we did it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's equal.</v>

512
00:28:34.981 --> 00:28:35.814
<v Speaker 2>You can do whatever we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the result isn't being allowed </v>

513
00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 2>to be accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that,</v>

514
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.270
<v Speaker 2>does that make some sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

515
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.630
<v Speaker 2>it makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

516
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:42.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

517
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

518
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.360
<v Speaker 1>the naive left finds the failure of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis absolutely galling.</v>

519
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:55.523
<v Speaker 1>And so they're effectively trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>erase that failure by hard coding the </v>

520
00:28:59.011 --> 00:28:59.844
<v Speaker 1>solution into government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's exactly what's </v>

521
00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:05.010
<v Speaker 1>happening in Sweden right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's tragic.</v>

522
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:08.400
<v Speaker 1>And with respect to sex and gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is so needless,</v>

523
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:09.443
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is the truth of sex and gender </v>

524
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.413
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are parts of it we don't fully </v>

525
00:29:14.011 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 1>understand yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in general,</v>

526
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.003
<v Speaker 1>actually we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pretty much understand how we got </v>

527
00:29:19.261 --> 00:29:22.770
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is,</v>

528
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:29.370
<v Speaker 1>it is asymmetrical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a complimentary.</v>

529
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.090
<v Speaker 1>The truth of male and female is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complimentary truth.</v>

530
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.420
<v Speaker 1>It may be largely irrelevant in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>

531
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:37.523
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology has eliminated most of the </v>

532
00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:45.220
<v Speaker 1>basis on which the division of labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women initially evolved.</v>

533
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 1>So I think we have actually an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity here to become,</v>

534
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.673
<v Speaker 1>to behave in an enlightened fashion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the easiest place to solve this </v>

535
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:55.420
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insects and gender,</v>

536
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:56.523
<v Speaker 1>what we should do is pretty clear and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not hard to ground and evolutionary </v>

537
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:05.980
<v Speaker 1>theory because unlike other places like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a race,</v>

538
00:30:05.981 --> 00:30:09.130
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do know what to think with respect to</v>

539
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.090
<v Speaker 1>sex and gender and the.</v>

540
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.943
<v Speaker 1>The basic outline is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men and women are different for </v>

541
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:14.944
<v Speaker 1>historical reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The basis for that difference and the </v>

542
00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:23.371
<v Speaker 1>utility of that difference has largely </v>
<v Speaker 1>been neutralized by the modern world.</v>

543
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.920
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to retain those </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctions,</v>

544
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 1>but some of those distinctions are built</v>
<v Speaker 1>in at a deeper level than others.</v>

545
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:34.983
<v Speaker 1>So meaning you could potentially be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay at home dad and that could be </v>

546
00:30:37.301 --> 00:30:38.134
<v Speaker 1>perfectly fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that probably for evolutionary </v>

547
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:44.290
<v Speaker 1>reasons is not going to be the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that usually happens,</v>

548
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's your would be my point.</v>

549
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:53.040
<v Speaker 1>We can democratize access to almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>every with respect to sex and gender,</v>

550
00:30:54.911 --> 00:30:55.744
<v Speaker 1>there are very few places where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually need to have some asymmetry in </v>

551
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:03.370
<v Speaker 1>access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably,</v>

552
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the firefighter who comes into the </v>

553
00:31:06.851 --> 00:31:07.684
<v Speaker 1>burning building through the roof to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull you out when you're panicking and </v>

554
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what to do because you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never been in a fire before.</v>

555
00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on average,</v>

556
00:31:15.221 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 1>that should probably be a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just better built for it.</v>

557
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.850
<v Speaker 1>If there's a woman who is well enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do it,</v>

558
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:22.803
<v Speaker 1>should you be picky about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>firefighter who plucks you out of the </v>

559
00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.290
<v Speaker 1>burning building?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>

560
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally am thrilled to see it every</v>

561
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 1>time it runs against the narrative that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we expect.</v>

562
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:33.543
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

563
00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very fond of Stacey Brown,</v>

564
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:36.963
<v Speaker 1>the police chief at Evergreen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was driven out along with heather </v>

565
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.043
<v Speaker 1>and me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was great that she was </v>

566
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 1>female and that she was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an excellent cop.</v>

567
00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:47.893
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm up for the narrative being broken </v>

568
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:50.170
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

569
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by reality as often as possible,</v>

570
00:31:52.841 --> 00:31:53.674
<v Speaker 1>but you democratize the access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't force people to do what </v>

571
00:31:58.811 --> 00:31:59.644
<v Speaker 1>they otherwise would for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't even want to force it </v>

572
00:32:02.561 --> 00:32:05.830
<v Speaker 1>because for every job that you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

573
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:07.503
<v Speaker 1>force women into at some higher rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say engineering jobs because it </v>

574
00:32:11.021 --> 00:32:12.490
<v Speaker 1>sounds like a good thing to do.</v>

575
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.413
<v Speaker 1>There are some awful job that men are </v>
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately represented in that </v>

576
00:32:16.421 --> 00:32:18.910
<v Speaker 1>you would also have to force them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fair.</v>

577
00:32:18.911 --> 00:32:23.800
<v Speaker 1>So you democratize the access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You recognize that the division of Labor</v>

578
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:24.663
<v Speaker 1>that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have inherited is largely </v>

579
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 1>outdated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

580
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.430
<v Speaker 1>but you don't override people's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

581
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

582
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.150
<v Speaker 1>if women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you democratize access to engineering</v>

583
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 1>perfectly and women go into it at equal </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates,</v>

584
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.190
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't,</v>

585
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.340
<v Speaker 1>that's cool too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

586
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.040
<v Speaker 1>so in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

587
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a question of allowing liberty to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide where people go after you've done</v>

588
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 1>away with unnecessary barrier.</v>

589
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting because I think then</v>

590
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:57.950
<v Speaker 2>you hit it right on the head that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

591
00:32:57.951 --> 00:32:58.784
<v Speaker 2>Sweden's now politicizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're making a point of making this </v>

592
00:33:01.011 --> 00:33:01.844
<v Speaker 2>political because they will not accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>the science of what they've done </v>

593
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:06.763
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think at that is what is what has </v>

594
00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:12.600
<v Speaker 2>led this sort of average person there to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go this,</v>

595
00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:15.050
<v Speaker 2>this is just not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

596
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:16.363
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the way out is and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that most of the people there </v>

597
00:33:17.961 --> 00:33:19.310
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what the way I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

598
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

599
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.560
<v Speaker 1>the way out really is to recognize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

600
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:30.220
<v Speaker 1>the ire of the authoritarian left on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this point is actually indicative of the</v>

601
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:32.450
<v Speaker 1>whole problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

602
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.180
<v Speaker 1>because sex and gender is more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>

603
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.560
<v Speaker 1>the desire to erase it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrespective of the collateral damage is</v>

604
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:48.110
<v Speaker 1>an indicator of just how wrong this path</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

605
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

606
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I find this all the time where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

607
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.263
<v Speaker 1>if you're not focused on biology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're focused on the world that you </v>

608
00:33:57.771 --> 00:34:00.260
<v Speaker 1>find in your galled by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

609
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 1>by inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

610
00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:04.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just solve the inequality.</v>

611
00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:05.324
<v Speaker 1>Which is hard code the solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you hard code the solution and </v>

612
00:34:08.691 --> 00:34:09.524
<v Speaker 1>it says men and women of the same to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>extent that there's any difference in </v>

613
00:34:12.891 --> 00:34:13.724
<v Speaker 1>what they choose to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the result of a either cryptic </v>

614
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:20.480
<v Speaker 1>barriers or internalized misogyny or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

615
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.840
<v Speaker 1>and then the problem is you're now </v>
<v Speaker 1>interfering with my biology class.</v>

616
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.753
<v Speaker 1>You're now telling me that we that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>received wisdom is that men and women </v>

617
00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:29.744
<v Speaker 1>are the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I know damn well that can't be </v>

618
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:31.814
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't want to build a solution </v>

619
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:37.070
<v Speaker 1>that forces you to confront your </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologists,</v>

620
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.170
<v Speaker 1>physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your statisticians,</v>

621
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.393
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want all of these stories to the </v>

622
00:34:42.741 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 1>extent that they're true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to reconcile all true stories,</v>

623
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:47.204
<v Speaker 1>records to the extent that you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>naive notion over here and you want to </v>

624
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.453
<v Speaker 1>just write it in because it seems very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to you and you're willing to </v>

625
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 1>tolerate all of the cascading effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>

626
00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.580
<v Speaker 1>You don't belong in a position of power.</v>

627
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:00.503
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those people are in a position </v>

628
00:35:02.251 --> 00:35:03.084
<v Speaker 2>to power and I think we're seeing more </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them get into positions of power and </v>

629
00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also now having a counter </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect in Europe,</v>

630
00:35:08.341 --> 00:35:09.174
<v Speaker 2>which is why we're seeing the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>more far right parties because people </v>

631
00:35:11.971 --> 00:35:14.310
<v Speaker 2>are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw this,</v>

632
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.340
<v Speaker 2>this is so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take my chances over here.</v>

633
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:21.420
<v Speaker 2>People who inherently are not say far </v>
<v Speaker 2>right or certainly not racist,</v>

634
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.493
<v Speaker 2>are now playing with people that perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't have played with before </v>

635
00:35:24.751 --> 00:35:28.410
<v Speaker 2>because they're so sick of this and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm worried where that leads us.</v>

636
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

637
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I think this is exact and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you say this,</v>

638
00:35:30.981 --> 00:35:31.814
<v Speaker 1>is that you were afraid that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lunacy over on the authoritarian </v>

639
00:35:35.401 --> 00:35:37.400
<v Speaker 1>left is actually going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

640
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Speaker 1>it's collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to leave people who otherwise</v>

641
00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:43.290
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't play ball with the far right </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there,</v>

642
00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.870
<v Speaker 2>but not because they're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the key to this.</v>

643
00:35:46.871 --> 00:35:47.704
<v Speaker 2>It's not that they'll suddenly become </v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up and be racist or hate women or </v>

644
00:35:50.531 --> 00:35:51.364
<v Speaker 2>hate gays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will be such a disgust of </v>

645
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:54.880
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

646
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:55.723
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a rejection of what's provable that </v>

647
00:35:57.701 --> 00:36:00.460
<v Speaker 2>they'll going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least there's something over here.</v>

648
00:36:00.461 --> 00:36:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's awful bargain,</v>

649
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.970
<v Speaker 2>but I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

650
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I just think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see this,</v>

651
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:06.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

652
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 1>frequently where people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

653
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.163
<v Speaker 1>because they detect that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with communism and </v>

654
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:15.144
<v Speaker 1>socialism are often driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right pretty far into the let's not </v>

655
00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:24.411
<v Speaker 1>regulate anything camp and the answer is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have to regulate stuff just out</v>

656
00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.930
<v Speaker 1>of a desire to continue as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

657
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see people driven </v>

658
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.950
<v Speaker 1>because there's something wrong over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

659
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:32.784
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to be driven into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a reactionary position that is not </v>

660
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.073
<v Speaker 1>justified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing on sex and gender though is </v>

661
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.283
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is the key question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every reasonable person who just simply </v>

662
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.300
<v Speaker 1>observes the world knows that men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women are not the same thing.</v>

663
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 1>They know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

664
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:54.143
<v Speaker 1>those differences have an implication </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the way we view all sorts of things </v>

665
00:36:57.271 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 1>like mating and dating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what careers we want to have,</v>

666
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.620
<v Speaker 1>how we view risk and all of these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>for historical reasons.</v>

667
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.753
<v Speaker 1>All reasonable people can infer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>from just their own observations of the </v>

668
00:37:08.881 --> 00:37:09.714
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are now confronted with people who </v>

669
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.650
<v Speaker 1>insist that you not acknowledge what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see.</v>

670
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Those people are crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

671
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.393
<v Speaker 1>They're dangerously out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are dangerously out of control on </v>

672
00:37:23.851 --> 00:37:26.550
<v Speaker 1>other topics where it's harder to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's true,</v>

673
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.870
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't want people who were so</v>
<v Speaker 1>naive as to argue that men and women are</v>

674
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.460
<v Speaker 1>effectively identical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for depression,</v>

675
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.593
<v Speaker 1>in charge of any policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want them in charge of </v>

676
00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:39.570
<v Speaker 1>economic policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in charge of,</v>

677
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

678
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 1>a prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

679
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so having seen just how far their </v>

680
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:52.400
<v Speaker 1>confusion goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we all agree to shut them out of the</v>

681
00:37:52.411 --> 00:37:53.244
<v Speaker 1>discussion about how power is to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>wilted and the rest of us can have a </v>

682
00:37:55.531 --> 00:37:58.830
<v Speaker 1>discussion about what our values are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we think we know,</v>

683
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.440
<v Speaker 1>what we don't yet know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what its implications are.</v>

684
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:02.603
<v Speaker 1>That that's the place we should go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like an effective ending </v>

685
00:38:06.061 --> 00:38:08.400
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want to throw in one more.</v>

686
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Did we not hit something that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>rattling around in your brain?</v>

687
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a know I covered a lot of territory</v>

688
00:38:15.271 --> 00:38:15.870
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

689
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.520
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's always a pleasure sitting down</v>
